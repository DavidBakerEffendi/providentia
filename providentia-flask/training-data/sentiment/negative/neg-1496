This is probably the last time I'll come to this place.  First, they're waaayyy over priced!  Second,  understaff & last but not least the food was terrible.  I ordered on the phone and told them I'll pick it up and they said it'll take 20 min, so I waited.  Got there 20 min later and still waited 10 min and the server served my food in a styrofoam and just laid it and said "enjoy" I was like fine...I looked at the chicken and it was burned and rubbery!  Server kept apologizing and wasn't listening to me as I told her I only had 30 min. Of break and wanted the new chicken order in a foil since I've been waiting.  In short don't come here unless u want good fresh fries and hummus are the only stuff I liked.  Terrible and disappointed.
