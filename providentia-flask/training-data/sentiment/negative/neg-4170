The worst burrito I have ever eaten. 

Like others have previously said, the burrito I had (steak) had no flavor. The steak was at the bottom of the burrito so most of the burrito I ate consisted of beans and rice. I found it interesting they charged extra for cheese as seeing that's a core ingredient in a burrito. I didn't experience any rudeness from the staff so that's what earns the 1 star. Other than that, I'd avoid this place all together. I just wish I had checked Yelp before ordering this mess.
