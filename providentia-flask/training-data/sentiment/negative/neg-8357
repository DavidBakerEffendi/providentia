I have tried time and time again, to get myself to like this place and every time it's more disappointing than the last time. 

I had a take out order today, and when I called to place the order, I could tell that instantaneously, the bartender taking my order was not going to be a pleasure. Well that was an understatement. 

When I arrived to pick up my order, there was class A attitude from the minute I walked in with the bartender. Then I had a total of 5 bags and 2 fountain drinks (which she said she had absolutely nothing to put them in for me), and I asked her if she could help me carry the bags to my car.  Her reply "no. I have tables I need to take care of." 

I don't expect over-the-top service at this restaurant, but I do expect a smile, a nice and pleasant attitude, along with a little helpfulness. If you aren't having a good day, don't take it out on customers.
