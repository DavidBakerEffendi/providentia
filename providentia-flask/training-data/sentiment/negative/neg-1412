These hot dogs are soooo over rated.  The" MOST Disgusting"  hot dogs we've ever tried in our whole lives.   We couldn't even eat them. WE chewed the and spat them back out.  everything about them was sooo gross.    And to think we paid $5 for each what a waste of money, if you are thinking about coming here save your money and go somewhere else.
