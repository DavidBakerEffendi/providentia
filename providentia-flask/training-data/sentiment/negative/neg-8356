This Domino's location doesn't even deserve a star. I placed an online order and was excited to eat the thin crust pizza. It's usually good, and very saucy. 

The pizza get's made in under 10 minutes (wow). The quality check took over 20 minutes, and the delivery took even longer. I called the store, and they said the pizza left the store and it would be there soon. 

I'm patiently waiting, and nothing... FINALLY my driver calls me and is parked at the wrong location. I gave him directions and he still couldn't figure it out. I left my work and said I would meet him on the street, he parked his car on the other side of the street and expected me to cross 6 lanes of crazy traffic on Bay in order to get the pizza. I said I won't do that, please come to my side. I paid for delivery, and so It's only fair. 

He was very rude and finally came to my side. I took my pizza back to work, and when I opened it, it looked gross. It looked like delivery pizza that you put back in your fridge. It was SO COLD!!!!!!!!!! I took a bite and was so upset. I called the store and the guy kept making excuses, I didn't want my money back or a free pizza, I just wanted some proper customer service. NOPE! This guy could not care less. I was beyond disappointed and as I'm writing this review, I feel so sick. I took a picture and a video of my cardboard pizza so you can see for yourselves. 

This was the worst pizza delivery experience I've ever had, I'm going back to Pizza Nova. 

DON'T EAT HERE!
