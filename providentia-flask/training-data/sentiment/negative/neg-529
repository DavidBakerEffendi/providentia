We really love fish tacos, and thought this would be a good place to try.  We were wrong.  The rice was old and crunchy, they didn't have the shrimp that was on the menu, the fish was way overcooked and bland, and the beans were inedible.  Perhaps we got them on the wrong decade.  We are very particular about our food and will never be back to this place.  I cannot understand the better reviews on this place.
