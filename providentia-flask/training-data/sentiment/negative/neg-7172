They do not cater to vegetarians unless you want to pay $16 dollars for your burger. I tried to order the New Jack Burger without chorizo sausage and to sub out a black bean patty.... Yea that's all... And the bartender told me no. If I wanted the black bean burger I had to a.) order it the way it came off the menu which was drab and boring provolone cheese and mayo or b.) build my own black bean burger. Now the new jack city burger with a meat patty costs $10 dollars on the menu. It features avocado, pepper jack cheese, roasted red peppers, chorizo sausage, and a salsa verde. When I added up the items on my build your own burger with no chorizo sausage and a veggie patty the burger cost damn near $15 dollars. I get that they don't want substitutions but I don't see the big deal in subbing out a veggie patty for a meat one... When asked to speak with manager she said the same thing. No. Being in the restaurant business I cannot imagine telling a guest no when you have all the means and ingredients to sastify them!  I left B spot without eating and have no intention on returning.
