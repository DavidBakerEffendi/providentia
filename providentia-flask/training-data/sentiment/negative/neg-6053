After successfully avoiding this place for the two years I've lived in the area, I finally decided to give it a chance. Huge mistake. I'm not sure what I expected from this sketchy looking restaurant, but I thought I might be pleasantly surprised. The food here is disgusting, every dish, every ingredient tasted rotten. You really get what you paid for, and what are you paying for here is garbage. Also, they will try to scam you whenever the opportunity arises. I ordered the beef in tomato sauce on rice, I simply asked for the rice to be put separately from the beef and tomato sauce, and somehow I cannot do that without being charged more. They also use MSG in everything here by default. If you want fresh, tasty, good quality food, DO NOT come here. No pleasant surprises await you.
