Recently purchased a Groupon for this well-rated restaurant.  Wanted to use on a Friday night, but at the door we were told that the Groupon wasn't accepted on the weekend. OK, we are already here, so we'll pay full price.  At 8:00 pm on a Friday night no wait and not even half full.  We were promptly seated and ordered some cocktails.  Waited 10 minutes, finally the server brought drinks, but not what we had ordered.  We waited another 5 minutes, no drinks, so decided to leave.  As we were walking out we met the server who had our drinks, but too late.  

Again, the restaurant was not even 1/2 full on a Friday night prime time.  Doesn't speak well for the longevity.  Will try to take advantage of our Groupon soon.
