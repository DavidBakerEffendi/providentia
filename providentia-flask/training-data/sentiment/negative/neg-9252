Eek. This is not a fine dining restaurant with a fun twist. This is ill prepared vegan food that you eat in the dark. And as many reviewers have already commented on and I can also confirm, the food is served lukewarm and is tasteless until you get to the overly sweet desert. I swear it is like grade school cafeteria food.....only vegan style.

The owners have to be pinching themselves in disbelief at what people are willing to pay (myself included) for the craptastic food just because they have the lights off. 

I need to open a knock off across the street for $10 bucks less per person and actually serve edible food and I would have lines out the door! Seriously you can expect to pay $100 per person (including tax, tip, and one drink) for a $3 meal. 

You will laugh, and you will be heading someplace else to eat afterwards.
