Yikes! Bad food safety practices. I stopped in and ordered two chickpea veggie salads, which are always super delicious. But today, the guy making the salads was bugged because he had to go to the back room to get more lettuce. He returned with a big tub of lettuce, holding it from the bottom (it looked dirty) and dumped it in the "lettuce drawer", then took the empty tub back to the storage room. When he returned, he made my salad by grabbing the various ingredients with his hands (wearing the same gloves he had on going back and forth to the storage room). He looked for some tomatoes, but there weren't any, so he slammed the fridge door, and left in a huff for the back room again. He returned with A FISTFUL OF TOMATOES! Wearing the same gloves, arranged them on my salad. I have no idea how many door handles, etc, he touched, but it just seemed super unsanitary. The guy at the register felt bad about the whole thing, so he didn't charge me...but I ended up throwing them out. I'm not sure, but I think the little huffy guy making the food was the manager.
