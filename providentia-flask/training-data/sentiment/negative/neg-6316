Very disappointed with our recent experience at Fibber McGee's; it was the exact opposite of our first experience.
The waitress, from the moment we walked in was inattentive, rude and seemed resentful. No greeting at all other than "sit wherever you want". After we seated ourselves it took at least 15 minutes for her to come by so we could ask for menus, she went to get them then tossed them on the table without a word. Another long wait and she finally came back for the order which we placed and then asked her for drink menus. Getting 2 beers took another 10 or 15 minutes. When she brought our meals she just quickly dropped them at the table then turned around and walked off. We waited about 10 minutes before we saw her again so we could ask for utensils and napkins. It was about 10 more minutes before she brought those and tossed them on the table. It was a weeknight, not very busy when we went and we made no special requests (other than asking for menus and utensils) so I can't understand why service was so incredibly slow. I have no idea what her problem or why she exhibited such a bad attitude but it definitely left a negative impression and we haven't been back since. 
It's really too bad that a waitress' attitude can make what previously had been a great experience turn into something negative. Our first experience at Fibber McGee's had been very positive and I really want to like this place...maybe sometime we'll give it another try to see what the best two out of three brings.
