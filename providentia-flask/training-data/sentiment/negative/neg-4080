The place was great when it first opened and a few times after that. WHAT happened? Quality of the food definitely went down and so did the service. The Kalbi was all gristle and talk about skimping on the Panchan (small side dishes), which came out late. They usually bring those out right away. We saw tables that got theirs even though they came in quite some time after we did. We came between 7:00p till about 8:30pm and the service was SLOW. The part that really got under our skin was the unbelievably RUDE and un-attentive waitresses we had that were waiting on us. Definitely not the norm for Korean restaurants. They never smiled. Had no patience. And when my mother asked one of the waitresses a simple question about the side dishes the table next to us was getting (as they had the side dishes we used to get the first few times we came to the restaurant--A LOT more and varietal), she literally gave my mom a dirty look and blurted out an answer that neither of us could understand. My mom looked at me and I had no idea what she had said so, my mother asked again. I don't know if the woman was speaking Korean because it sure didn't sound like it to us and that's my mother's native language. Regardless, she was annoyed because we kept on asking her what she was saying. The woman literally walked away. It was time for the check. It's sad because we really liked this place and always had a good experience before. Granted, we used to come during the day but, it still doesn't give them the excuse to have terrible staff in the evenings not to mention, lower the quality of their food. That was definitely disappointing to say the least. The bathroom had a bad leak of some sort in one of the stalls, there was a pool of water in the stalls. I mentioned it to one of the staff members because someone could slip and fall. The woman didn't even stop to listen to me.
