Arrived at 11:45 party of two. We were 2 of 4 people in the restaurant at that time. Ordered shortly after being seated and were quickly served water. By 12:50 we decided we were going to leave because the restaurant was at capacity with other customers who were all enjoyjng themselves and eating and we had yet to be served!! We inquired a few times why the wait was so long, only to be told that they would speak to the kitchen... Only when we started packing up were we told the food will be ready in a few minutes. I dont want to say it was because we were the only black people there because this behaviour is unacceptable to any paying customer. No reason I should arrive 30 minutes before the couple who sat beside me, who took forever to order and watch them eat a full spread whilst I sit hungry begging to trade my perfectly good money for the same food. I'm mad as hell, wasted my damn lunch on a very busy day. It's a damn shame I can't vote zero stars.
