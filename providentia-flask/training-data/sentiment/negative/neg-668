It saddens me to write this review. I am truly a big fan of Top Golf. I've played in Houston and it was love at first site.  I would rate the Houston location 5 stars. This location is the exception. The biggest strike against it is that it plays short... meaning you must leave all your woods (metal) in the car. The only thing you can hit are your irons. For a driving range, this is sacrilege!!!  Their "long drive" game is no more than a 4 or 5 iron.  Someone seriously messed up when designing this location.  To add to the disappointment, the staff (including the manager) acted as if I should be grateful to pay the high rates for the pleasure of working only on my short game.  Therefore;  I say "never again".  If you can't take the big dog out of the bag, grip it, and rip it, then how can you call yourself a "driving range"?  This location would be better off calling itself "Short Golf".  I felt like the director in charge at the time was the "Soup Nazi". Her attitude was "you will like it or you get no golf". What a shame for this brand. 

So, if you don't really want to work on your golf game and all you want to do is eat, drink and hit some balls, you'll like this place once you get through the long lines and slow service. The "Top Golf" concept is amazing; however, the execution at this location is poor at best.
