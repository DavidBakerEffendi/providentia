Everyone has an off day and I take that into consideration when dealing with people. The owner Russ needs to take a course in customer service. We will never ever order from them again so boycotting Leonardo's and telling everyone we know in NR/Strongsville not to patronize them. There are at least 7 Pizza Places in a 10 mile radius of his store. He is so rude and he needs to step back and realize his pizza and sandwiches are not going to sell its self, it is only Mediocre.  Maybe you should stop being short and nasty to your customers. He actually hangs up on his customers before they are finished ordering.  I will not go into the long explanation of what he actually did but I will tell you he will not be in business for long.  As a repeat customer my family will not put up with his antics. Read these reviews because what they are telling you about his service and quality are all true.  Hard to believe but Leonardo's is not worth the trouble for the way he treats customers and the quality of his food.
