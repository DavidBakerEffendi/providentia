When in Vegas go to a buffet, but not this one!!!
So the plan was to go to the Bacchanal Buffet, unfortunately there was a 5hour wait, and we did not want to wait. After a quick look at Yelp this was the "next best".

Way over priced $40 something for the buffet plus another $16 or so for mimosas. I don't mind paying that price if the food was good, or the selection was vast.
The food was bland, no big selection. It was like hometown buffet or such establishments.
