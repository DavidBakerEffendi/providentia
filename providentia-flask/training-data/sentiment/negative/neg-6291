If you have a dog with you, as many people in Tempe do, don't go here. The employees and the manager here will turn you away on the basis that their drunk customers will mess with your dog. Do yourself a favor, take you and your dog to Handlebar, spend the same, or more(!), amount of money there because they will accommodate you and your pet with the amount of respect that you deserve.
