We should've reconsidered when we saw the dog walking on the bar...seriously!!!  I like dogs, but this was too much. This dog was on the bar most of the time we were there, until a customer, who seemed a regular, picked it up and put in on a bar stool.  There was also another dog comfortably seated on one of the bar stools.  Not sure why we didn't walk out then, but...  After being seated, noticed tabletops were not clean, ditto for the floor.  There was only one other table occupied, so we figured at least we'd have our food quickly.  It's a small, dark place, but has a large, although not attractive, patio.  The service was good, and we had our food in a timely manner.  The Caesar salad was not crisp, and was drenched in dressing. There was no fresh Parmesan or croutons, which at $14, was overpriced.  The Toscano pizza arrived, undercooked in the center, and not visually appealing. There were abundant, but not fresh mushrooms, and the "fennel" sausage had no flavor of fennel.  There was not much flavor except of mushrooms.  I would never return to this restaurant, and would highly discourage anyone else from eating there.
