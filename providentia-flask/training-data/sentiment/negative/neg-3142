Brief editorial of when I went to eat here. I first ordered a taco salad an that was very low on meat with hardly any sour cream and hardly any guacamole either. I said something to the young lady who worked there that day and nothing was done. Anyways I went back there to give a second chance an ordered something else to see if it was just a first time mistake which we all know happens. So I ordered fish tacos and a burrito on a lunch visit to go. Well being in a hurry got me a dry taco with nothing on it an then overcharged on my receipt as well. I called back an the girl somehow knew what I was talking about automatically an said to stop back by to grab what she had overcharged me. About $3 overcharged an I only ordered $10 worth of stuff. So if I hadn't noticed they would've made off with some extra dough. Overall if you can go elsewhere do so but if you choose to be careful of what's being ordered an what's being charged. Take care an I hope this helps also.
