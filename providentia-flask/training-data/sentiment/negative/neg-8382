Not vegetarian friendly. 
Not customer friendly. 
I asked for water. 
Basically choked on edamame. Asked. Still didn't get it.
Had to go to bar and get my own water.
Was not happy with the meal I got, and instead of asking what I need/want the waiter was like "well I told you what it was" 

Hmm. 
Ok.

Never going here again. Even if there's a free Brussels sprouts/fried pickle offer when you check in.
