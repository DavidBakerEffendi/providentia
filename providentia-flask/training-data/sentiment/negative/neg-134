it was really bad. 

Walked in and smelt like sewer. Seriously I can't believe the place remains open. I am going to contact the health department. 

The restaurant is in very bad condition. The whole place looks run down.

Food was Filabertos level. 

Do not go here. One things for sure is people dont know real good food. Those reviews and reviewers are crazy.
