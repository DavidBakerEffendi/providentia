DO NOT EAT HERE!

3 pizzas, 3 toppings each, 3 drinks, 1 salad - small, 1 order of (it's not labeled as spicy and you LITERALLY ONLY GET 2) meatballs =$80!!!

The pizzas tasted ok, not $80 spectacular.

We're they fast? Yes.
We're they 90 seconds fast? NO!

The 2 meatballs cut in half went in at the same time as the pizza. They were ready 10 minutes after we got the pizza!

The "vinaigrette" for the salad tasted like pure vinegar.

I will never eat here again and will tell everyone I know to avoid this gimmicky robbery.

My husband is what stopped me from telling people in line to leave! I've eaten all kinds of pizza. Gourmet and chain - this place is lousy.
