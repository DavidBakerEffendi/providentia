This place is unbelievably bad. I finally cancelled my order after 35 minutes, everyone else had their food, but it was served at 5-10 minute intervals. 
-Chips and Salsa served, about 15 chips for a table of 5 people.
-drinks served intermittently
-food served at odd intervals
-cancelled Sinaloa Sushi after 35 minutes. Lots of apologizing, but no indication that there would be an extended order time for this. 
-we could only find very faint remnants of any kind of meat on 3 different orders. Only potato and very large mounds of shredded lettuce on everything. No difference in flavor or filling from different items.
I really don't understand how this place has a 4.7 star rating - it is the worst food experience I have had in Phoenix in 2 years. Maybe people really like potatoes boiled in beef broth?
