Stopped for breakfast today... Once sitted it took a while for the waitress to get our order, after waiting at least 30 minutes and watching 2 tables that came in after us being served we left of course paying for 2 cups of coffee and a hot tea ( which water was cold couldn't get the waitress attention) which was 6.00 plus tax outrageous. We will not be back
