VERY SAD ! first its damn near 40 $.  for the first thing they start dinner at 3.30 I got in line at 10 till the line moved 3.15 i'm at the register . i'm asking this will be my dinner tab not brunch . 4 people could not give me a straight answer. crab legs they know why we are there get in find out no crab legs till 3.45 . next , one king crab station 80 PEPPS IN LINE . TOOK 31 MIN. TO GET MY LEGS AND THEY WERE FROZEN.YOU HAVE TO RING  THE WATER OUT OF THE MEAT. GOT BACK TO MY TABLE IT TOOK SO LONG THAT THE WAITRESS CLEARED MY TABLE .AND SEATED SOMEONE ELSE .EVERYBODY WAS YELLING AT THE LADY MANAGER IN THE ORANGE JACKET SHE WAS NO HELP .the line was winding all the way through the other food stations nobody can serve themselves to the other fair . man ! what a joke nowhere near the quality of food like when steve wynn owned it .. the last time i'm going there .its now a over priced downtown buffet . GO SOMEWHERE ELSE !
