Very disappointed in our visit. Went on a Friday to bowl and eat/ drink. The staff was not welcoming and even forgot to tell us which lane to go to. 

At the lane we waited for 10 minutes for a server before finally asking a girl if she could wait on us. She said we weren't here lane, but she ended up waiting on us. Needless to say, service was SLOW! 

About halfway into our bowling somebody puked over the balcony onto our lane. It was 20 minutes before anybody came to clean it. They proceeded to clean the puke with a rag and a bottle of spray cleaner, even though we told them it was vomit. The manager said she thought it was just a spilled drink, even though several people saw this happen. The manager only offered to add 30 minutes to our bowling, but after the horrible cleaning job we declined. She then said she would email us coupons for free games......we never received them. 

It seemed like a nice place but they really need to get their act together and work on customer service before we consider going back, especially since they were pricey!
