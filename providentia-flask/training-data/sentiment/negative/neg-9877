I am here with my friends. We ordered apolla fish, idli manchuria, andhra spicy dosa, chicken, lamb and egg biryanis. With 4 star rating I expected it to serve from good food. They are pouring food color and oil in their food and are very greasy. They taste very average. None of the dishes were even satisfactory. I am totally disappointed. I am not going to come back here again.
I advice the chef to please reduce the food coloring and a bit of oil in your dishes.
