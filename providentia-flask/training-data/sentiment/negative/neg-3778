Tonight was our second visit to the Porch. The first visit was not great. The drinks were good and somewhat quick, but the food took forever. The manager "apologized and said they were new and working through issues".  Tonight my girlfriend and I decided to give them another try. We were seated right away and ordered drinks. It was nearly 20 minutes until our drinks arrived, and my drink was wrong. They quickly provided a new drink to me and then we ordered food. We ordered pork belly nachos, hummus, and wings. The food arrived in 12 minutes (quick). The order came out wrong and they agreed to correct it. The pork belly didn't taste or look like pork, but only pork is listed on the menu and not beef (I do not eat beef/cows). I kept questioning the pork, but with no beef nachos on the menu, I felt like I was eating a dry pork. It then took another 20 minutes to get a second drink - my drink was wrong, again.... The bill finally came and it said "short rib nachos" on the bill. I flipped and asked why they served me beef when it literally says PORK BELLY NACHOS on the menu, and was told "pork isn't on the menu anymore". Nobody told us that. The restaurant does not train their staff and has only one bartender to serve the entire seated restaurant. This place is a mess and I can only imagine what it looks like behind the scenes in the kitchen. I would avoid this place until they get their act together. The manager was nice both times, but nice doesn't equate to running a successful restaurant.
