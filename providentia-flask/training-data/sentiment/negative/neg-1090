Off the beaten path and you can either park yourself at the $4 parking across the restaurant or valet for $4. The decor is really nice and thats the only nice thing about this restaurant.

Food pretty much sucked and what sucked more was that everyone in our group got their food at different times. At the end of it all, all of us felt like we overpaid to still feel hungry. Everyone ended up going to a Chilis afterwards to have a proper dinner - which says something about the portions and food at Kalu's, doesn't it?

I am NEVER going back here and wouldn't recommend anyone to even try the place. If you are really desperate for some Asian food and don't want to go to any other restaurant around, I'd suggest some microwaveable Asian food from Harris teeter and a dinner while watching TV instead. :)
