Just got out of Rosh Hashanah services and ready for something to eat. Thought NY Deli would hit the spot. So sorry we chose NY B'N B. We give our order and the bread is soggy. Why? Because they washed the dishes but didn't make sure they were dry before putting the bread on the plate. The chicken soup was so salty we couldn't eat it. The Knish was greasy, and the pastrami was definitely not NY Pastrami. If you're from NY you know what I'm talking about. We eat as much as we can stomach and decide rather than wasting the food we would take it home. Don't know why. The waitress brings us two huge takeout containers for a half a sandwich and nothing for the soup. I question if I was to pour the soup into one of the sandwich containers and she stares at me and then asked if I want a container for the soup. I make a sigh. She comes back with a small container meant for cream cheese spread. Even I can see this isn't going to work, but I try. I was right. Between soggy bread, over salted soup, Pastrami no self respecting New Yorker would dare serve, and a waitress that seemed to need a lot more training, we left feeling sad for the experience. If you want a really good Deli that truly honors NY, go to Scott's Generations on 7st and Glendale Ave. But as for NY B'NB, forget about it!!
