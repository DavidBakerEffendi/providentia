We went here to watch the Vegas Knights game, so we were there for a few hours. We sat outside which was nice, we got to see the pregame festivities coming by. Our server was pretty terrible. Anytime we needed anything we would have to flag her down. She would come out to bring food to one table & not check on any of her other tables. We started with a few small items, then we ordered a pizza. We wanted black olives on it, but we were told that they do not have them, no worries. When the pizza was brought out by someone other than our server, we asked him for Parmesan & red pepper, he seemed a little bothered by that & replied "give me a minute". Well after 10 minutes I just ate the pizza without it. When I saw him walk by later I said "you never brought us our Parmesan & red pepper flakes".  His reply was "oh I told you're server to bring them to you" & he turned around. No apology, no accepting any sort of responsibility, nothing. I've never had a server respond to me in that manner. I will never be back & would definitely not recommend anyone to go here. Oh also, one of the other problems is there is only ONE men's & ONE women's single stall bathroom for the whole restaurant!!! Ridiculous, I don't even see how that is legal!
