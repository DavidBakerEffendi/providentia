No. Just no. Never again. First of all. We waited 13 minutes just to ORDER our drinks. Then we waited an additional 30 minutes to order our food and keep in mind. Another party came by and they ordered drinks and food right away once they sat down AND got their food way before we did. I understand that in the menu, it states that there will be a little wait since it's just the cook and an assistant but damn, we waited over an hour to just get our food. And they got better service once they sat down than we did. I ordered the carnitas and my mom and Brother got the chimichanga. Let me tell you about my carnitas. Or should I say, Manteca (fat). Where's the meat? It was hiding. I literally had to dig inside the fat and cheese  to find it! The beans, were ok. Just boiled regular pinto beans with no salt and added cheese. The rice was actually ok but I was so disgusted to eat anything. My brother and mom liked the chimichanga but skipped the rice and beans. In the meantime that I was trying to find my carnitas in the Manteca, no one. But I mean NO ONE checked on us to see if we needed anything else or to see how the food was. The waiter didn't even ask if my food was ok since I left the whole plate when we asked for the check. He just bypassed it like it was normal. What a disappointment. I'm sorry but I will NEVER return and will not recommend to anyone!
