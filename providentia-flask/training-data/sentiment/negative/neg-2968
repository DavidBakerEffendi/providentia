Judging by the other reviews for this Subway I'm glad I didn't purchase anything. 
I just needed to make an emergency pit stop and was turned away because I didn't buy anything. I held my temper and my urine till I got home 45 min away! Ran a couple red lights but made it safely home. Yes sir!
Boooo to Subway!
