I got the groupon for this place and decided to try it out with my family and another family after church. I can say that this place was overpriced for the amount of food that you get. We got the south american, the waffledilla, and the bannanatela and I was not amused. the food did not have any flavor and the chicken tasted like it came out of a can. It tasted like a watery sponge. It was very chewy. it also lacked flavor. the Waffles that came with every meal were over cooked and very dry. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Once I finish of this groupon I will never go back waste of 40$ P.s. their self proclaimed Frankenstein espresso wasn't not even strong or filled to the top. I got a large and it was filled halfway. Did I say it was expensive??!
