If I could give a half star I would. Horrible place for families. Rude staff. Screw up your order and then rude you when you call him on it. Try to cheat you. And God for bid you pull out a coupon. Just Say No To This Wendy's. Instead of remodeling the building they should've remodeled their staff. Horrible management. Those poor employees.
