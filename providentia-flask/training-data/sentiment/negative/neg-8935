Horribly atrocious service!  Avoid it at all cost!

Have you been to an AYCE restaurant and LESS than half of your order came out?

have you been to an AYCE restaurant where the attendant refuses to deliver your order because according to her I ordered too much? (There were three of us and each only ordered three items... We actually ordered LESS than our regular non-AYCE order)

Have you been a restaurant that when you complain about the above lack of service the manager actually defended the staff?
