$70 bucks for poor service, watered down pasta, and a free loaf of garlic bread you have to search for on the menu.......inquire about with the waiter........and then constantly remind because they accidentally forget over and over again........me thinks not. Also I'd like to peg them for false advertising their sign outside says ask us about our $20 four course meal and then you get inside and you realize that 2 our of the 4 courses was a glass of water and the mint at the end. Too high priced for me.

*UPDATE*

Tried to go here for a conference and was so off put by how they treated our group that we forfeited a catered meal and took our business elsewhere.
