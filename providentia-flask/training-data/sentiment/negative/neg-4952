Crap food, crap service. Not sure what the appeal is here. the place was dead we waited an hour for our food, I could have made my own eggs and bacon by that time and at 10$ a pop could have fed 20 people. One piece of bacon and runny eggs (ugh). The service was terrible too, we were outside and it was warm, our server never came by to check on us, apologize about the wait, fill our drinks etc. People with larger tables were getting their food and we had been there longer, truth be told she probably forgot about us. When she did resurface she smelled awful, like cigarettes. I love a good dive breakfast place, this is a dive but far from good.
