Called at 5:30 to make a reservation for 6:00 dinner. Person on the phone said no problem. When we arrived, we were told there were no available tables. The worst part was their attitude, which was " too bad...you'll just have to wait!" We left and went elsewhere. Won't be returning due to a very poor handling of a customer service situation. Management seemed not to care.
