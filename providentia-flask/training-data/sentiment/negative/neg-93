One of the worst sushi places I've ever been too. Sushi was not fresh what so ever, so for the people saying it's fresh, I really don't know if we are talking about the same restaurant. The waitresses were all so rude, pay the extra few bucks and go someone good. The sushi here literally tasted like complete crap. Not to mention i felt sick, when I left. The menu seems like it is so big but if you genuinely look at it and read it, everything is the same just a few stuff was added to make it seem different. Disgusting place, and I also saw the waitress drop the soy sauce lid off the container and she put it back on as if no one saw. Hygiene here needs to be improved, this is exactly mall sushi in a restaurant, but mall sushi is for sure better than this place. Please pat a few extra dollars and go somewhere good.
