This was the worst experience at a hotel I've had in a long time. Since it was President's Day, they were not allowing you to select two Queen beds versus a single King without paying an additional $35/day for the "upgrade". I understand the suite is also bigger, but it's ridiculous that other hotels have two queen beds or one king bed as a standard option whereas here they try to gouge you for as much money as possible. In the past, I've never had to pay for an upgrade for queen beds. I even expressed my disappointment to the manager at the time, that there was no flexibility on this, and she was extremely rude when replying. They were also super rude when we tried to call for an hour extension on our check out time, and made it seem like it was the world's greatest favor to even give us a half hour extension. 

The worst part is that the hotel isn't as nice anymore, and it's age is definitely showing with the outdated decor and furniture. 

Based on this experience, I will NEVER stay at the Venetian or Palazzo again, and neither will my friends. There are many hotel options in Vegas, and I'm not going to put up with this crazy BS from The Venetian again.
