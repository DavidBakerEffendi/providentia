Wow.  Absolutely discusting!  I put in a delivery order for me my husband and 2 kids.  So it was a good sized order I guess. The girl on the phone asked me "Anything else" after everything I said.. so annoying. We ordered chicken phili, 12 plain chicken wings, and 2 kids pastas, 1 alfredo 1 spaghetti. The phili had mushrooms onions and peppers that were black from being burned to death and there were like 5 strips of chicken on this huge roll. The kids meals were ridiculously too big.  I couldn't have finished one. And then for a side with the pasta a whole Styrofoam full of fries for each kids meal!  All the food was awful to eat. No taste at all. To top it off my husband bit into our 3rd chicken wing and it was green.  Yuck! I won't even get into their gross sauces they provided with the wings.  I would have to say the worst food I've ever had. Ever.
