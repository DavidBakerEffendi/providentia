Maybe it's okay for others but it really was the worst noodles restaurant I've been too. This place looks so outdated chopsticks were sticky.  As well the menu don't even have picture to visualize what I am going to get. I ordered a Sichuan spicy noodle soups, sounds spicy and hot! When it came out omg, there's mince eggplant and filled with mince garlic and a spicy oil which is not even spicy at all. I literally just took a sip paid my bill and left. Thinking about that noodle soup  was just nasty it was a nightmare!
