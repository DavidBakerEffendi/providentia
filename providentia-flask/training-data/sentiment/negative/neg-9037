Horrible. Just horrible. 

My group shows up on a Saturday afternoon to find one employee in the whole business. There are several tables and the same lone employee is responsible for taking orders, cooking the food, serving the food and collecting payment. Needless to say, service was slow. 

The food itself was medicore and severely overpriced - you can pay up to $10 for a tiny sandwhich. They clearly do not use premium ingredients - it's basic cheap food at a premium price. The cake was store bought and the cheesecake was served at room temperature (eww).  

The worst part of the trip was the extreme dishonesty or unhygenicness. The server/cook/cashier/owner refused to serve us tap water. When I asked why, she said that it was because the building had "bad" water. The water wasn't bad enough to stop them from using it to cook, clean (their hands and the dishes) and to use in the washroom. So either this is a filthy restaurant knowingly using (but not serving) dirty water, or they are crooks who try and trick their customers into buying pop, bottled water and coffee. Lies like this insult everyone's intelligence, and they ruined our lunch.
