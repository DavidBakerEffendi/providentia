I am so disappointed!  I've been here many times and have previously left great reviews but my recent order was a big let down.

I placed a Yelp order to go for pick up and ordered my usual Sauce favorite, the Chicken Caesar Salad Pizza on hand tossed crust.  I also ordered caprese bruschetta.  While I didn't take a picture of the bruschetta it was made so sloppily.  I was surprised by the presentation but it still tasted delicious.  

However the pizza/salad is basically inedible.  This isn't the usual quality of food I have come to expect from Sauce.  I've ordered this menu item a dozen times at least over the years.  But this time the lettuce is brown and wilted and there is an excess of dressing making it goopy and inedible.  I'm so bummed.  Sauce, how did this pass your usual flawless quality control?  That's what I love about Sauce it's been consistently good food, don't fail us now!
