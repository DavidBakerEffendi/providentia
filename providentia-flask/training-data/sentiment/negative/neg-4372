Not good for takeout ... so disappointed ! I'm normally a fan of this place when we go ( mainly the Ray and Dobson location ) but today I ordered takeout and was soo disappointed . 
My chicken shawarma wrap was cold ( you can tell it was never even heated ( just thrown together like slop .... I would've appreciated if they would have at least microwaved the "hot wrap -- mainly the unfresh chicken ). 
I also ordered a kids Mac and cheese and received A tiny handful of Mac and cheese - over cooked , soggy, and old br√≥coli - And dry chicken ...even my kids refused to eat it ! 

My advice would be to make sure dine in so that your able to at least view your food - I wouldn't recommend this place for take out . Maybe other locations at best
