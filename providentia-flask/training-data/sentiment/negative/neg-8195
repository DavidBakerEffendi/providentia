This used be be one of my absolute favorites places to order Cromwell. My daughter and I have been ordering for a few years now for both lunch and dinner. They messed up an order for the first time the other night. No big deal, called and they fixed it. So today I was bragging to a coworker about their amazing food. We ordered lunch and talk embarrassing!! They changed the way the lunch comes (meat and veggies used to come in a small plastic bowl and the rice in the little take out box. Now it's all in a small bowl with literally a scoop of meat and veggies in a bowl full of rice.). When I called to ask about it the lady said she "I don't know anything, I just work here. There is no manager. Oh he'll be here tomorrow, no we are closed tomorrow". And now you have to ask for utensils as well. Which the lunch specials come with soup, so when you ask for utensils you think you would get a spoon as well. It's sad you cannot get employees who understand customer service.
