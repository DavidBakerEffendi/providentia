I am usually pretty forgiving on pizza places. Each area of the country has different tastes. But this stuff is aweful. In the hopes of getting something close to a New York style pizza I ordered their thin crust. The entire pizza is about 2mm tall, and the crust reminds me more of a thick cracker than pizza crust. 

The thing that irks me the most is that they talk about how fresh their ingredients are and that they make all their dough in the store, yet my pie has pizza press marks on it, like you see at the movie theater or roller rink pizzas. Not always, but usually the sign of a prepackaged dough.
