The unfriendly atmosphere at The Harmony Bar is its biggest failing.  At first I thought it was just sarcastic "Soup Nazi" humor, but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees, customers, and even performers.  I've seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customers.

Also, it's downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band.  I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights, jumping up on the stage, and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show's over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave.  I was floored.  It was the first time I'd ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early.  

The kitchen staff works hard, and the food is decent.  Unfortunately, this is the only bar I've ever been to in Madison where I've been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front.  (There are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab.) It made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service.

In short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar.  There are too many other fun places to go in Madison for anyone to have to put up with the miserable buzz killing atmosphere that prevails at The "Harmony".
