Worst experience ever! I have been many times to this restaurant, lately it has started to fail as a business. Service ... texting while working. Grabbing the food to serve with fingers. Dishes not clean. And the food you order goes to the wrong table or what you order they make something else. I was here the other day and we waited to be served anything from our order. It was 50 minutes to receive one roll. It was in the counter ready they just didn't serve. I asked why only two servers. "Oh our manger just decided to walk out and go boxing for the day" really ? So we cancelled the other half of our order didn't want to wait another hour. I hope the restaurant gets their stuff together. Whether changing management or getting more servers or ones who know how to handle food in a clean manner. Won't be returning. To Hanna Sushi I go for now on. Can always count on great service and food there.
