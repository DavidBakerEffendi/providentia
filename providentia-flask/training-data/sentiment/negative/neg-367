We only went to Grazie because we had a Groupon. This was the filthiest restaurant I have ever been too. Every table was COVERED with dirty dishes and food. Our pizza was horrible. I would have rather had a frozen pizza at home. Never again.  I am sorry for the harsh review but it was really that bad.
