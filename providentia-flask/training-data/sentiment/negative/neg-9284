Tried for first time on Monday, Chicken was excellent but insanely overpriced, probably to pay for snob appeal of being in Summerlin, enclave of the yuppie nouveau riche. C'mon  4 bucks a thigh? and gut basket of necks and backs, $8 WTF! Despite all that my wife loved it and I drove all the way again from Henderson and got a blue ribbon, half a chicken, liver and onions....$40 for that what was I thinkin'??? Anyway that order was bland and KFC had more flavor and livers were bland! How do you get bland livers!?!?!?!? I called the mgr. and She said she didn't know and could be a different batch of seasoning and said she would call me back but never did with her "Oh well" attitude. So glad there is Popeyes' , Churches and KFC that I don't have to decide  to either buy chicken or make a house payment  Between the  insane prices and inconsistent flavor quality, I should have gotten a side of Astroglide $10 for 2 drumsticks!?!?!? $8 for 2 wings!?!?!? I can only guess I ate a Cosby pudding cup before I went there and ordered.
