This place has the worst customer service!  We walked in 7 deep ready to eat and the young hostess says ok 45 min wait, so we reply ok, than a second hosted looks at our party and states um no that will be 1 hour to 1.5 hours at least after looking us up and down. Our party is quite colorful and diverse with a few small children. I said so you don't want us here and looks at me like no and replies well if your party wasn't so big, WOW!! That is not ok.
