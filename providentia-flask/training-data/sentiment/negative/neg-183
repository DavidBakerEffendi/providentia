Food was not bad BUT major red flag!!!! When we closed out waiter did not take any accountability to split the check, told me to spit the checks (between 7 people) when I asked for the manager, he backed his waiter vs. taking a customer service approach and listening to me and understanding. Instead he elected to explain in Vegas that is the standard protocol and that is how it is. I've eaten at several 4 and 5 start restaurants and by far, the most disappointing in customer service and management. I would not recommend this business due to management and their lack of customer service. The palms should be ashamed to have such a poor staff representing their facility. Go to del friscos or Ruth's Chris' where they value their customer and go out of their way to accommodate their customers paying $60+ for good food and service.
