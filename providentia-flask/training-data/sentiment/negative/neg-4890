I need to let everyone know what horrible service I received at the chandler zoës a few moments ago. It's a simple complaint but one that has me vowing never to return to this location. I want to add I'm not a one in a while customer to zoës as I have 85 check-in's at the McDowell and 7th Av. location and have been a huge fan of zoës since the day they first came to town years ago. I simply wanted to substitute another item instead of the mushrooms to the vegetable kabob dinner as I've done many many times in the past with no problems. Not today as the girl working the register told me that the kabobs are premade and she couldn't substitute another vegetable in place of the mushrooms. I asked for the manager and he was basically an asshole and didn't won't to help me with my predicament either. I have been a super loyal customer on my personal time and an even better customer with sending my business clients zoës to their offices on a regular basis. That was until my horrible experience today. Goodbye zoës
