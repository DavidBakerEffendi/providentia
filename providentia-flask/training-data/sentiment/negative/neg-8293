First let me say as a new parent it is extremely hard to go anywhere as a family let alone enjoy a nice meal so when I heard it was restaurant week I dug in my heels and was determined to enjoy a nice meal, even with a toddler in tow. I saw Upstream on the list of restaurants participating and the menu looked great so me, my husband and 15 month old drove 1 1/2 from Hickory for a fun family night.  

From the beginning it was bad.  I was told only a few items on the menu was included in the $30 meal and everything else would include an up-charge (which was not on the website when I looked it up).  Ok fine, so I order the crab cakes for appetizer...they were completely bland and had NO salt, like none.  For my entree I ordered the lobster which was the grossest thing I've ever attempted to eat in my life. 75% of it was raw and still had it's guts oozing out.  My husband was in denial and thought it was sauce but when the waiter confirmed this he almost threw up.

So we sent it back and got the scallops instead but they too were completely raw...not even a little done.  Like they were in the pan for maybe 5 seconds and that's it.  The manager finally came over and told me that they generally under cook most of their seafood.  I've never heard of a restaurant doing this but they should at least let the customers know.  I would have told them I like my food dead not alive.

The only thing I had to look forward to was the apple crumble.  How can you mess that up, right?  While it wasn't completely bad, it tasted like one of those cheap diner desserts with lots of apple jelly and no dough.  

Needless to say I won't be returning here and wouldn't recommend this place at all.  The only good thing was the service but I can't eat that.
