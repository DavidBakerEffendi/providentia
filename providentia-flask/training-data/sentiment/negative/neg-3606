I placed a pizza order at 10:30pm and estimated delivery was 12:30am which was okay, and expected it is now 1am haven't received my pizza have been waiting 2 hours for food that isn't going to show up... If they were not up for delivering that late, a curiosity call would be great so I don't sit at home hungry.. I'm currently on hold, they picked up the phone at 1am clicked it around and hung up.. Terrible customer service.. Why stay open that late if you cant fulfill deliveries at that time...
