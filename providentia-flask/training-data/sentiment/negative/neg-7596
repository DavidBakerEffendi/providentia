I guess we don't f***ing learn.

My wife went here this morning to take advantage of their 2 sausage biscuit with egg McMuffin deal for $3.33.  She ordered 2 of them for $6.66 and it turned out to be a devil's deal.  They charged her for 4 McMuffins and gave her only TWO.  This isn't the first time I've been shorted a McMuffin here, but it is the first time I came TWO SHORT and I'm getting pretty cheesed off.

They always give replacements when you go back and speak to the manager, but how about not having this garbage happen in the first place?

Down to one star.
