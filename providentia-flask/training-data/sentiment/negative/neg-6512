I am furious. Came at 11:00 am. Our waiter comes over to take our drinks,and i tell him i want a boba milk tea, and without even taking everyone else's drink orders he runs back to the kitchen to go make it. He later comes with four waters and we finally tell him what the rest of us actually wanted to drink. Ps dont get any of their specialty drinks bc they all taste sour! No wonder theyre all buy 2 get one free. The tables before us were still waiting for their food and they all had a problem with their food when they finally got it. Our appetizer came 30 minutes after we ordered it, and every table who came in after us got their food within ten minutes, weve been waiting for our food for 40 minutes already! When the server was about to serve the most recent table their food, we yelled for him and ask him what happened to our food! And he gives us the most dumbfounded look and runs back to the kitchen. We didnt even get ONE apology. There wasnt even one server who spoke vietnamese, and only ONE chef in the kitchen. Does it make sense that there are THREE SERVERS and ONE CHEF working in a sunday brunch?! There were 5 families in the dining room! We finally got our food AN HOUR LATER. LITERALLY.  I can understand if the kitchen is coming out with the food slow, but the fact that our server didnt even put in our order is what made me mad! When the owner finally came to work thats when food started actually coming out the kitchen. We still had to ask the servers for bean sprouts for our pho too. 

Whoever the owner is, please teach your wait staff how to give good customer service. We had 3 boys serving us and none of them gave us good service.
