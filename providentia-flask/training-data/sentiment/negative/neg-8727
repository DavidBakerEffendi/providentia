I've been to the new and improved layout twice now, and twice now its taken forever to get food.  This time it took 15 minutes to get my food at 10pm at night.  To boot, they put my large sweet tea in a cup with a hole in the bottom.  Made a huge mess on me and the car.  Just drive further down to the Steels Corner McD's where they have their act together.
