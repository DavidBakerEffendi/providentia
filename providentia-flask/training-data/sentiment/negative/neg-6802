This pizza was so nasty. I paid 50 bucks for a whole pizza and salad. I was so disappointed with this cardboard they call pizza. I don't see how these other yelpers gave it a good review.  We ordered half pepperoni and other half spinach with ricotta   cheese  and tomatoes. Pepperoni was sour spicy and smelled bad. I like thin crust but this crust was cardboard. You will have a better experience if u just order dominos pizza. Make sure you give a tip or u will be ignored by the staff.
