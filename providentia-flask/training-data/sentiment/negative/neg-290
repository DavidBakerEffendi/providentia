I am honestly shocked by the good reviews but I guess I am glad others have a better experience here.

Hadn't been to this location in over 3 years due to mediocre service and food. Went today to see if anything has changed. Nope.

Gave us tots instead of fries. Made the Slush Floats were ordered weird... it's suppose to be a slush with ice cream inside UNBLENDED. If this is how they make them now... um... alright. They did not add my mom's petezel dog despite telling them the order repeatedly and when we pushed the button to correct this we were met with nothing but some rude guy. Pretzel dogs with bacon and cheese are suppose to have bacon bits. They gave us a big ole slice of bacon across the dog. Makes it harder to eat. Why I am not surprised that they are too lazy to cut up the bacon slices like in the picture.

Goodbye forever, Sonic.
