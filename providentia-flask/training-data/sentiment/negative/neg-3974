Extremely rude staff. I went there last night and got a boot, which is PLASTIC and requires a $20 cash deposit. I paid the $20, got the boot, and when I tried to give it back to get my money back they claimed that they didn't have it. I watched him pin it up on the wall, but apparently he put it in the wrong spot so that's somehow my fault? I asked them how I could have possibly gotten the boot without paying the $20 and they had no answer other than to say they would check the bartender's tip jar. Funny thing was, it was the SAME bartender that sold me the boot to begin with. I had to argue with the bartender and I believe his boss (?) to get MY money back and they kicked ME out? Will never be returning here.
