The reason I am ready to give this place a one-star rating is not because of the quality of the food or the wonderful chef who prepares the sushi but the quality of service I have got for the first time visiting this establishment. When I first walked in, it was not busy at all, maybe around 5-6 people sitting down and have lunch. I was not greeted at all by rather I grab a menu for myself and go sit at any table. Second of all, the waitress saw me and decided to go to the back and enjoy a lovely conversation in the back about g-d knows what. Third, I was never helped with any orders or asked if I wanted anything to drink. I did however see other people getting 5-star service but it just happened to be that "today wasn't my day". 

I don't know if I'll be back because of how I was treated. On to the other restaurants around.
