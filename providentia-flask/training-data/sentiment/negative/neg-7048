The menu looked delicious but what I ordered wasn't what I thought it would taste like. The Mexican bowl wasn't a satisfying taste. I love spice but this wasn't it. I literally had to drink water every single time. The quinoa was too simple and the beans were too seasoned. The veggie burger was ok. I tasted better. Overall not sure I'll be back but I won't ever order those items again.
