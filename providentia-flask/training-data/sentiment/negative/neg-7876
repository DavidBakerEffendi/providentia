This was a terrible experience, the manager was extremely rude when we asked for credit back on New Belgium Winter beer when we are in June! This is un acceptable and I'll never go to a Fox and Hound again. We ordered a New Belgium beer in June that turned out to be a winter beer and was 4 mounts past the beers expiration date. We didn't drink the beer because it tasted so horrible, but the manager Chris Davis still would not give us a credit and called us "rude" for asking for a credit on old beer that tasted horrible and was expired. This is ridiculous and I will never go to Fox and Hound because of our experience with Chris Davis.
