Every time I go here the food is gross and bland. This time I thought maybe if I order something simple it won't be disgusting so I got ravioli and it came out bright yellow. Last month when I was here a waitress was shoved down onto the ground at a table nearby and in tears. The lady who shoved her actually got up from the booth she was sitting at with her party to shove the waitress down on the floor. I honestly couldn't believe it. This time I was on the way in with my Dad who wanted to go there for lack of any better ideas tonight and I overheard a man leaving who said "we are never coming here again".
