A friend of mine from school recommended me this place, so i decided to visit. The decor is very odd and messy, the tables were greasy with dried rice on the chairs and dried sauce stains on the chair as well. The people that were working there was very rude. So i decided to get the student deal, since it seems like a good deal.
In the student deal you get a quarter piece chicken, rice and potatoes. The chicken was dry, the rice is bland and potatoes were decent.  The price for this dish was $4.99. Pretty much you get what you paid for. Not worth it. Better try somewhere else!
