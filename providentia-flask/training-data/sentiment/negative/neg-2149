One word - AWFUL!  I bought a groupon for the restaurant thinking it was a great deal.  I would have much rather donated that money to a homeless person.  First off the place was tiny, maybe 10 tables or so, that should've tipped me off.  The salad bar was awful, everything looked dry or wilted - I've seen better salad bars at $4.99 buffet. Most of the salad trays were empty and we had to ask for them to fill them.  I asked for fried bananas bc it was empty.  The cook refilled it with 3 slices.  SMH.  The same 6 meats kept coming around (and yes I can name them!!!).  When we asked how many kinds of meats they were serving, the only answer they could give was "a lot".  We counted - it was a total of 6, for almost 2 hours the same 6 kept coming around.  When we asked for sodas the woman who waited on our table did not speak English and just kept filling up the water - we asked for soda several times until they finally brought us our cans.  Do yourself a favor and go to In and Out and pocket the other $60 you save!  You'll be much more satisfied than eating here!  Wish I could get my money back.  Such a poor excuse for a Brazilian churrascaria - If anyone thinks this restaurant is even worth coming to, they obviously have never eaten at a real quality, top notch Brazilian bbq.  So disappointed and would never recommend it!
