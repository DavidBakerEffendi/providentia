Stay away from this place!  The service is atrocious if they condescend to appear at your table.  So don't be surprised if it takes twice as long as a meal normally should because the waitstaff never returns to your table.  The food is decent but very overpriced for what you get.  Burgers are OK.  Their more restaurant-like entrees are feeble if not down-right bad.  The salads are fresh but the salad dressings are hideous.  Atmosphere is decent.
If you decide to go, bring cash.  Our waitress took liberties with our credit card.  And the owners seem to like to complain and get bad reviews filtered...
