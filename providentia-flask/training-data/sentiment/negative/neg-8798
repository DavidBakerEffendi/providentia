My son nailed it, Choolaah is to Indian as Chipotle is to Mexican, a sad cartoonish imitation of the real thing. We had great trepidation as we approached the glass and stainless edifice, but on looking around found that it was filled with South Asian people, so figured what the heck, they probably know better than us.  

The naan, though seemingly made fresh and right in front of us still had the consistency of cardboard, without the crusty backside and pillowy soft interior one hopes for; it was more like a cracker, without the big bubbles a hot tandoor should produce. 

The BBQ chicken was OK, as long as you weren't expecting something like Tandoori chicken. Like the sauces provided it was just bland and uninteresting. 

To top it off, the meal was not cheap; nearly $30 for two of us. The only saving grace was that they offered several varieties of interesting bottled beer. 

It probably really deserves two stars, its not as though the food was nasty or disgusting, just boring.
