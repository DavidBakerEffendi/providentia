This is strictly a review on their lunch sandwiches, which are mediocre. Coffee is coffee, gets the job done here. I made the mistake, however, of ordering a California Turkey sandwich...at $8+ I expected more. I wouldn't be happy if I made that sandwich at home, let alone buy one. Go to Subway or stick to coffee, just not good at all, for sandwiches. Stale bread, tiny sandwich, two slices of turkey, one tomato slice, and a tablespoon of avacado. Most importantly, not even tasty, basic, basic sandwich. I'll pass...
