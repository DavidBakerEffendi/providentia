Like so many others on here, I have to give 1 star to leave a review. After the last couple of orders of garlic knots I've ordered being over cooked (burnt), I guess I figured that if I asked specifically for them to be cooked for a less amount of time, that they would get the hint that I did not want them burnt again. Nope. Still burnt. Still totally frustrated that even having to wait 10 min in their store that they would actually do them right. When I expressed my disappointment in the outcome, I immediately got attitude about it. Another 15 min they wanted to re make the knots. Forget it, I'll just give them to a homeless person. Will not spend anymore time and money at this location. Hopefully after enough negative reviews, corporate will get wind of the crappy products coming out of this location and fix something.
