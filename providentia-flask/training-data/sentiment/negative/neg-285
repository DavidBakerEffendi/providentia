The WORST service EVER! Fish fry was TERRIBLE. Fries over salted and burned. 2 pieces of fried cod and it took 1/2 hour for waiter to return to ask if we wanted more ( all you can eat) Neglected to tell us that salad bar was included with meal. Cajun pizza was SOGGY (crispy crust... NOT!) had to ask for water 3 times. Only saving grace was the manager came to apologize and offered a gift card. Some lucky winner will get this card for the GAME SHOW SHOW!!!
