I visited this Olive Garden location today, they seemed to not have enough people on staff which wasn't a big deal as it was kind of slow. However the waitress I had was never there and I was without water for almost the entire meal. I ordered the chicken Alfredo for lunch and it was very small for $13. When the waitress did show up at the end of the meal to bring me my check she refilled my glass almost entirely with ice and spilled ice and water all over the table in front of me and didn't even pick it up. I was also only brought four breadsticks the entire meal.
