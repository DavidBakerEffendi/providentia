This place is below standard.  We went for dinner. Food was cold and pre-made. They just reheat the premade dim sum and noodles to us. Except one dish which seems it is freshly made. We ordered soup also badly made. The heart of the wonton was frozen...why?????? 
I do not recommend this place. Also, very poor service...
