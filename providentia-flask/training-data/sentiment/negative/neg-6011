If i could give this place negative stars I would.  We have been going to Taharu for years at the Tempe location and never had issues. Apperantly this must be the red headed step child because the service is bad... Walked in when it was dead at 2 pm it's 314 pm and still don't have my order that I placed. I flagged down the server to have her tell me she doesn't know what happened to my order but if I want I can pull from the bar I could do so. The whole point of using the order form was because what I wanted wasn't on the bar.  No refills on drinks even after asking,  Horrible service. If I come back it will be the Tempe location since they don't leave you hanging for an hour and then loose your order.
