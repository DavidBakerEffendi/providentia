Fix your menus. Started a bad experience by being told, after a few minutes, I was looking at the wrong menu. If it is the wrong menu why is it 3 feet tall and fixed to the side of your truck? After being given the option to order off of the very limited, randomly placed selection of food photos, I ordered the California burger. The one marked $5.50 in two separate places. I was then told it would be $7.50, because apparently the avocado on a California burger is extra. At this point I just walked away. If I can't clearly order from you and be charged the listed price you're not worth the time, or the cost.
