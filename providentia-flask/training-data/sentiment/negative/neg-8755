Just tried to stop in for a bite with the family. With no other seating options available for our group of five, we attempted to sit at a long empty table in the rear of the patio.

Unfortunately, the server rudely informed us that the table was reserved at 6pm for a party of 24 and that they didn't want to rush us. Very nice of you not to rush us, but it was 3:55pm and we would have been long gone by 5:30pm. Then she simply walked back to her station and made no offer to accommodate us elsewhere in the restaurant. Handled horribly.

We are currently enjoying much better service at a neighboring restaurant. We frequent the area but we'll be sure to avoid the attitude here.
