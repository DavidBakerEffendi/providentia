Worlds tiniest portions.  Wings so small barely any meat on them.  We ordered the breakfast skillet egg whites w extra egg...pretty sure it was only two eggs.  I'd never come back again.  
Service was good 
All games shown 
But I came here for my Sunday football cheat meal 
What a waste!!!!!
I have no clue how they could ever win best of Phoenix for wings 
When the waitress came by to fill our waters she said they were running out of ice.  I don't know how that's possible at noon on Sunday during football season
