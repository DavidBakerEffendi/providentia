We were excited to try this noodle place.  After ordering at 11:45 when the restaurant was nearly empty, we became more and more puzzled as people filled the restaurant. Barely any noodles had come out (maybe two bowls in our vicinity).   We called our servers numerous times to alert them when half an hour had passed,  then 45 minutes but all the servers looked dumbfounded and walked away from us while we talked.   This was a seriously disrespectful and overall a ridiculous experience.   At the 50 minute mark,  we just walked out.  What type of business is this? 

Don't waste your time coming here.
