Very very poor food. 

Ordered postmates with this one. I was less than impressed.

Tonight I ordered chicken fingers hot with bleu cheese on the side, as well as an Italian sub with extra vinegar on the side.

Fingers were decent. Pretty straight forward with these.

Italian sub was mediocre at the very best. Soggy bread, quality of the ingredients were lacking and overall flavor of the sub was poorly executed.

I will not be ordering from them nor would I give the shot of going there to dine..

Blah
