if I could give 0 stars I would!!I was super pumped to go here because of the real world and looked like so much fun.  We are greeted(not really) by a bouncer who makes me take my hat off and take a picture(and was super rude about it I felt like a criminal)  The bar promotes a free champagne deal that I wanted to take advantage of.  I walk up to the bar ask the bartender if it's still valid he completely ignores me and walks away give someone a beer and goes to open a champagne and push it towards me without asking me anything.  I was sitting there super confused and amazed someone could be so rude.  First of all I asked about the promotion which didn't mean that I wanted the champagne and he didn't ask me what else he could get for me or anything.  He was so rude!!!  After that I was completely turned off and left the bar(which was very lame btw)  What ever happened to customer service?  Who wants to go to a bar with super rude staff and who takes pictures of you when entering a bar.... Not me!!!
