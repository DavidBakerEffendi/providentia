We usually go to the Mohave location, but decided to try the store on Cactus instead.  We ordered chicken tacos, chips and salsa, guacamole and Carne Asada tacos.  The tacos were bland and had very little taste. The chips were stale and the salsa lacked taste also.  The guacamole was pretty pathetic too.  There are way too many great Mexican Restaurants in Phoenix to waste my time here.
