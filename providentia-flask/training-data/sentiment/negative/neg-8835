Terrible experience. Ordered a pound of chicken wings and got 7 wings- supposed to come with celery and when I asked for it the waitress rudely said they didn't have any without any alternative option. After asking again for another option she finally brought out some celery- obviously didn't want to put the effort in the first place to bring out the full order. My son ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and there was no buffalo sauce in the wrap- just too much lettuce, ranch and blue cheese with a  few small chunks of chicken. Haven't ever had a restaurant experience where everything went wrong until tonight. This place is abusing the fact that they're located in an airport and most of their customers are one time customers that won't be returning.
