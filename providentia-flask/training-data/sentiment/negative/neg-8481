Took my parents that were in town from Chicago to Ncounter and our omelett, french toast, and potatoes were cold and soggy. We ordered at 10:50am and received our meals at 11:20am.. 30 minutes to make a few meals? The only warm part of our meals was the syrup. Very upsetting considering nobody apologized for the delay...You'd think a restaurant would have one or the other, great food or customer service, if not both! Today Ncounter lacked both.
