My only issue with this place is with who had control of the jukebox. Played a bunch of songs and they straight skipped 5 of them. Not played over by play now but straight skipped them. Heard all 5 come on for about 5 seconds and then heard them all get skipped. Asked the bartender why my songs got skipped and she acted like the only way that could happen is if someone played now. I said how come every song came on for 10 seconds before getting skipped. If you know TouchTunes you know songs you play over don't start before getting skipped they just go further down the line.
