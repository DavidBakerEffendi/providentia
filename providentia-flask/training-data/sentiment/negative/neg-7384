Hmmm where to start. Being positive, the food was good and the coffee was hot. But my service, man it was horrible. It took 15 min to get our lattes, my friend ordered a coffee and got a latte, asked for a coffee again (not drinking the latte) and was charged for a latter not a coffee. 

The female waitress wasn't friendly at all. It seemed as though it was only her waiting tables whilst a gentlemen was seating people (he was friendly). 

Although the food was great, I won't return because of the bad service. I mean even though my taste buds were happy, waiting 30 min for waffles while hungry is just ridiculous.
