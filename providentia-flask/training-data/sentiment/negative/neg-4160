Please note I am middle eastern and my expectations of hookah and a hookah lounge are probably very different than a non middle eastern hookah lover.

as soon as we walked in we were greeted very nicely. the staff was very polite...no complaints there... my start rating is based on environment and hookah quality.
 
the place was practically empty since it was a random Thursday night. we had three people in my party. we sat at the big comfortable corner, they asked us to move since there was a minimum of 4 to be able to sit there. that bothered me since the place was empty and we wanted to be comfortable. not to mention It was not a smart business decision since my group of three middle eastern women were going to each order one hookah which is more than what a group of non middle easterners would smoke which Is generally one per two people (which is Another rule of theirs.. minimum one hookah for 2 people)
the hookah prices were high but I guess that's just vegas
my hookah and my friends hookah had an overwhelming mint flavor. when I told them, they switched the hose out and I ended up with a plastic china hose instead of a traditional hose. not ok for me.
they didn't like that I took the foil off the hookah head, but I don't like to smoke like that.

the place is not a place to go if you are hoping for a traditional middle eastern hookah experience. i don't want to wrap the parameter of the heads w foil, i don't want to sit on couches that have no backs, i don't want to smoke hookahs that are sitting on top of tables (hard to reach to rearrange coal) and i don't want to taste mint when i order grape... I also don't want to sit in an uncomfortable table and see 3 open corners just cause I didn't meet the minimum requirement of how many people need to be in my group just to sit there. 

note: the staff really tried and was very friendly.
