I have not eaten at a KFC in quite some time and don't know that I will be back anytime soon.  This location was VERY hot! It appeared the air conditioning was not on nor working properly.  There were flies flying all around and all of the tables looked like they had not been cleaned all day.  While the people who were working seemed nice, I had to ask for napkins, a straw, and ketchup because they weren't anywhere to be seen.   I know KFC is a fast food restaurant but I expected it to be cleaner than it was!
