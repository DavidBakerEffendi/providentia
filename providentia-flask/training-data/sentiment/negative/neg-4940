Swiss chalet used to be good. Went in to give it another try cause my buddy didnt want to spend lots at magic spot. Tried the 2 can dine for 15 which is a stupid price if theyre gonna be serving what i recieved. Chicken was horrible tasting, no flavour, my ceasar was disguisting. Tipped my waited 20% because he actually looked after us, feel bad for him to serve such shitty food. Grab some new chefs ya bozos.
