I love to support local business but CR needs some improvement. 2nd time here. Very slow service this time. Family kids help which can be good and bad. My wife got beef with her order. She can't eat beef. When we asked if it was pork they said yes. Well it was beef and now she is sick. Oh well. When they are full they can't handle the volume. Nice family but hire some help for peak times and when someone asks what is on their plate know what you are serving.  We won't return.
