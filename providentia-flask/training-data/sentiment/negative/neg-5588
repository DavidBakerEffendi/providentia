We attended an event which was promoted as "Beat the Heat -- Arizona Winterfest" at The Venue Scottsdale today. First off, let me suggest to other promoters that before they commit to a venue for their affair, they should check Yelp reviews. I hope my review turns some future promotors off this location It was, in one word, a disaster.

The idea for the event was a good one. Have a bunch of microbreweries organized to offer their wares in a nice, cool "Wnterfest" environment. Instead, because of inept management at The Venue and nothing else, it turned out to be "A Day in Hell" for anyone who attended. It was --quite literally -- between 95 and 100 degrees inside the hall. Everyone was mopping their head and wondering, "How did I get into this mess?" Really, where would you go in Phoenix in the summer to be in outside temperatures while inside a hall event? Who would put people through such an agonizing episode? 

Because of the heat, people were affected more than normally by the alcohol. The Scottsdale police showed up, wondering why there were so many people getting physically sick. While people were inside trying to get a few beers to pay for their $25 investment, each of them anxious to get out and find some aircon, a fresh batch of suckers would be lined up outside, standing in the sun and waiting to get inside. I guess the promotor could be laughing all the way to the bank? If management had simply cranked the AC down all night long to prepare for this, it could have been salvaged. If you are considering The Venue for any kind of event in our hot months, literally six months of the  year, you ought to reconsider. The place is looking a bit shabby on the inside, there is no air conditioning to speak of, and there's a great shortage of restrooms. Think twice -- this place is a dump.
