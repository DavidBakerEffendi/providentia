ordered seafood tofu mixed hotpot. mostly tofu with 2 tiny shrimps, 1 mussel and 1 finger nails size oyster.....complained to the server, and she bought back the pot to the kitchen; but later she bought back the same pot with added one tiny piece of oyster. definitely not worth the money. won't recommend and go back again. 
this place won't last long for such business
