Whoever manages this location runs one damn loose ship. I just walked in and wanted to order food only to be greeted by teenagers who just stared at me like a Martian with their hands in trash bags. I asked them if they were closing thinking there must be a reason for the very odd atmosphere...no response. What the hell did I just experience?
