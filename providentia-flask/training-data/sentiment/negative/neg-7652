I love a good sandwich and have certainly been to my fair share of them in my day. I have heard about Which Which for a few years now so when I saw this one had opened we made plans to check it out for lunch today. I ordered the Roast Beef, my wife order the vegetarian, and my sons order the ham and cheese and the buffalo chicken Sandiwch. None of us were very impressed and my son quickly pointed out that the bacon on his sandwich was "bacon bits" instead of strips of bacon. Minus 1 star for inferior quality. Each of my kids ordered milk shakes and the 2nd one literally took 14 minutes to be made!  Outrageous in my opinion unless your churning ice cream for each shake people!!!  Minus 1 star for slow service. 

Now, as I'm waiting for the shakes to come up the kid calling out the sandwiches says "French Dip for No name". I chuckled because obviously the person filling out the bag didn't give a name. Well, the manager obviously didn't find it funny and scolded him for it launching a back and forth about the lack of training he was given. Minus 1 star for the manager and minus 1 more for arguing in front of customers. 

All in all it was not a good experience. Definitely wont be back and with all of the other choices in Grayhawk I suggest the owners get their act together or this location will close before the next milkshake gets made.
