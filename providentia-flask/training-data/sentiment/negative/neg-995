I am giving one star because I have to. Restaurant is busy, it is a Saturday morning, but it's not slammed. I  am here with my two young daughters that are starving. We waited 30 minutes for pancakes and eggs. We didn't have a waitress take our order, I actually believe it was a manager. I watched people get sat and fed before we received our food. Our food finally came and it was obvious that it sat under a heat lamp. The eggs were cold and my sausage was hard. Irritated doesn't even explain how I feel. The girls did eat their pancakes, but the top pancake was hard from sitting under the heat lamp. If I didn't think they would have melted down, I would have returned theirs as well.
