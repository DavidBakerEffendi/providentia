How bout no. After a long day of travel and work I just wanted a deep fried onion and cold beer. Maybe catch a few innings of a ball game in the bar. Sat in bar...waited in bar. Nothing. Starving, I went to the hostess and said maybe I should sit at a table, as I was hungry. Sat at table...nothing. Traveling for work, I typically enjoy Outbacks for consistent food, drink and service. Not so much this one.
