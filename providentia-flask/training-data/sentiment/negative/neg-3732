Good service but did not enjoy the food. We had steak and eggs (steak was not tasty) and ricotta pancakes (which were edible but bland). Cute ambiance. Based on the other 1000 reviews, seems like we may have come on an off day. Nevertheless, we are unlikely to try this place again.. there's way better food in Vegas.
