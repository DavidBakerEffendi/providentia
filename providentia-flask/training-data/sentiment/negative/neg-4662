This place is overrated in so many ways. Yes, they have a sushi lunch buffet but people only go to it because it's so cheap. Paying for a $12 sushi lunch buffet is not gonna stop you from taking a trip to the restroom after. Yeah... No thanks, I'll pass. 

Sushi is pretty bad. Lol I'm not even gonna sugar coat anything. The quality of the fish is not even close to being fresh.. So if you're looking for some good sashimi, skip out on this place. 

Basically, I'm no sushi expert but lets just say most of these awesome 5 star reviews are from people who only knows how to eat California Rolls or Chinese food. 

Service is like a 2 out of 5. They're nice but they always make me feel rushed. Like... Please! I just sat down, I haven't even read the front page of the menu yet!! I just need some time to read this book of a menu!!!
