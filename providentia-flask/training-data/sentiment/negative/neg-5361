Don't go for lunch specials unless you want microwaved leftover quality.
So sad since this place used to be a family favorite. 
While there another family complained HAIR IN FOOD EEECH.
Remodeled some time recently but the smell was still the same. Do they ever clean their restrooms?
Service??? Non existent but to be expected as long as the food is good. 
Well I can say that has gone by wayside as well. 
Ordered the COD IN TOMATO SAUCE  got COD doused in sweet and sour. Similar but Not the same thing.
Duck was dry and shriveled made me want to cry. For a place famous for barbecue I was left with an underwhelming sense.
Please folks you have been forewarned of this location. Instead go across the street to Thai Noodle House where the food is cheaper, tastier and most importantly cleaner

Went back with friends 6.01.15 even after my initial warning.
Sad to say that they did not take my harsh review to heart.....
Still stinky restroom 
All around bad service...and the food was sub par....
Perhaps to some this place is worth the risk...but compared to the other Sam Woo's and the other great businesses in the area...JUST TAKE A PASS.....
