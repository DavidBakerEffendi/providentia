So I feel that it's safe to say I give up on Rosatis pizza at Dobson & the 202( Riverview). On two different occasions I've called & we've waited up to 2 hours for our pizza. Another time, the food came cold. For that, I received a $25.00 credit ( which I actually forgot that we had). I decided to give it another shot(after several months) & that pizza, surprisingly, was delivered ok. However, this time, after 45 minutes, this is what was delivered to our door! What the hell is this?! Either they don't know how to place the pizza in a box properly or Mario Andretti was the delivery driver! I called, understandably upset, & was assured by the Manager, Chris, that I would get a new complete order within 30 minutes or less. An hour later, the pizza finally arrives( only the pizza, not the complete order)greasy & the cheese looks like it was placed on the crust. I called the manager again only to be held on hold for 10 minutes to which I was told it was very busy & to call back in an hour or two. I have officially given up on this place! It's shit & the pizza has become shit!

What's even funnier, I was told by the delivery driver who delivered the redo pizza that "this has NEVER happened before", meanwhile a post from 22 days ago shows a pizza that showed up in worst condition that ours did! This place is a joke!
