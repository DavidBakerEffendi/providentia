Sandbagged burgers. Not necessary being the burgers are small for fast cooking. Asked for well done crispy fries.. comes out same regular. White guy who took our order couldn't even put a fresh patty down, don't know the difference from crispy and regular fries. Only came here cause my daughters choice. Definitely talking her out of this place next time...
