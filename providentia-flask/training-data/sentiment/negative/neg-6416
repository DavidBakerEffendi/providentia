I had been here once before and it was so so.  My wife and I went for lunch on a sat afternoon.  We both ordered cheeseburgers one order of fries and one drink.  The tab $25.00.    The burgers were huge.  They were so big it was difficult to bite into them.  Also everything kept falling out.  After a few bites half of the ingredients were off the burger.  Eventually I just ate the meat and threw everything else away.  A nice large bun like Fuddruckers might solve the problem.    The fries were very good.  Now the cleanliness.....i get why some places offer peanuts so people can throw the shells on the floor and it won't look "dirty."  However when food and napkins are intermixed with peanut shells it is still dirty.  PLUS there was an employee wiping off the tables and chairs and all he did was wipe everything the floor.  I don't think we'll be going back ever.
