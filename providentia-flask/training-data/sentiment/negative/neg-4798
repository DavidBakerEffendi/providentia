This place has decent food. The prices are high as to be expected with hotel restaurants. The biggest issue I have is their service. It took forever for them to get my water, and I was one of two people in the restaurant. The staff stayed busy with cleaning the place instead of paying attention to us. Really disappointed with the service.
