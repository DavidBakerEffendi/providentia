This company does not seek improvement. 
First time I ordered takeout from the Richmond Hill location a while back and it was bad enough. Fish dried out, rice too soft. We literally threw the order away after a few bites.
 But a couple of my friends recommended the 16th/markham road location so thought we would give it a second try. We ordered the 100pieces sashimi/sushi/roll combo plus 2 side orders or Hamachi sashimi. Hamachi as a side ordered was like below average the all-you-can eat quality. Again rice was still too soft and mushy (though not like babyfood rice like the first time ordered, I guess that is an improvement). Note that upon ordering I had mentioned to the lady on the phone that please make sure the rice is not too soft as that was what happened before. 
I am guessing if you know the owners you would get better food but as a random customer no need to bother with this place.
