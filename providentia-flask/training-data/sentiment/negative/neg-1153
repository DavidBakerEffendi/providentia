Super unhappy, and I didn't even eat! The lady made up EVERY excuse not to honor the restaurants.com voucher I printed out just yesterday. First she said business was too slow to honor it. Then she said it was from 2011? Then she said it was only for catering orders of 60.00 or more. Then she said it was fake. She never called to confirm, she didn't even look at it to see where it was certified, or that it said 10.00 off 20.00 or more. I refuse to do business with people that refuse to honor their promotion. They should take themselves off restaurants.com if that's the case. booooo!
