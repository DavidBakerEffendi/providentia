Ok so here was my order.

1 large pizza three toppings
1 cheesy bread with marinara dipping sauce
2 garlic sauces 


Absolutely terrible service here! Pizza came cold. And was over cooked. Order was wrong not once but twice. They forgot the marinara. Best part was when I called in and told them the error they promised to have a new one out in a bit which was another hour. It came ice cold and once again they delivered to me (after I called in and numerous times explained why I need the marinara sauce) two garlic sauces. It's frustrating knowing the person they hired to take orders has no idea how to listen. Honestly will not ever order from this dominos again. Too hard to get what I want and there's zero quality control I guess.  

Try calling another dominos if you need some good food.
