Grew up on  this pizza! It's a hit or miss with their pizzas now. The crust is either fallen flat or the sauce is bland or too sweet. I wish that a Great Pizza place would come to North Akron, that would make the local pizza shops step up their quality. Seems they have made enough money to gut their kitchen, because it is outdated and grudgy. My daughter won't eat their pizza because the staff needs to look cleaner(dirty aprons) (dingy walls and floors) this place is existing on a reputation established 50 years ago, but they don't have the standards and I don't think they care about their clientele being satisfied. The other emidios in Cuy. Falls is newer, cleaner and puts out a much better product. North hill's customers are African Amer. And blue collar White Amer.  We deserve consistent, great product. They should show respect and put out a consistently good food product.
