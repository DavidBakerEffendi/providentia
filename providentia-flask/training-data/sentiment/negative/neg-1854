I ordered two Shawarma pitas to go and a Cilantro Jalape√±o Hummus. I opened up the pita for the hummus and the pita had mold all over it. Our pita bread on our Shawarma pitas was stale and the chicken was dry. I use to love this place! What happened? I've been a loyal customer of Pita Jungle for 16 years.  I will not be going back to this location.
