Had to re-cook the under cooked dumplings.

Ordered Chinese broccoli dish and got a plate of mushrooms and was told that's how it comes at Chinese food places.

Not worth the $50 dollars, not worth $10 dollars. Want a great dumpling house, try the one on Spadina, the same one these people are trying to duplicate but have failed so miserably at.
