If I could give this 0 stars I would.
Delivery took an hour. Pizza arrived cold and not prepared as ordered. Sausage is completely unseasoned pork topping.  Gross is the only word I can think of to describe this pizza. Save your money. You'll get better pizza from the frozen food aisle at Giant Eagle.
