I'm shocked that there have been favorable reviews on this place. The gentleman who has presented himself as the owner, was nice but not very well put together. Poorly served food, so-so service, dirty tables as well as a bathroom without toilet paper. The girlfriend of the owner was wonderful and did an excellent job explaining the menu. We've been here 2 times - we wanted to like it given that it's in our neighborhood but it's horrible. The food was also very bland & served cold. I'll give them 3 stars for their chips but less than a star on the rest.
