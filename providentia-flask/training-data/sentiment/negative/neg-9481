I was really excited to try this place out. Ordered a large cheese steak for myself and my husband. While eating it, I kept biting into something crunchy. I kept spitting out burnt crispy, over cooked bits from the grill that was mixed into my sandwich. 

Not the best way to experience a sandwich that is suppose to be "the best in America" most definitely was a turnoff and yummy turning to bite into this nasty crispy whatever when I was hoping for delicious. Really disappointed. I thought I found a new place to but instead found a place to stay away from. 

Such a pity. $22 for a sandwich and a chip drink combo to be this. Not happy, feeling like the staff doesn't care about the quality of food served. Yuk!
