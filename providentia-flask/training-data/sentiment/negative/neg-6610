Let me start by saying this is not a one-off review.  I have been going to this place for years and it was very good. (Not the best, but good). 
This morning my wife and I took a trip over for my fav menu item. Machaca breakfast burrito with potato.  I've had this many times in the past but OMG!  I could not even finish it.  It tasted like old used fryer grease and did not even have an egg in it.  How do you call it breakfast without an egg?   Just mushy mashed potatoes with a tiny bit of hamburger in it.  (Yes burger. Not even real roast beef)  Worse yet the portion size had reduced to 1/3its normal size (barely 3 bites of filling) and was still wrapped in the usual giant tortilla.  Anyone that has been here before knows how good those are.  Er... Used to be.  The tortilla had the same used grease taste as the rest.  My wife had the chicken taco and even it had suffered major changes and used grease taste.  (How do you mess up a taco?)
 I am so sad and will be reluctant to return anytime soon 
Beware, this place may be on the way out.
