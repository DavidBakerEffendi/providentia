I ordered a pizza for my children but never received it.  After sitting for 30 minutes, I went to the counter to return the table marker and explained the situation to the lady at the counter.  She said that the zero was not on the ticket. (My table maker was 40 and the ticket was for order #4).  No concern or care after I told that I didn't want the pizza anymore.
