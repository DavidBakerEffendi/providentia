I am so sorry to leave this review but I  have to be honest...El Pollo Loco has nothing to worry about, the concept is cool the employees really try to please but unfortunately the chicken is a waste of time.....no flavor what do ever, I think that they are depending on the charcoal smoke to flavor the Chicken..NOT!!!! they have to usr some type of seasoning, the entire meal was just bland.....I can not recommend this establishment.   SORRY!!!
