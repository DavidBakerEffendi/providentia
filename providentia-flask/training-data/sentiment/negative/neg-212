Not family friendly. The owner gave us grief when we brought our stroller in and asked for us to leave it when there was plenty of room in the restaurant as it had just opened up and there were no customers. We would have been more than happy to leave it outside or at the front of the restaurant if it was a small restaurant or blocking anyone, but this was not the case. We were the ONLY ONES at the restaurant.
