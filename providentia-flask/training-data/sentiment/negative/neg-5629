I normally have a good experience at this Denny's the handful of times I've been there; however, I am so upset almost to tears over our breakfast experience this morning. Our server Dillon was apparently very off put by the fact that he'd be serving me and my three kids that he has mind up up from the start. I literally have never felt bullied by a server the way this person made my (perfectly respectful) children and I feel.  I was told "no, I'm too busy for that" when I asked him to clear a few empty glasses, as well as MANY other extremely rude comments made under his breath and while walking away. The straw that broke the camels back was when he handed me some napkins (I didn't ask for them but he found time) and said "you're welcome to leave as soon as you're finished eating" As a nurse, I understand that serving people can be difficult at times, but this guy needs to find a new line of work...my six year old was even shocked!! By the time I had finally had enough and asked for the manager, Jennifer and fully explained the situation to her she was mortified as well. She told me she would talk to him and ask him to come out and apologize for his rudeness. I waited for Dillons return, which never came and when Jennifer returned I asked her if he was refusing to apologize to me to which she replied that he was. She was going to be reporting his insubordination to the GM, Michael Frohling. I will be following up with him as well, since I am absolutely mortified by his behavior.  Go be a woman hater somewhere else buddy...Denny's ain't your gig! If you go to this Denny's on a Sunday morning beware of Dillon!
