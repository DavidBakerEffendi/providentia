If I could do less than one star I would.


My ordeal with these people started Super Bowl Sunday 2012. Pick the coin flip and win a free pizza. Nothing to lose right? My wife and I chose heads, America chose heads, it was heads in the game, everyone wins a free pizza. 

Generally we only order pizza from mom and pop joints as they are better quality, taste and seriously the chains are just terrible, but this price was right.

Move ahead two weeks and we order the free pizza. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. 90 minutes later we get the pizza, nasty and cold. 

A week later, in an effort to right their marketing wrong Papa Johns offers us a free pizza, two liter, and free side of our choice. We order and wait. And Wait. And wait. An hour after they were supposed to show they finally get here. Pizza is cold and nasty. And they forget the side. I realize $8 per hour doesn't exactly inspire the best work or get the best employees but when I called in the guy on the phone was rude and extremely unhelpful. No doubt he was used to fielding calls from angry customers. 

The bottom line here is that this is terrible pizza, with even worse service and delivery. We didn't pay a dime (except for $2 delivery fee...twice) and we still feel like we got screwed. With so many other places to go to get your pie, save yourself the headache and wait of this dump. They should be out of business and hopefully will be soon.
