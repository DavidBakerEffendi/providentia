Zero stars just based on the absolute lack of customer service from THE OWNER. For the food maybe 1 star at most. On recommendations, came in for brunch...ordering sweet and salty asked for the chorizo hash and the berry french toast...waitress comes back in a few with the news "out of chorizo"..ok, move on to the prime rib hash with cheese on the well scrambled eggs. Food comes out...no cheese...no flavor to the hash, and the french toast is hard as a rock. Doesn't cut with a knife on half the dish...cracks when you hit it. Also...no flavor. Chef comes out...how is everything? Advise no cheese on my eggs as ordered. Before we can go on to address issues with all food, he goes back to bring more eggs...which are runny as hell. Proceeds to argue with us about our impression of the food. Sorry dude...admit you had an off morning and go on with life. Don't berate us in front of your other customers and use "feeding your family" as an excuse to treat your customers like crap. Who, by the way, are the ones that make it possible to feed your family!
Paid for the coffee (which was also crap) and tipped the waitress. Telling everyone we meet to save your time, money and taste buds, and stay away from Served. Go where the owner recommends...Kitchen Table...guess we'll go there now since we're still hungry.
