I try to stick to the old "If I have nothing nice to say then say nothing at all" rule. But I just can't hold my tongue any more about this place.  I have given it way too many chances and it keeps failing me over and over. I want to like it because it is so close to my house, but they make it so hard! The service is atrocious. 

I will not get into all the horror stories I have about this place, but I will share the most recent one. The straw that broke the camels back, NYE! Las Vegas has endless options for New Years celebrations and we had a hard time choosing. Finally we saw an ad for Silverton and it said $10 open bar at all casinos bars from 9pm-1am. Now at this point we have already sworn off Silverton and are sick of their 'Bait & Switch' marketing techniques, but how could they possibly screw this up? Going into it we knew they will be understaffed on bartenders and they will be grumpy, but we were somehow okay with that part. We talked all of our friends into this thinking how bad could it be?? BAD! They only had ONE WELL OPEN for the open bar. 5 bartenders standing around doing nothing and one moving at snails pace at the only 'approved area' for open bar. This is NOT an open bar. This is a soup kitchen line 30 people deep for a sample cup of domestic beer.

Oh Silverton you have fooled me for the last time. I put up with your home made sportsbook and the worst bartender services i've ever seen, but this is too much. I will never go here again. I'll wait till it goes out of business and PTs or Station Casinos reopens it as something good.
