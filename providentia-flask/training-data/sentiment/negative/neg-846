Decided to meet my boyfriend here for dinner after work on a Monday at 6:30. There were only two other occupied tables which was probably a red flag. There was no air conditioning and it was stuffy and very uncomfortable. Our server brought us water right away and that's where the decent service ended. We ordered our meals but our server did not write down anything. I ordered chicken and shrimp pad thai with a spice level of 1 and my boyfriend ordered a broccoli and shrimp thing with a spice level of 7. (I was planning to order soup but it was so damn warm in the restaurant that soup seemed like a ridiculous idea.) When the food arrived, my boyfriend's order was completely wrong. He was given chicken with ZERO spice. I mean, it was bland. Because the server hadn't written down our orders, she obviously couldn't reference anything when my boyfriend told her that his order was wrong. The chicken was weirdly flattened and VERY dry, to the point of being inedible. The handful of shrimp on my pad thai was rubbery and overly fishy tasting. My pad thai was weird and sticky. No cilantro. No lime. The server did not charge us for my boyfriend's meal, which we appreciated. Even though this place is literally five minutes from my house, we will not be going back.
