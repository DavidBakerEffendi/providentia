While not an expert at running a food establishment , I can tell that serving customers a bunch of frozen vegetables is not a good idea. In addition to frozen veggies this store is famous for not washing their hands and using the same gloves after they take money. The manager doesn't seem to have a clue how to run her store and laughed when I told her how dangerous serving frozen vegetables and not washing hands was. No washroom at this location either. I hope subway head office catches them off guard and teaches them a lesson is cleanliness and customer service.
