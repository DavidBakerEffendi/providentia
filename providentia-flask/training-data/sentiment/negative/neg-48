Unfortunate that this company gets 5 stars. When I called in mid-november for an order for early December I was met with resistance to my request because they had so many corporate and holiday orders. So I said okay I understand I'll take chocolate and vanilla cupcakes but I like them with the reverse icing on them please. It seemed that they felt they were able to accommodate at least this simple minimal request. When we arrived to pick up the cupcakes they didn't even have them made. They said no there's no order for that!  And then it turns out yes there was and then they rushed to make them within a couple of hours . It is very obvious by seeing the cupcakes how rushed they were. What I received was a mess of cupcakes and a box unsupported (see picture), and a large flimsy box for my 3 dozen cupcakes that were very sloppily done - again, see photos. There are many other companies out there I would avoid this one if you really something that is aesthetically pleasing and taste good. Don't waste your money.
