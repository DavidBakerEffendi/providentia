Ummmm I usually don't Yelp cafe rios because it's just an easy food place and there's really no problem (I've worked at fast food chains so I know there will always be minimal mistakes made here and there but it never matters? Cuz you just get your food and go lol) but this location um wow. They're taking orders like criss cross. The person taking my order is the person infront of the person behind me in line. And the one who should be taking my order is talking to the person behind me and behind that person in line. Lol this sounds confusing, but imagine it actually happening. Even more confusing in person! 

They literally keep messing up and they look at you like you're stupid if you tell them what they missed. Hopefully they train their employees to be more organized.
