BLAH!!!  Margaritas served in a small martini style glass, soooooooo full of ice that it is about 3 sips and it's gone. Nachos served in the chip container with a "splash of cheese" on top and pico de gallo the rest was dry as SH*T. The chips were wet from the pico de gallo they put all over the top. Yuck!  The only thing that is normal is the beer. Save your money.
