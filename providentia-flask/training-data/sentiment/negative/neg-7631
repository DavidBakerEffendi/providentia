This has always been our favorite restaurant! Went on Friday and sat outside waiting for a table. Never mind the wait for their great food, but the smell of sewage outside was so bad that, by the time we got a table, I was terribly nauseous. Our clothes smelled of sewage. Felt bad for the waitress because we ordered drinks and had to take the check and leave. 

Don't know if we can go back which is really upsetting.
