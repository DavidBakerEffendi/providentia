This place is a rip off!  The front desk told us the Suite was lowered to a Special Rate of $250, a bit more than the room we had booked in advance, but much bigger.  When I get the credit card bill, there is a charge for over $400 for the room.  

I contacted the Hotel and they informed me that the $250 was an "upgrade" fee on top of what we had paid for the original room.  When I explained to the Manager what the person at the front desk had told us, his response was...well that was verbal and it cannot be verified.  They were not willing to reduce the rate to $250.

The room was ok, but def not worth $400+, especially not with the horrible stinch of cigarettes in the room!

We would never stay in this Hotel again and don't recommend it to anyone.
