My boyfriend and I ordered take out a few nights ago and got Calamari tempura roll, vegas roll, California roll, tootsie roll and fried rice and when we opened it at home we didn't have our vegas rolls and the rice was extremely cold and crunchy. And we only live 3 minutes away so that's is not why our rice was cold. It was my first time ever eating there and I am highly disappointed  because I LOVE sushi and this place is so close to where I live. The sushi we did get was amazing. Just wish we had gotten our entire order and better rice.
