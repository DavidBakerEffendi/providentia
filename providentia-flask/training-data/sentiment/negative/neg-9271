I would not recommend this place if you want good food. If you are looking for a place to just hang with your friends this might be a good drinking place but do not come for the food. 
To be honest, I'm not quite sure what people are raving about but maybe it's people that haven't had much experience with good Korean/Jap or Asian fusion food. Most of the things on their menu are deep fried. Let's go item by item:
- the pork belly was nothing as we had expected. Instead of real chunks of meat, we got a diced up meatball deep fried in a hard ball. The food itself isn't tasty either and just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. 
- the avocado slaw had two pieces of avocado in it...lets just leave it at that. 
- the fried rice was average at best. Honestly i can make much better fried rice. 
- the squash pouting was a nice surprise. Good mixture of flavours. 
- just as we thought things were on the upswing, the final dish came- Buffalo tofu. This was the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth, and I've been stung by a wasp on my tongue before. The crust was hard like a rock, and the tofu inside had a texture close to wet sand. My girlfriend couldn't even finish her piece. The girls next to our table didn't even bother with theirs either. 

Bad choice!
