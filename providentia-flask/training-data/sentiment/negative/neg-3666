We stumbled upon Limon late at night and decided to check it out on a whim. We regretted it. Limon is overpriced, too noisy, too pretentious and has no idea what good and fresh food is. Also, they have giant car and wine ads inside their menu which is the weirdest thing I have ever seen at a restaurant. I guess selling out their integrity as restauranteurs wasn't too difficult.

On to the food.. the entree we had, the guacamole dip with nachos. The guacamole has no spiciness to it whatsoever, so while the taste is acceptable it definitely lacks in depth.

The fajitas... for $15 I expected something more than what an El Paso Fajitas kit could give me on a tuesday night after work. The flavors were really bland and the ingredients sorely under seasoned. The vegetables and condiments tasted like water and the chilli sauce (which the waitress forgot to bring us at first) had no bite to it whatsoever and once again no depth to it.

We spent most of the meal joking around about how bad the place was and how they have to pump "bar music" really loudly so that their customers might forget how they are being screwed and how their food tastes like Uncle Bob's Very Forgettable  Taco Night.
