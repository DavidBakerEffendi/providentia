I have never been here for their tapas, although heard it is good. Actually went there today for their Mother's Day Brunch. Oh man. Gross. They don't know how to treat a mom! It was like they went to Costco and bought a bunch of salty meat, cheese, and starchy sides in bulk and threw it together on a buffet. Their website indicates they would have an omelet bar (which was scrambled eggs) and a dessert bar (which was 2 different types of danishes). 

The selection was lousy and small. I don't love meat but I tried their turkey which was fair. I tried their mixed greens, also fair. And their sauteed vegetables which was carrots, red pepper, onion and celery. Really??! They couldn't throw in a brussel sprout or broccoli or something? Two veggie selections and no fish. 
 

If you're all about the meat and potato guy, I'm sure it made dad happy but even my husband  thought the food was below mediocre. We paid 39.99 per adult which seems overpaying for something that didn't look like it required a lot of effort. 

Forget ending on a sweet note. Dessert was like some sort of pastry you could buy in a box at Costco. Store bought Entemann's danish?? Anyone? No chocolate, no nothing. I wouldn't exactly call it a "dessert bar". 

It's not really fair to give a one star review when I have never tried their tapas but I wouldn't recommend going there for Mother's Day Brunch and I was so turned off by this experience, not sure I'd give it another try.
