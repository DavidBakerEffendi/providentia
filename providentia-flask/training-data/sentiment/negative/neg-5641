We will never be coming back to Margaritas again. It took about 15 minutes for our server to get our drink order and another 15 minutes to recieve our drinks (4 well margaritas). I also asked for a side of beans and rice while we ordered drinks and those came out 15 after our drinks. I'm not sure why any restaurant would take that long for a side dish to be served. After an hour we finally received our dinner (2 entrees and an order of nachos). 
Our server was nice but overall, the wait for anything was obsurd. 
When they said they were understaffed I asked if they anticipated the festival that was happening a block away and they said they didn't which makes for a horrible management.
