Grabbed some food here since I was craving Papa Chang stuff but didn't want to go the distance. The food here is so far behind in quality compared to Papa Chang at Markham Road. 

They had probably the worst popcorn chicken I ever had recalled. It's hard to even start. It had some cartilage mixed in and overall it tasted horrid. I only ate a few pieces and just buffered it with rice because I was hungry.

This branch didn't even have the deep fried pork belly. Though I am afraid on how they would F it up considering how badly they F'ed up the popcorn chicken. 

I didn't even bother trying out the lurofan. Because if you saw it, it was a just a couple of spoonfuls of meat over a disproportionate amount of rice. 

Never going to go there again. Might as well go for Chung King takeout.  Or go the distance and head over to 16th and Markham Road to get the proper one.
