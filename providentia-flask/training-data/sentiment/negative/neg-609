I have been a loyal customer for 25 years.  We had breakfast at the Sky Harbor location on Sunday March 19th about 8 am..  The person that took our order was an African American man who was beyond rude and seemed to resent taking our order and waiting on us.  He mumbled questions about what sides we wanted with our order and when we asked him to repeat it he got a major bad attitude and snarled his answers.  We should of cancelled our order of over $30 right then and there and gone somewhere else.  Every time we asked for something, like more syrup, etc.,  he was angry and nasty towards us.  These kind of people should not be in customer service because it gives your business a bad rep.   I do not know what his problem was but is was obvious he was in a very bad mood and decided to take it out on the customer.    I hope his boss reads this information.  Thanks, Sandy
