Terrible service, just terrible. Before our drinks even came there was a bird pooping onto our table but the staff couldn't care less (perhaps because we're an "ethnic" family). Both the wait staff, and someone, who I assume is the manager, were extremely rude and very unapologetic. Sure, they couldn't do anything about the bird, but they could have, at the very least, let us move the table slightly, to avoid unwanted filth falling directly into our food and drinks. After a long while of this absurdity, the staff (very reluctantly), moved us to another table (inside this time). By this point though, this place had completely ruined our mood, both by the staff's deliberate avoidance of our issues, and their continued insolence. As a party of 7, we ordered a variety of dishes. Again, the food was not only subpar, but actually unenjoyable. In fact, we all concluded that we had had substantially better food elsewhere. Overall, not going back. Somehow, their blatant ignorance of our concerns during the service, and the unapologetic 'gtfo' attitude towards us (and to no other patrons present there at the time) is quite evident of a very bigotedly racist attitude embodied in this rather unremarkable eatery. As a paying customer, it's disappointing to be treated as a 'lesser person' in this day and age.
