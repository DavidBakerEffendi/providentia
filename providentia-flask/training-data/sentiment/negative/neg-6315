Went to petes to try something different. Waited 20(about)minutes total, 5 for someone to answer the drive through and 15 for food. They had a staff of 6 people that night and we were the only customers so I don't understand why it would take so long for food.  When we finally got home we realized they had shorted us on food and sauce. We deemed it not worth the trip to get this corrected.
