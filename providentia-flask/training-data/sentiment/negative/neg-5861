HOW DARE ANYONE RATE THIS "RESTAURANT" HIGHER THAN A NEGATIVE 15 STARS!!!

Ab-so-lute fuckery.

My sisters and I went here one afternoon upon my sister's suggestion since it had such high reviews on Yelp. Mistake.

The place was empty except for the bartender sitting at a table outside, a waitress in flip flops, and some cook who looked to be about 19. 

No lights were on so the only light came from the windows - too bad it was raining outside so the whole restaurant was dark and grey. The floors were sticky and the furniture looked like second hand crap since it was so beat up. I don't know how a place with zero customers does so much damage to their 1992-era tables and chairs unless they were from a consignment restaurant supply store. The tile floors were cracked and the bar area had some Grecian columns going on. The whole ambiance was just outdated, mismatched, and dingy.

We were served filets of charcoal with a petroleum spread aka burnt pita bread with butter packets as an appetizer. I'm no Anthony Bourdain, but I tend to not enjoy things that taste like an ash tray.

Everything on the menu was Cheesecake Factory prices, which was just a joke considering the quality of the dining room. I ordered the caesar salad. Three words is all I will use to describe the flavor of my meal: Nail Polish Remover. 

The water tasted like it was poured at the source, the source being a porta-potty. It was gross and I only took two drinks - one to taste it and the other to wash down my acetone-glazed pieces of lettuce.

Basically, this place was a disaster and how they pay their rent is beyond me.
