Wouldn't go  back.
Went for the express lunch, and they were already out of the main.

Ordered the tomato burrata salad.
Tomatoes not in season, they were tasteless. 
I don't understand where the burrata was from, as the skin was tough and nasty. The curds weren't soft and oozy- they were like chunks of week old dry ricotta. 
There was honey drizzled on top- made no sense. It did not go with the balsamic reduction and 1 sprig of  basil.

Ambience and service was great, but I went for the food!
