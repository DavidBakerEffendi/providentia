Placed a take out order due to the high review. When I got home, the food was a disappointment. I ordered garlic pepper chicken spicy level 8. When I opened the take out box, there are measly 9 pieces of thinly shredded chicken breast. The sauce was watery. The chicken tasted bland but spicy. Spicy hot was the only thing you can taste on the chicken meat. The food was nothing similar to the picture on yelp. 
The curry was also bland and spicy. I like spicy food, don't get me wrong but spicy bland? Ewwww. The curry was also watery like as if it has been watered down. Isn't Panang curry supposed to be thick and rich? This is definitely the worst curry I have ever tasted. 
I will advise everyone to stay away from this establishment. This is a waste of my money. I threw everything out after merely tasting it. 
SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!
