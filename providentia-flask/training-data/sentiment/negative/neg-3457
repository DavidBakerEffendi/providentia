Stayed here almost 5 different times now. All times great until today. Was told I had to pay a $75 early check in fee. Which I have never paid before and I always check in early here on weekends. But they 'waived' it to $45 instead since I 'upgraded'...

I get to my room and there is still trash in the trash bin from the last guest, notepad with writing on it. 

Called front desk and all the offer is the maid to come up immediately. Pissed off.
