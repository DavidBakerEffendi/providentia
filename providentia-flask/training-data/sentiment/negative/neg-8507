Came here with friends after getting disappointed in a mexican restaurant. A friend had tried this place and was raving about the food so thought of trying it out. We ordered veggie and chicken burgers along with masala fries. When the orders arrived, the patty was overcooked to the point of being burnt. The buns were cold and were not at all toasted. The masala fries were good and thats why the one star. I really wanted to like the place but was utterly disappointed.
