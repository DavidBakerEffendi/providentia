Service was terrible. Granted it was a Friday night but knowing it will be busy you would expect the service to be on point. The waitress was sweet but could not provide any info about certain things on the menu. Sisig fries was a disappoint. A whole bunch of fries and barely sisig. Fries were dry and our waters wasn't servers after 25 mins. Turon, was another item is have to ad to the list of disappoint. Was not made properly. The music was way too loud and the smoke machine was terrible idea while people eat. I will not go here ever again.
