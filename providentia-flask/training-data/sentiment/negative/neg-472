My husband had food poisoning from this place! STAY AWAY FROM HERE

I'm from Brooklyn New York and let me tell you this is terrible place. My husband had a bagel with whitefish salad , which in Brooklyn is wonderful. Plus he ordered an egg cream soda. If you're from Brooklyn or New York You  would know what I'm speaking about. 
Not even  Two hours after he ate, he was so sick. I won't get into details. 
The whitefish salad was horrible, potato pancake was flavorless. 

The bagels were stale. They don't know how to make a chocolate egg cream at all. It should be removed from menu. Place was not very clean either. 
My Bialy which I was so looking forward too was SO Stale as well. 

If you've ever tasted a REAL  bagel or bialy, then you know. Otherwise this place should take the "New York " off their sign. It's no where near New York food!
A horrible meal that ruined my vacation with food poisoning.
