I had the chicken Parmesan footlong sub. It was dry wish I had got the pizza recent reviews rave about it. Staff and service is good. The chicken is frozen before the cook it. I will go back for the pizza. They also have a $4.00 lunch two slices of pizza and a can of soda. Pizza was awful should have went to metro for same price.
