I would never think of giving this five star let alone two. This place gets one star because went to the store a half hour before it closes, and the guy behind the counter is putting everything away for the night. I have been to this place late at night every time it's like that you can't get what you want because it's all ready put away. This wasn't just one time. I am done going to this place.
