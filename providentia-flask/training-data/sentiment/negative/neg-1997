This place has gone way downhill. For one, their LED screen menu wasn't working, so the girl had to describe to me what they had, and I just had to trust them on the prices. When we settled on something that sounded halfway like what I have gotten in the past, she described it as having a candy straw. When I got my item, a "shaved" ice with tamarindo, chamoy, and mango, the ice was so lightly saturated, it just tasted bland and watered down. And the ice wasn't even shaved! It was literally big square ice cube after ice cube. The contents didn't even come up to the edge of the cup, despite a domed lid and an almost $6 price tag. After sitting down, I realized I hadn't received my candy straw. When I went back and asked the same girl, she said a candy straw wasn't included and would be 75 cents extra. After she had initially said it was included. Forget that. I have gotten this supposedly same thing many times before, and it always came with the candy straw. Besides this being barely edible. This place used to be awesome. Won't be returning.
