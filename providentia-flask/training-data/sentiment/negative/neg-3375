Ok. Saw this place from" check please Arizona " 
So here I am with my mom for a early Mother's Day dinner. 
I have had lots of Indian food before both in big cities and small towns. Bill was not right but they fixed it very quick.  
Now let's talk about food. It was terrible terrible and terrible. If you do not believe. Go find it out by yourself. 
There are lots of other place for Indian food are much much better.
