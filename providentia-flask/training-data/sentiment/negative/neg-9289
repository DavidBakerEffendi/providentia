The food have the Worst quality. Fish is not fresh at all. The fish and the rice are even not combined together. And the rice is so warm. Slow service. Not worth the money. They don't serve as many kinds of food as other sushi all you can eat. We ordered 5 kinds of sushi, they only gave us 2 of them, and let us reordered after  30 mins. What they have are the good location and iPads. As I see they waste them.
