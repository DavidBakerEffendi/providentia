We popped in on, Saturday night, 9-14-18 at about 9:00pm. We knew they closed at 10:30 so we figured it would be just fine to get a large variety of entrees. We were wrong. The cooks were already cleaning up the kitchen. They were out almost of white rice, nearly out of fried rice and chow mein, so much so that they were rationing very small portions. As far as the entrees go.....it was orange chicken or nothing. Basically out of everything. They refused to cook anything further. The gal who dished up for us looked embarrassed and apologized. She literally asked us to call and complain so the store manager would find out in hopes of  "Maybe these guys will cook past 8:30pm if enough people complain." We'll never visit this location again.
