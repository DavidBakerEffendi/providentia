Honestly speaking this buffet is over rated! The food are ok nothing special.  I can pay less and have the same taste.  Over rated
Chinese food fried rice, vegetable chow mien nothing else.  Taco taste like cardboard.  The sushi are just left over standing for a long time sushi staff are keep on chatting to each without checking the quality of food at there stations.  Prime Ribb very very simple no taste,  kobi beef is hard as a rock.  Please do not expect anything special with this buffet.  Travel channel featured Bellagio the main reason I tried but I was disappointed.  Food is ok nothing special.  Paying $38.92 is not worth the price maybe $15.99 to $20.00 is reasonable.
Bellagio - do better next time because I will never eat there again.  Travel Channel I will email you as well.
Important:  Post a Sign!
Before you center the buffet there is no post sign saying limit your dinning experience to 2 hours.  Only after you pay and check your receipt about time limit.  And they expect you to pay $38.92 weekdays for 2 hours!  This is totally Crazy!
The main reason for a buffet is to eat and take your time and chat with your friends and loves one.  
My Proof my receipt!
