ZERO STARS!!! Horrible from the moment I walked in! Disrespectful staff!! No one there can great a customer. First of all I stood there while this young lady Evan walked past me not acknowledging me what so ever there was a Order she was taking out so I though okay that fine she is to busy to say " all be with you in a moment "  no it never ever came out of her mouth she continued to walk around me in front of me behind me not a word as if I was not there I had enough as she walked past me one last night I stopped her and asked are you going to acknowledge I am here . She said nothing kept walking waited a few moments she took my order finally . While checking out to sodas to a lady sitting I thought that was even more rude as I had just been waiting forever to even get her to notice me and get my order she starts another 50 cent soda transaction. I had a feeling she was going to tell the cooks something about my food. Sure enough after waiting a while for my dozen wings and potato skins . I get home to  cold nasty wings my potato skins where uncooked bacon not cooked just horrible very very disappointing as it just opened soooo much closer to me I was excited I am a long wongs fan for many many moons but this was not worth my hard earned money.  Will never go back I would rather drive 10 extra miles to the other one.
