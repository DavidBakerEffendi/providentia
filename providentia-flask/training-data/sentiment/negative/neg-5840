Waited more than an hour. Totally wasn't worth it. Without a doubt worst meal I've had this year. Extreme greasy burger. It smelled like it was cooked on a dirty grill. My burger smelled like it was grilled in bacon fat. Oil for fries hasn't been changed or cleaned in days. I can't wait to go home so I can throw up before I get sick. First and last time here. Took forever to get our check. Almost felt.like we were being held hostage.
