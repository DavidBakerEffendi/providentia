This place is only being kept alive by the Bianco hype.  Atmosphere was iffy - garage-sale kitchy furniture (my chair was so wobbly I mentioned it to the hostess - she said "its stronger that it looks") and stars buck table cast offs.  

Had the Seafood Stew which was not worth the price and was charged extra for bread.

The service was good - but don't want to go back.
