I was hungry for a hamburger and my husband suggested Bearden's.  YUCK !  The clam chowder soup was lukewarm at best.  The onion rings were greasy,tasteless and had to much batter on them.  Steakburger? - seriously, the meat was paper thin and had absolutly no taste .  Milkshakes were OK.  We eat out at least once a week and granted some places are better than others but this Bearden's was not worth the $30.00 we spent.
