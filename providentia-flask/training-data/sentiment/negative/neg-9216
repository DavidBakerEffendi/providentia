This location  would not switch the bread on a turkey sandwich to a tortilla for my 4 year old daughter who struggle with food sensory issues (not picky eating, food sensory...certain textures make her puke).Even though I ordered her meal as a turkey sandwich melted on a tortilla, they wouldn't make it because I was asking for a quesadilla- and they don't have quesadillas on their menu. They do serve tacos and other items that require tortillas so they were available in the kitchen. The manager on duty refused but was willing to call the district manager who confirmed they do not make changes to their menus, even for toddlers with feeding issues. 

I would spend your money else where. Like the Starbucks or the other breakfast place in the same parking lot.
