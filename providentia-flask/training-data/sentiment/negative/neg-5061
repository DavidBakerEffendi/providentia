I see why they are giving away food on Facebook now. This place used to be so good-not to mention super busy. We got there at about 5:00 on a Saturday, which in the past would've meant a wait. The place was a ghost town and that really should've told us all we needed to know. Sat straight away and were rushed to get wine. We didn't get a chance to look at what the menu offered since things had changed. The waitress suggested Bogle Essentials for a blend. I guess, there's three of us so a bottle. Nothing fancy right? $32 for that lovely variety. No wonder she pushed that right on us and didn't give us a chance at the menu options. That's our fault for falling for that trick. So for the food. It was just sad. The bruschetta used to be so good. Now it just tasted like straight from the jar premade crap. The chicken salad was clearly not made on site and lacked any flavor. There wasn't an ounce of care put into that board. They were bored with their board. So we tried the "Big Board" a delightful pleasure to feast your eyes on of meats, cheeses, nuts, olives....now if you had really small hands like someone it would look "Big." And again...a mixed bag of store bought junk. And by store we were not even treated to something from AJ's. Man...this place used to be so awesome.
