It's been a long time since I left a restaurant before the food I'd ordered arrived because it was taking too long.  We waited 45 minutes, after telling the waitress that we had a time consideration.  No food - had to be somewhere so we left.  During that time no one checked on us.  Apparently you're not an important customer unless you're drinking (we weren't).

The manager apologized but made no attempt to do anything when we said we had to leave.  Worst service I've had at a restaurant in a very long time.
