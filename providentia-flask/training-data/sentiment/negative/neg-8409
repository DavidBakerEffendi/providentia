I wished that my lunch with my daughter was better but it wasn't. First off just happen to look at the HH menu. The waitress said oh, we don't have the oysters  bc they didn't come in. UHH it was lunch. Ordered the "Prime Rib Sliders" & Bang Bang Lettuce Cups. This was leftovers from last night, dried out beef that was so over cooked & nooked...no joke ! The butter lettuce was wilted not even chilled at all shrimp was so overcooked & under spiced. Maybe the cook had a hangover like one other review. Never will be back. Way too many other great places in Chandler.
