Horrible experience!  As I waited for my food I noticed the waiter petting a dog. Without washing his hands, he proceeded to serve food, grab eating utensils, and take orders. After, he still kept petting the dog. I told the manager if she can tell him to wash his hands before bringing my food and she said she would. She also said that he was petting the dog because it was his friend's dog. That is not an excuse! She then approached him and I assume she told him; however, he still didn't wash his hands. I told the manager to please cancel my order and left. She was nice and gave us the coffee for free. 

I know some people would not be grossed out by this, but I was! 

Also, their seating arrangement in the back is awful. They have tables right by the restroom. So ,if someone takes a crap, u will be smelling it as you eat your food.

Instead, I walked 5 steps from there and ate Skinny Fats; cheaper, cleaner, and faster.
