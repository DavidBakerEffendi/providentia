I'd rather not give this place 1 star.. crazy employee talking on cell phone and playing.. I told her I was in a hurry and pls end her call. She laughed, everyone working there jumped in took her side. They said I was going to wait longer now. Purposely took forever. I ended up leaving. Don't go. Id rather eat ramen than deal with these hood rats.
