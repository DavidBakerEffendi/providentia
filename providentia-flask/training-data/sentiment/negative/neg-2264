I would rather eat spam than ever walk back into this establishment. To emphasize how bad the experience was I am a vegetarian and I'd rather eat spam. I stood there waiting to get sat for over 15 mins, once seated I was greeted by my waitress whom was rude & barely knew English. I proceeded to the buffet the food LOOK amazing but looks fooled me. Once I sat down I realized that the food was cold & hard. I sat in my seat picking at my food around my plate. The assistant manager must've noticed and walked over asking me what was wrong I didn't want to make a big deal about it because I didn't want to draw any attention but he walked away and minutes came back with a lady whom I will assume was the manager. She walked over with an attitude and accused me of not wanting to pay as though I didn't have $ or something. I felt so degraded I didn't want to argue so I paid even after I paid she had an attitude and told me that she'd take $1.00 off of food that I didn't even intake as though she was doing me a favor. While taking my payment her and the assistant manager spoke in their native language arguing back and forth. I believe the assistant manager was arguing on my behalf. Nevertheless I would never ever go back to that establishment ever again even if someone tried to drag me in there!!!
