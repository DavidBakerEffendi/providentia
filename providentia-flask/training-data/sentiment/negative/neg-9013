I was recommended this place through close family, so we were super excited to have our first experience with Ethiopian food!

When we arrive, on a chilly Saturday evening, Dukem was full. That's ok, that means it  must be good! So, we came in expecting to wait for some seats. As we  arrive, a curtain  greets us with a homely restaurant, filled with smells delicious exotic spices. We were immediately greeted by a the host, telling us there were no tables available, and that it would be a 30 minute wait. We were told we could not wait inside, and it was cold outside, so we decided to grab a business card and wait in our car. 

We waited, and gave Dukem a call, and was told to wait another 10 minutes for a table of 4. 10 minutes passed, and we called again from the car, expecting  them to have a table of 4 ready. The person on the line told us they simply gave away our tables, and it would be another 30 minute wait. Really?? We showed up, and was turned away, called to confirm, and our table was given away. 

We were cold and hungry, and was told to wait almost 1 hour to eat there, because they gave our tables away. 

Poor customer service, broken reservation systems, and simply disgusting attitude towards prospective customers. We haven't eaten here, but based on their treatment towards us, we won't even bother.
