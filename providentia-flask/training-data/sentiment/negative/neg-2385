Worst fajitas I've ever had, totally bland. Side of rice in a Dixie cup!! 18.00 to share the worst fajitas I've ever had. Zero flavor. My boyfriends brother got the meatloaf, it tasted just like how canned dog food smells. All bad. I didn't like Toby before, now i feel ripped off by him. Highway robbery! It doesn't get worse than sides in Dixie cups, it was similar to convalescent home food, for those on a salt free, spice free diet. this place is a ramshackle.
