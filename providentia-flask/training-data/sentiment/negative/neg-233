Bowling was fun but service for dinner after was horrible. I felt terrible for our server; we had a group of 13 and we were her first table ever. No joke!!  No one trained her and the manager who we could see in a lovely floral print moo moo, was more concerned about drinking coffee and chorteling with her co workers than helping the poor girl who waited on us. Our server should be promoted to manager and the manager fired!!  Felt so bad for her.
