This place is in dire need of a make over. I walked in and the smell reminding me of my grandmothers apartment. So did the decor. So far the place looks old and smells old. The service was great, and then the food starting coming. The chicken dry, the turkey wrapped in bacon was dry, the sausage was okay, then they brought old tri tip. We could not eat it. As they were cutting it, it looked grey, the taste was bad! 
I would never go back there and any reviews on here that say this place is amazing must be from the owners family. Save your money! Buy one Get one is a waste of your money. Nice people but they are not serving fresh food.
