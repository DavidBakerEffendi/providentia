This place is a joke anymore and they will never see me again. I'd say out of the last 5 visits here the steaks were overcooked 4 times including tonight. We ordered 1 sirloin & ribs, 2 forth worth ribeyes which they overcooked both   and 1 salmon. My sirloin even though it was medium rare tasted dry. The salmon was prepared accordingly and tasted good. 
The ribeyes were supposed to be medium and came out well. So upon 2 of us eating while the other 2 waited the replacement steaks finally came out after about 10 minutes. They were juicy pink this time but the amount of fat was ridiculous. (Picture included)
Obviously I was very unhappy with everything and the manager Ron initially said he'd take care of the meals. The bill came out full price and Ron basically told us oh well. That was until I intensified my voice and he took care of 1 meal. The waitress was sweet as pie and told us we were correct in what we did. It was also stated by another table that they work at Longhorne and there would never be a question upon our complaints and both meals comped because it's good business. In addition, the loaded mushrooms were doused in salt.
