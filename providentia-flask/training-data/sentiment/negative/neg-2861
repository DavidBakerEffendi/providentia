Literally just went through the drive through.these people want all this money to work a fast food joint but can't even count to 6 nor can they  put a sauce in a bag. I ordered a 6 piece chicken nugget...only got 5 and asked for a sweet and sour sauce and got NONE!....but they want more money..bring in the machines.
