Ordered two Daybreak sandwiches - one with sausage, one with bacon. In both cases, pictures speak louder than words (see pics). Wish I could say they tasted better than they look, but that would be lying and momma taught me better. Greasy, soggy, buns missing pieces, and odd taste to the eggs. Couldn't take more than one bite - ended up tossing. If this is their interpretation of farm-to-table, best they keep it at the farm.
