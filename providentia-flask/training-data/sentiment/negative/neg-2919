This is the place you should go if you like:

Management and wait staff who are rude to people with disabilities.

Managers who take no responsibility for their rude bartenders, poor service, and mediocre food quality.

Bar staff who are vocal about their disdain for large parties.

25 minute waits for drinks; 45 minute waits for salads; and 90 minute waits for mediocre, bland, and cold food.

Poorly staffed events.

Poor customer service. 

General incompetence.

Save your hard earned money and go to one of the many decent, moderately priced establishments in the area.  You'll get better service and food, and you'll still have some money in your pocket.
