I decided to try this place about a month ago because it's really close by and we just moved to the area, so we had some take out. This has to be the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The food was bland and dry, and not to mention a little pricey. I'd avoid this place ... there are other options for Mexican food that aren't too far away.
