I ordered over the phone 45 mins prior to them closing and the food I got didn't seem fresh like as it was the leftovers. Bad food quality, decent customer service, I had a hard time ordering over the phone because she and I had to repeat many things to each other. Overall was not happy with the food and the price for what I paid for
