One of the worst buffet we have been to. Maybe it's because we went in at a later time for lunch, regardless of the time they should have more of a variety of foods. With the few foods choices available  VERY few were edible entr√©es. My kids are not fussy with their food, but for my kids to comment " Souplantation is a fraction of the cost of here and they have more salads choices than here." 

You can't really go wrong with salads, but this buffet doesn't even have the basic starter choices. Total waste of money and Very disappointed.
