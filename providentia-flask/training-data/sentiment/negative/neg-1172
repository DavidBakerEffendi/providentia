Tried to enter the building from the parking lot entrance since it was raining. Only to find the doors locked and the hostesses just looking at us get wet. Finally one came over and informed us that they were not open for ten more minutes. When asked if we could come in and sit at the bar for a cocktail while we wait out the ten minutes. We were informed that we could not do that. 
So they lost two covers and since it would have been our first time. It will now never happen at all now.
