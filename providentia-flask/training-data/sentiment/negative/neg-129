I am so over this place! Three strikes and your out! Nothing has changed. The service was lousy, the food was lousy...lousy lousy lousy. I thought with the changes thing's would be different! Nope!  The worst Mexican/ Tex Mex ever!  :-(  The Howard Johnson's that used to be there served better food!
