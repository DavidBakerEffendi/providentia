This may be the worst take out I've had in Charlotte. Got a chicken ribs combo. The chicken was ok, just absolutely bland and devoid of flavor. The ribs on the other hand are the poorest excuse for pork I've EVER HAD! Though they are virtually devoid of meat, there's plenty of fat and grizzley to make up for it. So greasy, so so greasy. The plantains were dry and textural unappealing. The fries were still raw. I don't mean cold, I mean undercooked. Not sure what kind of cooks they have bit they failed French Fry 101. Overall the best and only good part of the meal was the sauce. So just skip the EXTREMELY subpar food and just get a bowl of sauce. Whoever represents this "restaurant" should be ashamed.
