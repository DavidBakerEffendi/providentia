Minus three stars. Went there because "they have cold air" instead of the delicious and cheaper dive down the road.  The staff was downright disrespectful all the way to the manager, who looked 18 years old. The service was very slow and made my tortillas over cooked, NOO guacamole! Just keep going ahead and have McDonald's, save yourself.
