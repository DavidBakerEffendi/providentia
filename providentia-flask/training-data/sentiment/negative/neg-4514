Lame and pathetic. 

I've been to the Dick's Last Resort in Chicago, so I was prepared for the antics and expected a good time. Unfortunately these employees are not witty, they are just rude and incompetant. 

We walked up and the hostess was having a conversation with another co-worker. We asked the people in front of us how long they had been waiting to be seated and they said at least five minutes. I got her attention for them and we were all seated at the same time. 

Our waiter took over ten minutes to get to our table and the place was nearly empty. He said "You ready to order or what." Seriously...is that what passes for clever here? So, we ordered and when he turned away we walked out and went to another restaurant.
