Whatever replaces N9NE cannot, and will not be the same. Unless Chef Barry is involved I am completely out of reasons to visit the Palms, barring the rare romantic date at Alize. No more are the lobster mashed potatoes of fame. No more are the decadent meals and silly yet lovable "purple glow" theme lighting. N9NE was one of the last unassuming, yet beyond decent steakhouse options within a 10 mile radius. 

Again, this closure, coupled with Ghostbar's closure, removes any reason I may have had for visiting the Palms. Enjoy what you have coming: obscurity at best, the murder of w Vegas greats at worst.
