I do not understand why this place has such good reviews. The food was ok but the service was absolutely  terrible. Tons of food just waited by the kitchen counter because no waiters/waitresses would pick them up and deliver them to the customers. By the time we got our food, it was completely cold. Oh and pay attention when you are waiting for your seats. Because they mess up the waiting list a lot. They like to do their friends favors by letting them have the tables first.
