REVIEW IS FOR CLAIM JUMPER. 

Absolutely terrible service. We waited forever for our server to take our food and even longer to get our food. Our server took forever to get us coffee and drink refills. 

My mom's order came out incorrect with cold food and the chicken tasted so bad that she left it. She ordered her potato w extra butter and instead it came out cold with sour cream. There was no use asking for it to be fixed because every request took about 10 minutes to be fulfilled. 

I drove in from out of state to celebrate both of my parent's birthdays and they chose this place. I told the hostess, the server and whom I believe to be the manager back in the kitchen that it was their birthdays. Not one single person said happy birthday to them as most restaurants do. 

I ordered chocolate cake to go and the box was delivered with STICKY chocolate fingerprints ALL over the box and I had to wipe it down and ask for a bag. 

The server did seem he was irritated that we asked to move tables at the very beginning. We were all VERY friendly to the server but even so it made not an ounce of difference. I could post the server and manager's name but hopefully this review will suffice in them getting their act together. But I won't find out because I will never return. 

Unfortunately it could not have been more disappointing experience and I certainly will never return. I ADVISE everyone to steer clear of this establishment.

Trust me. You will receive better service at McDonalds. 
And management please feel free to reach out for specifics.
