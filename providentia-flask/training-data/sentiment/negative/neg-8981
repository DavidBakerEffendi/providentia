I happen to come across this restaurant as I was driving down Durango.  I thought I'd decide to come in one day for lunch and so I did.  I don't know how anyone can give this place five or four stars, but I'm sorry, Pan Asian didn't do it for me.

I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai Lunch Special.  I wasn't impressed, I've had better at other Thai restaurants.  Service was a bit slow, took awhile to get my food and check.

Once I completed my meal and paid, owner asked told me..."Thanks for coming in, see you again tomorrow."  I haven't been back since.
