Ive read the past reviews n decided to eat here. I honestly had better chinese food than this. Had some pork hash n it was so fatty and oily. Also had shrimp with honey walnut and the shrimp was way over cooked. I also had beef broccoli and it was not fresh broccoli it was the frozen ones that u buy in the bag n the dish served only 5 broccoli. Lemon chicken was so thin should of been called thin slice lemon chicken. Portion size were very small and the food was overcooked. The only positive thing I can say was the water service; the server made sure our glass was full. My husband and I are very disappointed. Will not be returning. Maybe thats why we were the only customers in there.
