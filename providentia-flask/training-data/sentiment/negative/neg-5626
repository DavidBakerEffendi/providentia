Tried this with my boyfriend after he recommended it. I don't get the hype I mean bottomless mimosas are cool but 18$ isn't a huge sale. I got biscuits and gravy and I was vastly disappointed. They should tell you it's deconstructed biscuits and gravy. So a puddle of gravy with a heavy biscuit and eggs on top. Served with a dirty looking wilted carrot and piece of broccoli like why? He got the steak and eggs and he wasn't impressed. Probably won't return because the food just isn't anything special.
