Worst service I have ever experienced in Charlotte. The Indian lady who attends to the customers is so rude and literally throws the plate in the table as though we have come for some free food. But the other lady was so nice and courteous. I'm not sure if the Indian lady is the owner or just a manager, she needs to learn how to treat people. Will never come back. Google reviews about this place says it all. Bad that I missed checking google reviews before thinking to go to this damned place. 

Food taste is not good either. I am from south India and I can't even call them as a South Indian cuisine.
