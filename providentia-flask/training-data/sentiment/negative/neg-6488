This is, quite literally, THE WORST GREEK RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER IN MY LIFE EXPERIENCED.  SERIOUSLY.  Run from this place.  The food was horrible.  The prices, frankly, OUTRAGEOUS.   I ordered roasted lamb.  How do you manage to screw that up?  Megas manages just fine thank you!  The salad was A JOKE.  No real Greek dressing, creamy dressing, and the salad was SO OVERDRESSED I couldn't eat it.  Waitress doesn't bother to ask.  Main course, even worse.  No Greek rice, tasteless rice with carrots and peas.  Potatoes have to be from last week, SWIMMING in GREASE.  Odd raw carrot thing, no flavor at all.  Lamb was ALSO SWIMMING in GREASE!  Just disgusting.  Waitress asks how it was.  I said, OK I guess.  SHE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO ASK WHAT WAS WRONG.  THEN THE PRICE?  $22.99.  $3 FOR A SINGLE COKE.  SERIOUSLY????  Shameful food and service.  HOW IS THIS PLACE STILL IN BUSINESS???  RUN AWAY FOLKS.  REALLY.
