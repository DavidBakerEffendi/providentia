I was definitely shocked by the quality of food at this caliber of a hotel. We ate here for dinner and arrived at 9pm on Easter Sunday. The place was packed and service was incredibly good.

The food however was terrible. I kept going back for different items, hoping for something quality. All I found were the lambs chops.

The fish was very dry, the salads had soggy lettuce, the side items were all very weak.  

I'm upset that the wicked spoon was closed early for Easter Sunday, because this bellagio buffet really just seems aged, tired and ready for retirement.
