We noticed today that there were no customers so went and took a look.  There is an eviction notice on the door stating they were $135K in arrears on rent!  The date was August 14, 2013.  I would guess that means they are gone for good now.  I wonder who will go in there next?

Update on 2/24/14 - There is a sign out front saying it will be reopening soon as Yongs Super Buffet $9.99 for lunch and $15.99 for dinner.  I hope the new owners do a better job!
