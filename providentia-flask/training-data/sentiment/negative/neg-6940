Yet another terrible airport restaurant! Terrible, terrible, terrible. All I wanted was a simple sandwich to go. First, $8 for a simple turkey sandwich?  When I asked for it "to go" he put a lid on the plate. Really?  How am I supposed to fit that in my luggage??  All I wanted was a subway style piece of paper!
