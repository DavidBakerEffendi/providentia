I have to say I USED to love Fuku burger back when they only had a good truck. I made sure to look at their schedule online and went to their location. After years of not having it because they opened a restaurant at the Hawaiian Market Place and the Linq, my Husband and I finally went tonight. We have been craving it since we saw that the restaurant on Jones was opening. 

We arrived around 6:40pm and they had a total of 3 other tables. Two of which already had their food. As I was ordering 2 guys came up and stated to one of the cooks that their sodas didn't taste right. Apparently the female cashier knew and said, "yea I know we need to change the co2."  Um...if she knew why did she fill the cups and give them drinks? Anyhow, we didn't get our food until 7:22pm! Really, 42 minutes for 2 burgers and an order of garlic fries?! That's crazy! As I went to get our food (mind you the two cups from the 2 guys before were still on the counter, untouched) I asked what is going on with our drinks. One of the cooks said we are having trouble with the co2 and we are currently working on it. I said ok what are we going to drink since we have our food now? He gave me a blank look as the female cashier said I'll refund you the price of the drink and give you another non-fountain drink. As she was refunding me and giving me drinks (less than 2 mins) I returned to the table and started eating. Can I say really? The food was cold. Cold as if it had been sitting in the open. My burger was soggy on the bottom from the oil, the burger patty was hard as if it has been sitting out for hours and the fries? Let's not go there. I don't understand why it took so long for 1 and to be served cold food after we waited so long is beyond me. 

I have to say we won't be back. It was a waste of our time and money. Oh, it was freezing inside! It was so cold you wouldn't enjoy being there either.
