Just had an absolutely terrible experience at Sienna Mercato. Just terrible. This one is on you, general manager Krista Koller. 100% on you. 

A friend had arranged to hold an after party for their wedding here. The guests (about 30 of us) got there around midnight and got some drinks in the upstairs beer garden while waiting for the bride and groom to arrive. When they arrived just before 1am and the general manager, Krista Koller, wouldn't let them in because they didn't have their IDs on them. It's the wedding day, and quite understandable that in the midst of everything they forgot to carry their IDs. Wedding dresses usually don't have pockets. Remember that this is the bride and groom - the couple that had organized to have their party here in the first place. Let alone the facts that this is their wedding day and that these individuals are clearly over 21 (two facts that by themselves any sensible, reasonable manager should consider), the fact that she refused to allow the people who organized the event to enter the event is insane! What kind of person is this? Sienna Mercato, you seem like a decent establishment, but if this is the kind of people you have running the place then forget it. There are tons of great places in Pittsburgh, and I'll go to the places that have reasonable human beings with at least some sense of decency running the show.

I mean, seriously...on their wedding day...really? REALLY? You're going to be that much of a jerk to a newly wed couple? What is wrong with you Krista Koller?
