Seriously!?  So I ordered from them twice last week.  Delivery.  They messed up my order just a little (wrong bread) on one of them, eh, no big deal.  The delivery time was OK, but not fast...about 20 minutes.  Well today, I need to leave my house for a job interview at 12:45, so I order at 12:15.  I wait till 12:50, then leave.  My wife is still home... apparently they showed up around 1.  Sorry, but that is not freaky fast, at all!  Then they have the nerve to say I am out of their delivery area.  Then what are you doing?  Did they tell me this and say it make take longer than usual, NO.  Did they decline my order for delivery, NO.   Not to mention why they heck am I out of your delivery range...I live at 87th & Bell - 1 mile from your shop.  I canceled my order and they gave me my money back, but the whole situation is very frustrating!

I love the food and when I have ordered from other locations it is truly freaky fast.  Very disappointed in how this location carries the JJs name.
