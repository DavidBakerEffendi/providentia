Not the best place. Nothing authentic or original, the cup of bread is microwaved dough that stiffens almost instantly after hitting the table. I'm a huge foodie and do my best in trying new breakfast/brunch places and sadly, this one left a sour taste in my mouth. The staff is great and attentive but the food didn't measure up. Sorry Rise & Shine.... I tried.
