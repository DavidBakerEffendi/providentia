The worst service from management possible. They gave me the wrong item at the deli. I ordered cucumber cream cheese spread, and they gave me pickle instead. I bought their bagels, too.My wife thought she was getting something good. She totally gagged when she tasted it, and threw it all in the trash. I tried to return the item, but the OWNER gave me the third degree about when I bought it. True, i did wait a few days...until I had a reason to go by that area. In his mind, people leave this in the refrigerator and then want to come by to get new stuff. I was going to spend around $40 or more on breakfast, but I ended up walking out with my wife. What a jerk he was to me! I don't want anything free!  Ever! What the hell? He was taking his bad day out on me!  I'm still shocked! I previously liked this place and I am not a rude person. The breakfasts are not very good..they don't even have hash-browns. The sandwich meats are all VERY hard to chew, unless you have them shave it super-thin, and then it is like mush. The bagels are good, though. One out of ten isn't good enough.
