This place is making downtown mesa look bad! First time I ate here it was good and the prices were fair. Two months later the prices have been jacked up and the portions size went down, not sure how that works? Maybe they got a new chef since I ate there last? The staff seemed like they didn't know what they were doing or who they were serving. The Manger of this place needs to be replaced or just put a better restaurant on that corner.  Let's hope they don't delete this Honest review!
