Went here with family and they were far from closed (8:00 pm)... We were brought chips but we were not greeted again for another 15 minutes...not even a drink order! All the young servers were playing around in the kitchen and ignoring the guests.  After not having drinks after almost 20 minutes and multiple servers walking past us laughing, we left without service. Terrible experience.
