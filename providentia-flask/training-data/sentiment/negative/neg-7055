Had the mother's day buffet today and I left unimpressed with the food and service. The food was not worth the 20 dollars for the adults nor 10 dollars for my 7 and 9 year old. The food was not refreshed throughout the buffet time and the wait for the waffle bar was long. The carved meat station was being "ran " by same man who was making waffles which made for a wait. We ordered drinks and it took 15 min to get the drink .. It was a coke.  The menu was short on kid options so we definitely overpaid on feeding our kids waffles. The fresh fruit was far from fresh and I had more than one stawberry that was visibly rotten and not fresh at all.  You would think that since this was a mothers day event that mothers would have been given at least a discount .... Nope ..not even a free drink.  ( which pop on the weekends runs $5!)   What I was really unimpressed with was the extra money they placed a hold on in my account. We paid $80 but they ran my account  for $97 and after talking to my credit card company they said that some restaurants place holds on account for "incidentals.. I have never had this happen before and now that I know Becky's Bistro did this to my account I will never recommend or have another family gathering there again. Shame on your service and shame on you. I will be calling to discuss  this further with the restaurant on Monday . I will update review after speaking with the manger or owner.
