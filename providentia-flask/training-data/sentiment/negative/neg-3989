The use of the word gourmet is false advertising here. My wife and I were deeply disappointed with our visit to this buffet. We came in Easter Sunday and paid an increased price and hoped it would be worth it and it was not. The food was bland and not in any way fresh. There were several dishes that were empty. It was so crowded you could barely move and lines built up around the meat area. I found the over all dish options to be disappointing. The only thing decent was the dessert options. The rest was just meh. Not at all worth the price. Nothing is more disappointing then being really excited about something and being completely let down.
