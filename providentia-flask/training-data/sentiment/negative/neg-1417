Terrible. Pot stickers were so overcooked, they crunched like raw pasta. Very obviously frozen previously. Gross. If you're ordering the pineapple chicken, be prepared to sift through lots of huge chunks of ginger. I enjoy very spicy foods, and understand ginger for flavor, but chunks that look just like the pineapple? So unbelievably bitter. Would not refund. I was really looking forward to this place, given the previous reviews. Don't waste your time or money.
