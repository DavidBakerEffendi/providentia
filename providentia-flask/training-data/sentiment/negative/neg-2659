I was really hoping the negative reviews would be a little off, but they weren't.  The papaya salad was bland with no spices and not spicy at all!  It was just a lot of fish sauce and shredded papaya.  The green and red curry dishes were also very bland without any spices and the chicken and pork were rock hard.  We had to add the red chili sauce to the curry that came with the lettuce wraps.  The lettuce wraps were gooey and also bland.  The steak salad was in fact spicy and I asked for dressing on the side, but the dressing was already on the salad.  The steak was tough.  There's nothing "Thai" about this place.  I love Thai food and have been to numerous Thai restaurants and this was by far the worst Thai restaurant I've tried. Very disappointing.
