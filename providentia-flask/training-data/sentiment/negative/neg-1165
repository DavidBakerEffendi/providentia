Well. that sucks. stale bread. no chips. mediocre service. eh. whats all the hype about? 

Oh and ps- when and I call and tell you I ordered a fruit salad and I didn't get it, it's not rocket science. Just say I can come back and get one. Don't get all confused and argue with me just because your brain can't compute the words I am saying!? Rude! Better luck next time.


** for those of you that have a problem with my review, feel free to email me and ask any questions you like. I wrote this review by MY own means, and based on MY own experience**

A couple things I forgot to have mentioned, was their way over priced baked goods. The cupcake I got was so oily I could barely choke it down, and the iced tea was so overwhelming I had to poor half of it out and add water. Maybe, I went on an off day, maybe not, but this is my experience of this establishment. Take it or leave it.
