Un. Believable. We popped in here for brunch with some friends since there was a massive wait at a more popular breakfast place in the area. We had been here before to try the different craft beers, but had never experienced the food menu.

The decor is beautiful and whoever designed it has fabulous taste, but that is the extent of my positivity about this place.

I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich of sorts and what I got has turned me off chicken for the foreseeable future. The sandwich itself was bland, but being hungry I got through the first half kind of just deciding I would never order this particular item again if we came back. What I got with the first bite of my second half is what this review is about. 

I bit into the sandwich and got a mouthful of grizzle and fat so I popped open the sandwich after spitting my bite out and pulled out a huge chunk of fat. My Hubs (not being as picky as me) thought I was over exaggerating and went to eat it and what he got he had to spit out as well.

After sending it back, someone (I am assuming a shift manager, she didn't introduce herself) came out and asked what was wrong with it. I explained my complaint and she said the kitchen staff had examined the carnage and agreed it was sub par.  I told her I was shocked that any person with half a brain would send something of this poor quality out of the kitchen, let alone expect a paying guest to consume it. She offered me 50% off my sandwich as a gesture of their apology. I laughed a little (while just shaking my head) because I didn't feel like arguing about it, but what if I had taken that half to eat first? Unfortunately she affected our servers tip and I believe she owes our server the difference. 

So, I will "take" your 50% off the sandwich (a lousy apology, by the way, for my disturbing experience) and I will "see" you one review.

See you "never"!
