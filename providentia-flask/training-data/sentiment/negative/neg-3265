From the moment we walked in it was filthy I honestly went home and showered after. The decor was tacky and lots of dust everywhere.  Service was okay but the food was not good at all. I've had poboys in the past in Louisiana which were very good. The french bread was old and hard and the lettuce was wilted. For $12 only 4 fried shrimp in a 7 inch sandwich is ridiculous. My boyfriend received the oyster sandwich and half of it was burnt fried pieces with no oysters in it. What's even worse was the beignets. It honestly tasted like old dirty oil that they never replaced when frying them. How could you make a beignet taste like oil? I will not be going back and will wait to have a real Poboy when I go back to Louisiana.

FYI. If you try to order sides they don't have them.
