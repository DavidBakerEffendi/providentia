The bad service started at the door with the hostess in the gray dress black hair horrible, Did I say horrible, I really meant horrible. We were a party of four that ordered two meatloaves, Fish and chips and a salad. We had two house cabs and two sodas the bill with tip was just under $100. Fish and chips was very  greasy, meatloaf was just like the hostess horrible and the salad was something you would pick up at a gas station store. I wish I could post negative stars for the hostess alone.
