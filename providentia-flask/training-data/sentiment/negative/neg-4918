For how much this buffet is you would expect much better food. Something in this food made my sis and I soooo sick we were puking in the bathrooms outside.  Also they charged our party an automatic 80$ tip and the service was terrible. When I asked for tea he told me he will get it "hold on a minute!" They need to bring in higher quality food and service. The rio buffet is much better if you are a buffet type person:/
