So this was my 2nd time there. And now my stars were cut in half-
Food was phenomenal the first time I was there  (July 2009) 
We did the omokase style dining and my hubs and I were simply enchanted with the whole visit.  We were raving about the food, the service, the ambience- it was great!  But my 2nd time there was horrible.

Here's a summary (on a scale of 5)

Wait staff- 3
Food quality- 5
Wait time- 0
Management- 0

We had a party of 12 and were there for a total of 4 hours.  The wait staf was nice (Issaac) but I guess too overwhelmed to be attentive. (Even though they did charge the 20% gratuity)

Food was delicious but SUPER slow.  I have no idea what was going on with the cooks, but management should've taken some responsibility and put us at ease somewhere between the 4 hours of our visit.

Our waiter brought us a round of shots to make up for the wait I suppose.  Nice, but NOT nice to have it thrown in your face as if a favor was made. The manager did this???

We were brought a total of 3 different checks because they kept screwing up.  This made us doubt that they were being fair in the way they were charging us- and we were right.  There were items on the bill that were not brought to our table. SHAME ON U!

We tried to relay our disatisfaction to "Brian" one of the managers, but he came at us with a complete bad attitude.  He ASSUMED that we were trying to get a free meal, when all we really wanted was for him to take some responsibility and admit that they SUCKED!

I might return- but probably not with a large party.
