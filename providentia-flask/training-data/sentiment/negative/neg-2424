Do not eat here!!!!! Staff are very rude and loved talking amongst themselves rather than to paying customers. We arrived and waited for a table to be cleaned. Everyone noticed us just standing there but no one was in a rush to clean the tables off so that we could sit. Finally, when the lady went to clean the table she did so about 1/3 of the way and STOPPED to answer the work phone so that she could take an order over the phone, which left us standing! None of the other coworkers seemed bothered by it either bc no one stepped in to clean the table. After the phone order was taken another customer who was leaving wanted to pay his tab so, this same worker then proceeded to cash him out first before cleaning the table for us to sit down. Lastly, after we stood for a good 7-10mins (waiting for a table) before the worker cleaned it. When it was time to take our order she did so in a whispering manner! But was heard speaking way louder to her coworkers. I had to ask her several times what she was saying. The workers were extremely loud and playful and talked a lot about their personal lives. It was SO many workers there but no true team work at all!!!! One worker kept staring at me while he was on the bacon line! Very Weird!! Food was okay. My bf asked for grits but got hash browns. No one wore hair nets! JUST HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Should have trusted the reviews. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, SERVICE!!!!! Go some place else!
