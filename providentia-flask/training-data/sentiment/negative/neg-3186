Oh the quality has gone down. I have to admit I haven't been back to this place for a while now but definitely not coming back for good.

This place is pretty pricey if you just want to grab a quick lunch. But I don't mind pricey food if the quality is  somewhat good but ...

12$ for combo #3 which comes with chicken katsu and Barbque chicken.
- chicken in katsu was pretty non-existent, felt like I was eating only crunchy breading. 
- the Barbque chicken was stringy... Why is my chicken stringy?! 
- the cabbage was rotting... There were black spots in the cabbage. I actually enjoy eating cabbage but not this time around. 

Save your money and your calories and go somewhere else.
