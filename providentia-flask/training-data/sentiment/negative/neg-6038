Not good at all.  This place advertises itself as healthy Mexican food and I've been meaning to stop in for awhile.  They serve at a counter, where you pick your entree.  I decided to go for the 2 taco combo on soft corn tortillas, one with shredded beef and the other steak.  He threw the tortillas on a grill, which I presumed would make them hot, but they were not.  Scooped the beef in sauce out of a bin on one tortilla and pulled steak pieces out of another.  I also had a scoop of Mexican rice and I chose the black beans.  The only thing served hot were the beans.  The next person behind the counter topped the meat with toppings of my choice - pico de gallo, corn, cilantro - and gave me a cup for my drink.

They have a separate area with toppings, corn, salsa, hot sauce, mild sauce, jalapenos and olives.  The salsa tasted like tomato sauce and the hot sauce was barely hot.

I went to my table, picked up the shredded beef taco and the tortilla broke apart in pieces.  They really should double the tortillas for tacos.  The beef was lukewarm, the toppings cold and wasn't very flavorful.  The steak on the other taco was cold, dried out and very tough, I couldn't even pull it apart with my hands.  I took the steak out and just ate the tortilla with the rice, beans, corn and pico de gallo.  

They were pretty busy here and maybe I ordered the wrong stuff, but I don't think I'll be back to try something else.  The food just was not good or fresh.

About $8 for the 2 taco combo plus a medium drink.
