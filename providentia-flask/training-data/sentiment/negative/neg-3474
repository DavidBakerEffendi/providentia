My last experience with Sushi Island was terrible. A friend can not eat gluten and the staff was unable to understand or communicate which items had gluten in them. Several orders were forgotten and requests for beverages completely ignored. Todays experience was probably even more frustrating however. Walked in at 10 (they close at 11) and they were closing and refused to serve us.

My over all take away from this restaurant is that the food is nothing special and the staff gave me no reason to come back. Unreliable hours. Complete headache.
