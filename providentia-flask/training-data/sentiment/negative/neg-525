Very disappointed in Cheesecake Factory, tried it a few times bc of friends wanting to eat there. And it's all been the same, I am not hard to please whatsoever but I would of rather gone to Dairy Queen to get a meal and dessert. Money doesnt matter to me but quality of a meal does the last experience will be my last one. Went there with a date ordered two appetizers calamari was perfect but the crab bites was horrible. Ordered two alcoholic drinks one of which was a mint mojito never had anyone butchered the drink that much it was awful. After waiting an hour after finishing our appetizers our food still wasn't out yet nor was the server anywhere to be found, it being not busy and also a Monday night we didnt understand why it was taking so long, finally the manager came over and told us that our food was accidentally sent to another table, understandable we was patient and said its ok 10 mins later someone other than the server brought the food over to our table and it was not what we ordered. Not touching the food we waited a while til the server came to check on us told her the issue she took the plates away and returned with our order, I'm guessing my food was sitting under the warmer in the kitchen for a while bc my steak Dianne was over cooked and dry when I ordered it rare, and the salmon was fishy and cold. The only thing that was truly acceptable was the cheese cake I guess if they messed that up they shouldn't be called the cheese cake factory! I will not be returning anytime soon and I won't be recomending it to anyone considering it was 120 bucks for two people and the food was awful like the service!
