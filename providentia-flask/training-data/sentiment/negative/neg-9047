Had the absolute worst experience here. We signed up for the taco crawl and this as one of the stops. We asked the hostess to be put on a wait list for a table because we wanted to get some food and drinks. There were 4 or so tables open and she said they had some reservations but there was a 20 minute wait but because we were part of the taco crawl we couldn't have a table. I explained again that we wanted to buy food and drinks, our 2 little tacos we had at other stops were not enough and we wanted to try this place. She told us we absolutely could not be on the list because they don't give tables to taco crawl people. They clearly have enough business don't want my business. I don't understand why they even participate in the crawl if they don't want people to spend money at their establishment. They shouldn't even sign up.
