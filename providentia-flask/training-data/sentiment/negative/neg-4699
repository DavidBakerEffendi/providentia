My sister and I went to dinner on a Friday night around 8 and there were only 3 other tables with diners besides ours. Not a good sign, but we stuck it through. 
We should have gone with our initial assessment because we found it over-priced and boring. The Wait-staff was completely disinterested in us (i think she only had 2 other tables), pretty slow, and the food was just OK. Nothing fancy, no amazing plating, no super portions, just some food slapped on your plate like you get at home. 
The Decor was fine (pretty usual "Big-fat-greek-wedding" style of decor), there were cloth tablecloths and napkins, and the karioke music was cheerful overhead. But all this was somehow more than the food and service deserved. i was also really dissapointed that they were so dead because i was hoping for some dancing with other guests or even, best case senario, a bellydancer, (they have a picture of one on their site so I was excited) but nada.  
We had 1 bowl of the lemon soup, an order of the spinach turn-overs, main entrees were a chicken kabob plate (dry) and a veggie plate. My sister wanted the custard dessert, but we decided it would take too long and probably not be that good. 
Grand total: $60+ and an hour I'll never get back
