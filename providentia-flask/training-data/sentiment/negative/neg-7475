I enjoyed the feel of this place but became disappointed as I received my food. I ordered a two sliders since they are typically smaller and some fried pickles. The sliders were the size of a small cheese burger which typically wouldn't be a compliant but I did in fact order sliders for the feel of them. My fried pickles were completely saturated in grease, even leaving a small puddle. Needless to say I did not eat them. The burger was good, but the fries were my favorite part. Probably would not go there again.
