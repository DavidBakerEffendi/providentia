Brutal!  Went here on the advice of someone working at a nearby business and was absolutely floored at how bad it was.  Ordered iced tea and it tasted like it was made from water filtered through nougat!  Yuck!  My friends meal looked very lackluster.  He said the meat was fine, but nothing special.  I had some long noodles with bulgogi.  I normally love this dish, but something was really off with this.  My friend finished, we paid the bill and left.  Ended up at Los Tacos next door and was thrilled I had discovered my new favorite taco stand.  Island Style came through with that at least.
