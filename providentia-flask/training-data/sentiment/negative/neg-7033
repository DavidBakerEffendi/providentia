Sadly I won't be returning even though it is within walking distance. Too bad as I like the chain but this one isn't up to the name. The service is fairly good but the food is sub par. As my first visit was opening week I figured I would give them a second try after a couple months. Sadly strike two. No third shot at this one when there are so many other good restaurants in the area. If you just want to have a beer and watch a game the lounge has some nice screens but cross the road for your meal.
