My boyfriend and I ate here just an hour ago. His food, in his words, was "pretty okay". He had the buffalo chicken wrap. My food is indescribable without using excessive profanity: but here goes. I ordered the Reuben. It was plated nicely, huge visual appeal. First bite? Awful. Rubbery dog sh*t with half*ss corned beef flavor. Usually a small part of whatever meat is going to be gristle or rubbery or whatever but the rest is redeemable or great. So I tried two more bites which were equally awful. Then made my boyfriend (nicest guy ever) try a bite. He didn't say anything. I left the whole thing mangled on the plate. I want to say I'm disappointed in my food but 'disgusted' and 'outraged' fit way better. Suggestion for you guys- put the Reuben with the French dip: OFF THE MENU.

We will not return.
