I ordered takeout, so I cannot comment on the service.  Their menu consists of pasta dishes and pizza, as well as appetizers.  We had the black and blue risotto fritters for an appetizer.  They were two large patties, heavily breaded and very greasy.My biggest disappointment is that the proteins were barely flavored and thrown together with the pasta.  I am used to having Italian food that has flavors blended together, this seemed randomly thrown together.  I had penne pasta with chicken.  The pasta was drenched in sauce, and grilled, tasteless chicken placed on top.  With all of the fine Italian eateries in the area, I will not be back.
