This was hard review for me to write. I wanted to be fair. I ordered the sushi buffet. I can say that it was definitely an experience I'll never forget. I couldn't get home fast enough. I can honestly say I'll never go back. It was a no for me. If you have a sensitive stomach you might want to order your roll fresh cause.
