Taco Tuesday?! Not at this joint. Our pathetic tacos had three baby slivers of chicken with a whole lot of cabbage. After calling over the server and showing her our sad tacos, her response was "what do you want me to do with it?!"  Screw it, take it back and can my husband have another margarita....30 minutes later it arrives with no apology attached! 

Customer service is not a priority in this establishment!
