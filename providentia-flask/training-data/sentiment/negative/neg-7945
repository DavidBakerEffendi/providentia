So unorganized. Flies in the food area, since they opened the doors to the outside. Visited ONLY to see a free comedy show. There is no "comedy club". It was held in Sarah's Kitchen, where other people were eating and didn't know about a show. Why would they put a show in there, when they cannot accomodate accordingly? Very, very small venue. Would not recommend, even for a free show. Would not trust the food, with the flies roaming around - they were so overwhelmed that so many ready plates were left on the counter for the flies to taste before the customers - made us change our mind about ordering.. Would not come back ever again because even the customers that come here are such trash that they don't even understand the concept of a line. No courtesy, just cut. It's ridiculous to come here and stress my party and I did not have to deal with.
