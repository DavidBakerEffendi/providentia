My group went here late last night around 2:30 AM on 11 February 2018. We chose to come here because it was open until 3:30 AM on a Saturday and the ratings were good.

When we went there we were the only customers. I had to find the staff to let them know that we were here. A female Korean wait staff (I did not see a name tag) came out at told us that they were closing and that last call is in 10 minutes. I replied that the signs outside said that it was open until 3:30 AM. Since it was not last call, we said that we can order quickly.

We asked for menus and water to start off. The waitress slammed the water and cups rudely on the table. She indicated that she wanted us out. She succeeded in kicking us out but she was rude and her tone was definitely angry. After a few minutes, our group was not feeling the group and service of this type, warranted no tip for sure. We left but I told the waitress that she got what she wanted and that because it was so obvious that she did not want to work, her attitude got her what she wished for.

We got no apology for closing earlier than posted and the ambivalence caused me trouble as I was finding a place for my out of town guest to eat. I hope that the owner or manager reprimands the waitress that was working at that time last night. I did see two staff (one male and one female) and only had interaction with the female one.
