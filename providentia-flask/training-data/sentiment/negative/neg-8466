Very disappointed, being that I'm a seafood junkie,I was soooo excited to try an All you can eat seafood Buffett!!!! Went straight to the lobster and ummm I thought I was being fooled because that was not lobster nor did it tastes like lobster..all I taste was rubber and no flavor.poor quality food people!!!! Then I headed to crab legs they're salty and dry!!!!!!!!! At that point I felt robbed!!!! Please don't go here poor quality food not worth the price!!! If you want good crab legs head to Tuscany every Friday only Fridays they have all you can eat juicy warm crab legs for half price 19.99 Rio shame on you for advertising an upscale all you can eat seafood experience with poor quality food.
