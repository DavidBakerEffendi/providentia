I went in for breakfast on a weekend and tried to order the yogurt and granola (sold out), then the orange juice (only had Orangia, not orange juice), then ordered the toast with butter and jam which was only one of 6 or so things on the breakfast menu.  I was give 4 thin slightly toasted pieces of bread in a bag with cold packets of butter and Smuckers apple jelly.  Every run of the mill deli, coffee shop, etc puts the butter on the toast.  And they charged me $2.95 pre tax.  And they had the nerve to tell me everything was made in house (granola, bread, whatever).  Smuckers couldn't be farther than homemade.  I did get a little attitude in addition to the toast and a latte which wasn't half bad.  Just don't charge people $3 for lukewarm toast and crap jelly.  Please.
