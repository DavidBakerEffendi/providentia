Worst indian food ever.  When you write a bad review, they'll petition yelp to remove it.  So it's so bad here , I'm writing again. 

The tandoori chicken is not authentic tandoori. Anyone can take red food coloring and put it on baked chicken!!!
All curries are prepared poorly....water and curry powder doesn't equal curry. 

Guys. This place also has the nastiest restroom of a restaurant in scottsdale.  Stay away.
