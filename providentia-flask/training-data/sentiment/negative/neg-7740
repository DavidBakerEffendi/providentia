Ordered 2 entrees of bell pepper chicken and only received 1 small thing of rice, I went back inside to ask for an an additional rice the kid at the front told me it's going $2.50 extra for the rice I told him I ordered to entrees so I should get 2 rice but he said no it only comes with one and I need to pay for the extra. You just lost a customer over $2.50 for some rice, great customer service!
