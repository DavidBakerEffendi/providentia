I would give this place 0 stars if I could. I will be making the long drive from Indian land to the CHARLOTTE RIVERGATE location after the service I received. When you enter the location, know that you will see is about 5 teenagers sitting around the counter talking/ gossiping VERY loudly. Loud enough that you can hear them using offensive language such as bit** and retarded. You will not get greeted and when you fill out the sandwich bag for your order, you'll have to wait for them to finish their teenage conversations for them to ring you up and make your sandwich (they stopped several times to converse instead of completing the sandwich). It took 10 minutes for me to get a sandwich that gets made in less than 5 at other Which Wich locations. There were 2 tables that could've been cleaned and no other customers in the facility that needed to be tended too. So I'm wondering why there's 5 teens (who I assume were put in charge to run the place) standing around chatting and rudely "serving customers". Don't waste your time at this place.
