Edit (new review)- we USED to go here all the time and it's gradually gotten worse and worse.Tonight was the worst visit by far! The fish tasted disgusting!!! The second we took a bite my husband and I both looked at each other with an expression of, "this is our last time here.. Such a shame because this place started off great.


Old review - 
So far we've gone once a week! It's delicious! Yoshi makes a mean roll and we love the options! Very good Happy Hour as well!  The 808 Special & the Yoshi roll are amazing!!!!
