The quality of food has gone WAY down.  The calamari was pretty much just small fried batter pieces. I'm pretty sure the Cesar salad lettuce was just packaged lettuce because the color was dull greenish-yellow and just thrown into a pile on a plate. We also ordered the shrimp scampi, which was overall very average. The shrimp pieces however were large and pretty good. 

But for the prices they charged, the food was bad. I get that the restaurant is in a hotel/casino, but it's not even a real restaurant considering the location and lack of walls.
