Unfortunately, after multiple visits to this location, the customer service seems to have only worsened. If you want Rosati's pizza, you're better off calling it in.

Waitresses were busy mingling (literally sitting at tables chatting) with patrons, and then after their shifts (I hope) drinking at the bar. All the while, our pizza took much longer than most establishments to come out. 

We had come to watch the UFC fights and had to ask on three different occasions for ONE of their 20 TV's to be changed. 

It was also 55 degrees outside after a weekend of cold rain in early January, and the garage door that apparently serves as a dual entrance was wide open for the entirety of our 4-hour visit. If you didn't bring a jacket and gloves, you were screwed. And if you expected to eat warm food, you were screwed.

Also, the lighting here is overwhelming for a restaurant/bar. The unnatural bright white interrogation-style lighting is obnoxious to the point of eye irritation. As petty as that might sound, it's definitely the first thing you notice upon arrival... and won't forget.

Overall, not a recommended hang out for drinks. Not a recommended restaurant for dine-in pizza. But if you want a decent tasting and decently-made pizza, call it in and pick it up, or maybe have it delivered.
