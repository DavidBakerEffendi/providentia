I really want to love this place, but it just isn't that great.  I want to love it because I know that it is locally owned and should be deemed authentic.  It is only authentic in the way that it reminds me of going to dinner parties with my parents and being subjected to eating Desi food that wasn't good.  It reminds me of a bad auntie's (family friends are aunties and uncles regardless of whether or not you are actually related) cooking.  Too much oil, not a good balance of flavor, and not the highest quality of meat.  It reminds me of giving my mother dirty looks for making me come to the stupid dinner party with bad Desi food.

If you are dying for Indian food in this area, I'd suggest going a bit further down Bell Road to Tandoori Times 2.  You won't be disappointed there...
