Very bad experience.  Server spilled sauce all over coat.  Waitress told us to clean the coat and the owner would pay the bill.  After many many revisits to the restaurant the owner has still not resolved.   In fact he became very rude.  We don't need owners like that.   Would have probably been happy with a sorry.  I would never recommend going to this restaurant.
