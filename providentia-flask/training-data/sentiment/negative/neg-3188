I have loved bobbies for 15 years plus! Today was the worst Bobbie ever! I opened my beautiful pink wrapping and what a disappointment! I can even explain ! What the heck happened? It looks like a peanut butter sandwich! Is it because I was getting a sandwich free? (Because of buying 9 sandwiches with app) Why isn't someone trained right? I didn't want to call the manager and complain because what's going to happen? Oh the next ones free?! No I don't want a free one! I wanted this one to be awesome! Ughhh well I will not be going to this Capriotti's ever again!! I hope someone from management sees this review! I hope y'all train you staff to make them the right way! Please
