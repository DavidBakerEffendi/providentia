So, I decided to try out their special, the sea bass. It was extremely sweet and syrupy.  I forced myself to ignore the putrid fishiness that was underneath all of that sweetness, but that was a bad idea. I had explosive diarrhea immediately after finishing. Have fun cleaning that up in your single stall bathroom. Also, the apple crumb dessert was excessively sour and frankly just f***ing disgusting.  I wasn't planning on writing this review until I had another panicking man rush me while I was on the toilet because he ate some bad lobster.  

Friendly service, but disgusting food.
