We ordered a chicken and avocado sandwich dish, a seafood fettucine type of dish, and a pork tenderloin dish. All three were bad to medicore. The pork "tender"loin was dry and tough. The chicken and avocado was forgettable. The seafood fettucine was bad- watery and bland. They did put enough seafood in though. 2 stars for the food. That is to say i would've given this place if it were a $10/person type of place. But it's not. The service was nauseatingly slow too.
