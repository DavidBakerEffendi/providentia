The food is great, but the service is horrible.   Everyone outside the kitchen needs to be fired.  They need someone who knows how to run a restaurant.  Attempted to eat lunch there on a Thursday afternoon and was unable to do so despite the Buffet being completely stocked. They told me I couldn't be served because the chef had left for the day.   The more confusing part was three people in front of me proceeded without issue, who picked up their plates literally 10 seconds before I did.  When eating in, the service is every bit as bad as all the other reviews detail:

  - Extremely slow
  - Errors taking/receiving your order
  - Parts of the meal show up at varying times
  - Servers do not pay attention to their customers
  - Drink refills, may as well get it yourself
  - Nan - good luck getting it
  - God forbid you need your check anytime soon

When speaking to their management about problems encountered, they just look at you in amazement, very sorry very sorry.  Nothing changes...   How about fixings the problems. 

Update:  returned on Monday 3/6/17 @12:30 - hours on the door clearly state they are open, yet they were closed with no explanation when they would be open.
