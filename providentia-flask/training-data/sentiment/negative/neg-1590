My family and I came in a small group to eat dinner for my grandmother's birthday. It was super bowl Sunday and most places were closing early however this restaurant was still open for an hour or so. I'm giving BLD a 1 star due to the quality- rather lack there of service and poor food quality. After waiting for 15 minutes for the server to come back to the table to take our drink orders, she then told us we were given the wrong menus. The server was nice enough, although we could tell that she just wanted to be off her shift already and in no hurry to serve us. My grandmother's order came out wrong. Not to mention we all had some sort of food-related sickness just hours later.
My aunt called this morning to let them know of the poor service we had had, their response was, "we will let the kitchen know." Which leads me to believe they not only do not care about the food they are cooking/serving but also customer service doesn't matter to them either. 
We will never eat here again. Do not suggest this place what so ever. They don't even season their potatoes!
