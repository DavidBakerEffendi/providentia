This is the ONLY poor performer in the Wynn.

Every casino has a 24-hour restaurant where you should be able to get a reasonably priced plate of eggs at a odd time.

The first time we came, they had at least half of their tables open but would not seat us. We left. We came back at 7am, and they took 30 minutes to make breakfast dishes when we were the only ones in the restaurant.

I know the Wynn is known for it's fine dining so their corned beef hash should be the best I've ever tasted. And for $12, it really wasn't. Did someone put lemon juice in it?!
