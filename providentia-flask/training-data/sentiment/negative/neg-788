Ehhhh........I don't like to give one star. This is nothing more than a step down from a Paradise Bakery. I ordered a scramble for breakfast and when they brought it to my table it looked like it been dropped on the floor then scooped up on a plate. 
When what I assumed was the manager walks by he asks me how my breakfast was, I didn't say anything, I just gave him the most dis-satisfied look I could possibly give and pointed at my eggs............and walks away. WTH??

Next time I come in and dis-satisfied with my meal, I'll be sure to stand on my chair and announce that my breakfast looks like a 5 year cooked for the first time and it tastes like COMPLETE CRAP. As he continued to make his rounds, he refused to make eye contact with me and avoided my table within 10 feet.........good customer service buddy. 

Plenty of other options in that parking lot. There's a pile of dirt to the right that might taste just as good.
