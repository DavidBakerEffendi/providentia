Took a party of six to lunch here and it looked quite nice from the outside.  Once we got in we were greeted by a nice bartender.  We were just going to stop in for a drink as we were intending to go to the new Coconut's Mexican restaurant across the way but they did not open until noon.  Well since we all had to be back for meetings at 1pm we decided to stay.  We were told by the bartender that the food was very good and she is sadly mistaken.  I had the 1lb pulled pork with root beer BBQ sauce and it arrived lukewarm to cold and it was nearly tasteless. I ate a few bites and my stomach is in knots right now as well as two others that also had the pork.  Another coworker had the beef brisket and he said it was very greasy and his stomach is in knots as well. 

It's kind of sad that a place that is just opening isn't paying more attention.  To ruin the reputation of a very nice looking restaurant the first week or so out is horrible. They had a lot of staff on hand but it seemed like people were just walking around doing nothing. In all fairness they did try to make things right by removing my order from the bill and providing free drink cards (we left them on the table as I doubt we will be back). I hope they wake up and provide a better experience for the next diners because if they don't that is going to be one heck of a waste of money.
