I do not know how this place has such good reviews on yelp except for the fact that I think a lot of people come here drunk at 5:00AM for a huge greasy breakfast, and when you are drunk, leaving the club, things taste a lot different.
I have been here twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch. Both times where exactly the same experience. 
The service was good, servers are attentive, food comes out quickly.
Thats where it goes all bad.......
The food is terrible. Greasy diner food that is equivalent to IHOP or Dennys.
I will say that the portions are huge. They give you a lot of food..... a lot of really really bad food!!!!!
