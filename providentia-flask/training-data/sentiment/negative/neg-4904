I get the concept of the restaurant, the idea of banter or being belittled by the staff. And it could possibly be fun if you get a great waiter. What I have a problem with is using the restaurant's concept to be uselessly lazy. The menu doesn't have any description or ingredients on it... but don't bother asking. Our table didn't have a beer menu... but our waitress just shrugged her shoulders and walked away. A much better solution would be to make fun of me for being one of those "needy, pain in the ass customers" then answering my questions.
Other complaints: The food was nothing special. The portion sizes were on the small side. They force you to buy the jug they bring your drink in at an added cost (not a huge cost but really?). And the drink menu doesn't even have prices on it. 
Overall the experience was lacklustre. Even the paper hats we received to make mock us weren't original. I saw the same thing they wrote on mine when we walked in.
