Didn't think this restaurant was good or funny.  Food and drinks were over priced and food was horrible.  Our waitress was a bitch.  We asked for separate bills, she said "if you want separate bills, you should go to Applebee's".  Really, we will!  Better food and service.  You will never see us there again!
