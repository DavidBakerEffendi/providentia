WOW was that horrible service. Ordered 50 wings & they brought out all drumsticks. Waitress asked if we wanted to "send some back to swap them"? I actually had to count some out in a plate for her to take back to the kitchen. A few minutes later, she brought those back & said she didn't need them after all. Everyone in our group had to ask for every drink refill. She didn't get the drink order right, fries were not fresh, wings, I mean drumsticks were rather dry. When we got the bill, she charged an up charge for the drumsticks. Wth? We didn't want all drumsticks. I had to ask another waitress to fix the check as ours was nowhere to be seen. The only time the waitress came quickly to the table was to pick up our money. Never saw a manager. No wonder the restaurant is slow on a Friday night.
