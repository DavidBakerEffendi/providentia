There were hairs in my food. I pulled the first one out but then there was another. The server said I would not have to pay for my sandwich. When I got up to pay for the rest of the meal, the two people up front (a man and a woman) told me the total. I did not get the opportunity to review the check at the table. The total included my sandwich. I told them that the server said it would be free and the woman said that the one with the hair was free but the replacement sandwich needed to be paid for. She straight up said "You ate the second one, didn't you?" I appealed to the man and he replied that if I had refused the replacement sandwich I would not have had to pay for it but that since I went ahead and got a new one (because I needed to eat lunch) that I had to pay. I have worked in restaurants, eaten at thousands of restaurants and have never heard of a policy like this. I was floored. Paid for it and left.
