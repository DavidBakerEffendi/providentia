food 3*, management 0*
1.5 stars.
I've had the pleasure of visiting more than my fare share of hospital cafeterias and this one is probably one of the worst ones so far. 
The only food option I would go for is the self serve Pizza, other food options don't really excite the taste buds. The hot food counter which usually offers either salmon, minuscule portions of fajita or some form of Indian food is quite overpriced. The swiss Chalet option is nothing you haven't experienced before, and during your time there you will realize they will try to do everything to charge you for anything! Getting a bagel?! The little packaged jams/PB will cost ~30-60c a piece! What really took the cake though was when they removed the water tap (the only working one in this area of the hospital) and suggested patrons either buy water or get it in the w/c!! That's just indecent.
