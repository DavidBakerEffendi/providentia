The food was ok...once we got past the rude host at the front (maybe the maitre d'  - a tall guy with a mustache & little beard). We arrived at 3:52 pm on a Tuesday. The restaurant was nearly empty. There were 7 of us with 3 more coming. The host asked if we had reservations, we said no, we'd been at an event & were going to the game. 

He said he couldn't seat us as there were others who DID make reservations. (yes, he said it as if it were in CAPS!) We had to ask if the patio (which is huge & has misters) was available - yes. Then we asked if we could have a table inside if we promised to be gone by 5. He reluctantly agreed.  When my wine arrived, there was an insect in it. Our. Waiter was nice & replaced it.

The food was decent - we just had salads & appetizers. I had the Antipasta which was very small, and only came with 2 small pieces of bread. It did come with tart cherry preserves which were great.  A friend had the Tabbouli salad, which was ok, and another had the Salmon Rillette which was good. The food was ok, but nothing to write home about. 

When We left promptly at 5, the restaurant was still half empty. I had looked forward to trying this restaurant... but I probably won't go back due to the rude host turning away patrons from an empty restaurant.
