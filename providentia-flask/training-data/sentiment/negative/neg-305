Total bummer.  Who turns a buffet into a cafeteria?  Walked in, took the tour, and walked out.  Once they hand you a "Field Kitchen" debit card to use on your culinary tour around bland land, you walk the bleep out of that place.  Soup Plantation you have made a very big mistake with this endeavor.  I hope the brain trust you paid to invent this frankenstein invested that money in something other than Sweet Tomatoes Field Kitchen, kind of like a boxer throwing a fight.
