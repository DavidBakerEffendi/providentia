I wish I could give it a half or no star. But I have to make this dumb joke Bush said once (not verbatim): "fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, I'm doubly shamed". Hahaha 
Anyway, my experience was almost the same as past. We got our orders in: chicken and sirloin steak teppan dinners. And ordered some sushi. The chef Oscar was good and seemed to know what he was doing. Very entertaining with onion volcano. The main food he cooked was tasty. But the soup that we waited 26 minutes for was cold, cloudy and salty than usual miso soup. The salad was iceburg that had plopped spoonful of ginger dressing on top.  Fried rice was okay, although we were charged $2.00 each more which is a bit ridiculous. There was only ONE server and ONE teppan chef. The wait for everything was long and uneccessary. I gave this place a try again 3 years later than my original visit. Sadly....jokes on me. The only upgrade was that that took out the crusty food drenched carpet in teppen area and replaced it with lament flooring. So I was hopeful. But overall...do not go.
