If you are craving for a dried up, slightly burnt beef patty then come here! I came here to order take out on sunday 12:45pm, no burgers were coming out their kitchen for the first 20mins.  They need to butcher the cow, grind the meat and cook it? Finally got our order 45mins later, which btw it was the 3rd order (4th burger) coming out from the kitchen! The owner came over to us letting us know our orders are ready with no apologies for the long wait...which btw it turned out it was the take out bags sitting on the counter for the pass 5 mins.  Why didn't they just shout out the order number? When clearly the cashier at the counter was just standing there....ummm...looking pretty?

I order the Firefighter burger...like i mention the patty was overcooked!!! It was served with a crusted THIN slick portobello mushroom stuffed with BARELY any cheese.  For a $13.99+tax burger i had a slightly higher expectation than this! Never coming back!!
