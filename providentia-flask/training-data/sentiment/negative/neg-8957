A group of coworkers and I ordered today for lunch and the food was very bland and was not enjoyed by everyone. 

For example; 
the egg rolls included in the combo platter only had cabbage in them and were not crispy. same for the Spring rolls which were barely filled with even cabbage 
the chicken and broccoli was very bland and not seasoned 
the portion sizes were less than what we are used to from other Chinese food places 

On a positive side note, the service was polite and friendly. 

(We have been told by coworkers that Frankie's Wok in Brecksville is a good area choice, so we will be trying them next!)
