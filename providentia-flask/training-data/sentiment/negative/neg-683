Here, I'll save you some cash: Go to Wal-Mart, get a Totino's pizza, a can of SpaghettiOs (spring for meatballs, if you were planning on  eating at Il Forno, you probably have the cash.), and a six pack of Blue Moon. This was the equivalent of what I got at this sorry excuse for an Italian diner. Except I had only one bottle of beer, and they brought out the wrong kind, but the waiter argued so I drank it. 
The bill came out to $52.00! I signed up to Yelp just so I could blast this place. YOU WILL GET BETTER ITALIAN FOOD AT PIZZA HUT!
DO NOT TAKE THIS REVIEW LIGHTLY, IT WAS A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
