EVERYTHING WAS HORRIBLE!!!! The food looks so bad I thought the person before me threw up on it. "the great sushi bar" was offering selection of 4!!!! different rolls. The meat smelled like it was microwaved for the past 10 days. DO NOT EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER GO THERE. that place make McDonald's look like a 5 star restaurant. It's NOT A VEGAS EXPERIENCE.

And CRAZY expensive.
