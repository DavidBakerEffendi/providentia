I came in to buy a cookie and no one was at the counter. I called out hello about five times and no one would answer. My sister buys from this spot all the time and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I stood out on the floor for five minutes when not one but two associates came out as if nothing was the matter. Really you leave a customer waiting without having the curtousey to tell them "hold on,thank you for waiting I will be with you shortly".What world are we living? In fact which country? Has it become the norm to blatantly ignore people, hoping that they would just go away? One of the associates thought to remind that this was America and she is American as I flipped her off because I couldn't resist letting them know how careless and inconsiderate they were. Well I am an American too and I have a right to complain about the horrible treatment I experienced at this shop. Not only are they rude but the cake is dry dry dry.I will never step foot into the establishment again and nor will my sister. Too bad you lost one of your best customers because you want to make excuses for your horrid employees.
