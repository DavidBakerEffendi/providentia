The management is really stingy and strict. I had a gift certificate that I got from a third party that I had been saving for the summer so we could sit on the patio. It had not expired yet and when we walked in there was a sign at the door that said they no longer accepted those gift certificates. I had a gift certificate with a valid expiration date, not a questionable coupon. I talked to the owner and he tried to argue that a gift certificate is not in fact a contract and that he did not owe me anything in exchange for it. I think they have a very nice setting (if you don't mind a loud train running by every half hour that stops your conversation) but I will never go again because the owner is not personable with valid complaints.
