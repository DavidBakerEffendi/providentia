This was one of the worst meals I have ever had. The tuna tataki was really over seasoned, the citrus yellowtail was a poor flavor combo, crab rangoons were rubbery, and the two rolls were terrible. The only EDIBLE item was the gyoza. The quality of the sushi is very poor. If you are looking to come here for quality fish - look elsewhere. They didn't have any green tea but the sever offered us earl gray or apricot vanilla - lol. Don't think we will be going back anytime soon!
