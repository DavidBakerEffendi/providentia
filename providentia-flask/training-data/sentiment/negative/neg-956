Ugh, I became the Duke of this place on my last visit, but will relinquish my throne willingly.

Happy hour menu antics are back in play and I have had enough (must be a football season tactic judging by the pattern). We will keep our money for a place with less wily tactics. 
Here's a tip for the management always trying to cut corners on happy hour: hire less bitchy bartenders and hostesses. I mean c'mon, do you really need 2 girls standing at the door to beat back the crowds (~sarcasm~) of people you have just scared away yet again???

Oh, and don't even get me started about the one time we showed up and had to wait over 20 min. for a menu?? One Menu. ONE MENU... for 4 people and the table next to us was waiting longer for ... yep, you guessed it... for one menu. WTF??? Hello, you're a restaurant that wasn't even half full! I hope you bought enough of this new "crappy" placemat menu to go around to every chair until you close.

Sadly, I've removed this place from my Happy Hour list for the last time...

Please tell me the location down off Camelback didn't do this too.
