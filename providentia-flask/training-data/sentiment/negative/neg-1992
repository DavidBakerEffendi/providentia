My honest opinion...go someplace else for Chinese BBQ! The price and quality just does not match up.  

I ordered the char siu and the roasted duck, nothing was very memorable and the price was just too expensive for the amount I received.  After paying and picking up my bag, I was surprised how light it felt for the amount I paid.  

If you think I'm being "chang" (i.e. cheap), be my guest, go there and check it out yourself! 

Now onto the food.  One question, where is the flavor?  

One bite into the duck, nothing...just meat and fatty skin and the sauce over the duck, but no flavor within the meat.  Usually roasted duck should have a smokey flavor to it, this duck lacked it!  

Char siu (BBQ pork) was ok. Again, not much flavor and usually char siu has a real distinct flavor.  

All I can say is I am still on my quest to find the best Asian BBQ place in town!
