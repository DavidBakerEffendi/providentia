The food from this location has made me ill on more than one occasion. I don't think I will take my chances with Boston Pizza anymore. As for the restaurant itself, -it's an average Boston Pizza atmosphere, with fairly average service. The restaurant is newer and well kept... But doesn't redeem itself from the lousy, often undercooked food. Save yourself from getting food poisoning and go somewhere else!
