Food is good, not great, prices reasonable.  Service on the other hand is horrible.  Last time I ate there, the food came out cold and when brought to the attention of the waitperson, who by the way couln't be found for 15 minutes, she gave us the dear in headlights look and said "sorry".  That was it.  Highly suggest this restaurant get back to basics, because it seems to start at the hop.  The manager is just as bad.
