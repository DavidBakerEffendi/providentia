I went here more than once because I am usually in the area. 

I often crave for Thai express but all there times I have been I was not impressed. There self serve sauces are never refilled, also looks empty and the same when I see it, meaning they don't change the bottles? or clean them possibly, I mean this is based of the looks of it. 

The servers and cooks have no personality, I mean there is no customer service at all here, they look tiresome. 

The food is ok for a quick craving, I have had better, but this is also a fast food joint so you can't expect to much. I know for sure after I eat at this particular location my stomach feels the pains :(. 

I wish for high hopes for improvements because this is the quickest way for me to get my pad Thai fix when I am in the area.
