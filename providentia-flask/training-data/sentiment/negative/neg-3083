Came back to Woo Che recently on a Friday after we thought the $17 price was more reasonable compared to Sura ($24). Well, I was wrong because we were charged $19 per person that night.

When we first walked in the door, the place was almost deserted. There were only one other table (4 people) beside. When we left, we noticed only one more group came in after us and basically they were the only one there after we left. This is depressing for a late Friday night dinner joint.

Once we started eating the food, we realized why the place was almost empty. There weren't a lot of choices in term of food when compared with Sura. Most of the cooked food have been sitting out for a long time and didn't look fresh. The meat quality was low and again looked like it has been sitting out for a while. Overall the food experience were not good.

The service was nice, but again it could be because there were only a few people there. I felt bad for them because this place looks like it will have to close shop soon. I don't think you can maintain a business when only a few people dined at your joint on a Friday night. I hope I'm wrong and they will be successful again, so that way Sura don't have the monopoly and keep jacking up the price.
