I ate here with a friend as she raved about the place and how good it was. Needless to say, I had high expectations especially with my friend being a pig with food. (I hate the term, "foodie", it's for basic people).

We ordered the Butter Chicken and some roasted lamb leg and a bunch of garlic naan.

So she got her order and waited for like half an hour for mine. Forty-five minutes later, nothing. They must've forgotten my order even though you actually order at the counter. So, something was definitely wrong there. Oh to top the cherry off, we got an apology, that's pretty much it. I can tell the attendant can feel my wrath but she kept mum.

I got my food, AN HOUR later of waiting, and unfortunately, it was subpar. It was just okay. Hadn't I received such bad service to begin with, maybe I would've enjoyed it better, but no. 

We again ordered another garlic naan....... lemme tell you, GIRLFRIEND FORGOT THE ORDER AGAIN. And had the nerve to charge me for it still even though she forgot my order twice.

Sorry La Sani Grill, my money will never be spent in your establishment again.

PS. I do understand that reviews are subjective and unfortunately, I had a really bad experience.
