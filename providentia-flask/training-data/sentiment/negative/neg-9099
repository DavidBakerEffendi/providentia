Go here if you plan to go deaf while eating terrible sushi. It is obnoxiously loud, the service is terrible and the food is on par with the service.  Our waitress was running around like a jackrabbit without paying attention to anything. She messed up not one but three of our dishes (luckily we were at the bar so the guy who was making our sushi fixed it right away). The so called 'Japanese' food is made by mexicans who look to one white guy for guidance on how to make stuff. Yeah..not exactly authentic.
This was a big waste of time and money.  It gets a star because they had Sapporo beer.
