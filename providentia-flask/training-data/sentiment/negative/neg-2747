I think I'm about the only person who lived in Charlotte who is not a Cantina fan.  I've been there several times but I've always been disappointed.

Likes:  It's a fun atmosphere, buzzing with energy.  The margaritas and guac are good if you're willing to pay up for them.

Dislikes:  So expensive, even when they're running "specials" like about $18 for a pitcher of margaritas.  I had pork tacos one time: the food is sub-par and the quality is not great.  After that, I just got drinks there.  It's always packed, which can be good or bad depending on your preference.

Take it or leave it:  Leave it.  It's trendy but majorly over-hyped and over-priced.  I would expect better quality from a "fancy" Mexican place.
