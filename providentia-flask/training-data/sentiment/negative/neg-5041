If I could give a 0 I would. The person in charge was extremely rude bordering on scary. He was so nasty to the couple waiting ahead of us that when he barked at me for trying to read the blackboard menu we decided to just leave. Best decision ever!! Don't bother with this place. Instead go to L'oeufrier! Omggg so yummy, waitress servi e at the same prices and excellent friendly service. Why go somewhere where you are treated as if the staff are doing you a favor by letting you eat there?!
