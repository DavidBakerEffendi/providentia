Yiks this place needs a lot of work!! The food was so cold that the not so fresh fruit was warmer than it. The employees were so busy having fun with each other they forgot us and our food. The restaurant was so empty they should take a look at why. Staff should be thankful for the job. 
If you are visiting the strip and think Dennys is a safe place to eat because its a big chain than think again. We were sick with stomach problems that could only be Dennys as the cause. 
Go to a casino and take your chances there.
