This place is an absolute joke. The server was on her cell phone on a very dramatic (and loud I might add) personal call, making eye contact yet completely ignoring us. Having no other choice we stepped up to the counter & ordered. 
The quarter chicken I was served must have been on a hunger strike, it looked like nothing more than an oversized quail. I was done with the leg in one bite, the thigh was gone in two. It was also overcooked & dry, not to mention bland. The side dishes too were nothing to brag about. 
The people on here who gave this place 4 & 5 stars should have their taste buds checked. Better yet, I would advise them to go to Costco & spend $5.99 on a full rotisserie chicken & see if they ever go back to this dump. 
What a total waste of money!
