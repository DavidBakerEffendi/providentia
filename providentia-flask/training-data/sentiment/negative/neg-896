Still haven't played there, but tried.

The line is out the door and I'm there with my two kids for a little food and fun.  20 minutes of waiting outside -hot as heck at noon - we finally make it to the A/C.  At this point I get approached by a guy who informs me that "We are an irons-only facility".  I look at the golf bag I'm carrying - which belongs to my 8 year old son who, can hit it about 75 yards if he catches it all... but say, "OK, cool we won't use it.  No biggie."  Then I'm informed I need to return it to my car. " Really?"  "Yes" I also had a plastic Snoopy driver in there, should I leave that behind as well?  And you couldn't have told me that 20 minutes ago - oh wait the staff didn't want to be out in the hotness any more than I did.

I took it out to the car, kids with me, and left.  

Maybe I'll give it a shot again, but based on the goat-rodeo that was my first visit yesterday.  I really wanted to LOVE the place as the place in only 5 minutes from my office - wish I had enjoyed it more, or at least had a chance.
