I have to say there's an allure to Grace o malleys Central with live music. Staff seem personable and food was reasonable for bar food. we came for a stag party the waitress never said what she would do with the bill but the way service was handled we assumed they were going to group us all together.

Took a long time to sort out the bill and this was made abundantly clear that as customers that was our responsibility. I won't say thats necessarily a bad thing for everyone but i consider it bad service.
