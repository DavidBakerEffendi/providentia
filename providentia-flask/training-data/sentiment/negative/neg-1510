It's.so. Bad. When this place was on east blvd I only went twice and truly thought the food was not impressive. It's been at park rd shopping center now for a while and I have been several times in an attempt to give it another chance. Every time I go the food is awful. I tried 3 different tacos tonight and I couldn't even finish two of them, not to mention there was a random shrimp in one of them, which was an allergy hazard. Shelley was awesome, funny, personable and very sweet. Otherwise, in the future I will not succumb to a couples dinner here when suggested
