The soup I tried was okay --- mushroom and wild rice, but the wrap (pork shoulder) was just disgusting. The aioli was to sweet, the pork itself was dry, mealy and sort of gross. Not at all like REAL pulled pork as I've experienced it from Chipotle.

Overall, not a bad place to go.. for soups, I guess, but the wraps are less than awesome from what I've tasted so far.

To put it this way, I was starving and I didn't finish my wrap. I took 3 bites and threw it out.

I might go back and try the chowder just to be sure I really don't like this place, but I wouldn't recommend it.
