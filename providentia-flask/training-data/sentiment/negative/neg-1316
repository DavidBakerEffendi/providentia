Brutal:
Great location, great facility, clean bathroom.

The service was the worst I've had in years, maybe ever. It took 90 minutes from the time I entered the establishment to the time I left. I had a ceasar salad and a water.
How...?  How...?   How...?   Could this order take over 60 minutes to prepare. Most establishments want to turn over the table and get the next customer.

The salad itself was wilted and on par with fast food quality which is OK for 8 bucks, but not for 18.00.

I won't return until I've heard there is a change of management.
