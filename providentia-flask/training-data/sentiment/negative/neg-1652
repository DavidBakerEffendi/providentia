Had a late lunch at one of our favorite places today. It was not that busy but oddly enough it took nearly 20 minutes for us to get our soft drinks. The server Anastasia was not that busy. I spoke to the mgr Jaycee who found us a new server who did a great job, but here is why the review gets the low rating. Since the new server took over we consistently received dirty looks as well as the stink eye. This continued for about 30 minutes. We let Jaycee know this as well. For some to wear a shirt that says I love my job.... Did not see an attitude of service today.
