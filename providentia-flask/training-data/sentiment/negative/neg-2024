I was very disappointed.

The menu was quite limited, and many of the items were unappetizing to an American palateI had expected some American food as was promoted in a review of the restaurant by AzCentral:

Where are the burgers, curry, sandwiches, etc?  I had to choose from soup with blood in it, hog knuckles, and pig snout. I felt as though this was a menu of selections from an extremely rural and poverty stricken part of the Philippines. I don't want to sound ignorant, but when I was served the Chicken Tinola, with a single bony piece of chicken in a small cup of broth, and a pile of stark white rice, I was shocked. My husband, a fan of soul food, ordered pig knuckles and had to gnaw on a nearly meatless bone for his dinner. I sent back my meal and filled up on diet soda and the delicious putos. But we actually left hungrier than when we arrived and grabbed a Little Caeser's pizza because after spending $28 on a non-dinner (including tip because it wasn't the waitress' fault), our budget for dinner was deflated. 

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE a variety of Asian foods and I enjoy trying new things. But this experience strained that.

I would advise people to go there only for dessert. The Boba was very nice and the desserts looked delicious.
