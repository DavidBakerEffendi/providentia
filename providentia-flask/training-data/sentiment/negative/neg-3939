I'm not sure why people find this place appealing. Our table had 7 different entrees and the butchers plate. The entrees came well before the appetizer and the only one of them that was decently good was the hamburger. Way overpriced with mediocre service and unimpressive steaks and seafood. I would not eat here again, even if the prices were slashed in half
