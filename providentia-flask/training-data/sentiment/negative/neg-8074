I'm normally a big supporter of start up restaurants with new ideas and have to admire small restaurants that attempt to start in areas with so many options like this one. Having said that, first time I was at On-the-bun Burgers  I had a fairly good experience with the food they served. Was on point with different things on the menu. However, after going there for the second and third time, I started noticing things that really turn me down. For one, this place is on the pricy side... If you really want to try a good meal, you're in to spend at least a good $15-20 on one meal. This is not bad if you consider that you are about to have a gourmet burger, but then here's the biggest issue... This place takes no credit OR debit. They do have a shady ATM machine in the back, but I am not too comfortable getting anything out of it unless it was my very last resource... Would rather drive around and get money at a known ATM. Also another issue is the cleanliness of this place... It's very dated and not clean at all. The garbage disposal stations are just really bad. They have tiny little slots that are filthy and requires you to really push your left overs and papers inside... Not a good experience at all. Lastly, on our most recent visit, my friend had to take some meds before having his food, and asked the owner to have some water.... Was told that they don't serve water because they don't have cups and that he had to buy a bottle instead..... Seriously?? At a restaurant??
