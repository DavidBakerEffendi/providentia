Quick preface: Review should be a negative! 

There's a first time for everything. Yes that quote is a clich√©, but I think it suits what happened at this restaurant. We came in, were seated, drinks had been ordered and came quickly afterwards, but then nothing... After 45 minutes of waiting I politely went up to the counter and asked if they had forgotten about us, the waitress said that she actually doesn't work there (whatever that means - obviously she's working there) muttered something further but barely audible and snuck to the back. After another 20 minutes we decided that indeed we had been completely forgotten, so we got up and left. Like I said, "first time for everything".

Worst Service we've ever experienced. We were very proud that our two kids sat and coloured for the 65 minutes that we had sat there. 

I'm not one to not return to places because of a single incident or poor experience, but in this case I'm making an exception. I'm never returning to Humpty's again.
