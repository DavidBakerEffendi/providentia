I had a bad experience here. The food portions are very small. It's more like tapas sizes at entree prices. Also we received very poor service. Waiter was nice when you could find him but otherwise there was no service. We saw tables who were seated after us being served within a few minutes of being seated but we waited a good 25 minutes before getting our entrees. We were a group of four but the waiter managed to mess up our orders. One person wanted veggies in place of rice while the other wanted rice. When the plates came out, they both had veggies. When we brought it to our waiters attention he said the plates must have been switched. He took the plate from the table and got a plate from another table and have it to us. From working in food service, you never switch customers plates like this. The person could have coughed or sneezed on the plate or taken a bite out of it. It is food safety 101. You never take a plate back that has been served already and give it to another guest. Also, the yogurt sauce had a distinct acidic/bubbly quality which (if you know anything about food safety) means the yogurt has gone bad. We brought it to the waiters attention and he said that the lime in the yogurt dressing made it that way. Very disappointing. It's a nice ambiance and I'm sure most people have a decent experience but if you're willing to pay $30 an entree, this place is not worth the money by any stretch. Be smart and eat somewhere else.
