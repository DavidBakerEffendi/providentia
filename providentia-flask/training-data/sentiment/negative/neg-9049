Wanted to check out the revolving sushi theme, sounded good - quick and cheap, my kind of place. You can literally sit down and starting eating right away. However, the sushi was not very good. Barely even Chinese buffet grade. In fact, I'd rather get buffet sushi and other stuff for the price. The plates add up pretty quickly so value was not all the great really. I will say you do get to try a variety of dishes but the variety is not that extensive. Also, the service was good on the day we went. 

After a few plates, my daughter and I did not feel so well. Nausea lasted for a couple of hours. Not sure where the sick feeling came from with so much rice in the pieces? Anyways, I don't care how popular the place gets, you won't be seeing us again.
