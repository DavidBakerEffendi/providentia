I just arrived at Einstein Bagels and did not even get to ordering as I had been waiting in line and an associate approached the person behind me to take their order, and I kindly said "excuse me we were waiting next." The employee who I've now learned is named Fiona,  said "okay what do you want' I said we would like an egg sandwich with just egg no cheese,  she very curtly and with zero expression says" what kind of bagel " seemingly agitated.  I said you know what,  never mind.  And my kids and I walked out.  As I was getting into my car a fellow customer stopped me and said 'I just wanted to say I was watching and I'm so sorry you experienced such bad customer service that girl seemed so irritated to help you"  I said how very sweet of her to come out and mention it and she said I should complain (she is the manager of a nearby restaurant it turns out.) I went back in to mention it and make sure I got the associates name who had acted so irritated to take my order, and the woman at the register who was very friendly went to see if a manager was there.  She also walked over to Fiona and mentioned I had asked to speak to a manager about her,  Fiona rolled her eyes and turned around saying something.  I told the woman at the register that in the future Fiona might want to take customer's opinions of her more seriously as not only had I decided to leave without further ordering but another customer was also affected negatively.   Not a a good move,  we will not come back and doubt the other customer will either.  Only giving 1 star due to the kindness of the girl at the register.
