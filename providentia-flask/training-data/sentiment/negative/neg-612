I have always been a fan of AJ's although I admit I'm used to going to the ray rd location in Chandler. I regularly go for lunch for soup and salad. I've never once had a problem at that location. I've been to the Val Vista location twice now and both times I've had to wait for soup. I always call ahead to make sure they have a kind of soup I want. I came today for albondigas and arrived at 1145 am. They we're already out so I promptly let them know and walked around a little while then grabbed my salad. At 1215 I asked how much longer and was told 23 minutes, they hadn't started warming it. Are you kidding me??? Ive already waited 30 minutes. How are you not prepared to refill your soups at lunch? Especially when you know the albondigas goes quick. I guess if you want the soup you better be here by 11 or you can forget it. How extremely disappointing in such an upscale overpriced place. Stick to the AJs in Chandler because this location is totally incompetent.
UPDATE 1245 and they finally brought out the soup. It was enough for one serving. Unbelievable!
