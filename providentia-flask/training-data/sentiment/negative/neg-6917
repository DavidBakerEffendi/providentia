Came to Square One today w/ a friend. She wanted Chipotle and I decided to join her as I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I ordered a chicken and steak burrito. 

I really didn't think that their toppings were all that. The rice was just plain with no South American flair to it. Pico de Gayo looked like it was from yesterday. Don't get me started on what the beans looked like... Yuck.. What I was really surprised about was how un fresh it tasted and also that it wasn't warm. 

There hot sauce was not spicy at all for my liking but what really threw me was about after 30 mins my stomach started to churn in ways I'm not use to. I'm a lover of spicy food so I'm very suspicious as to what exactly my stomach reacted bad to.

People working there seemed friendly enough until I got to the end of the line where I had to pay but couldn't pay because they were too busy talking about their weekend and who would be working that day meanwhile they had a full line up.

I won't be back,.. Food is not all that at all...
