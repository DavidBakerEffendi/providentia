Unfortunately have to agree....we tried very hard to support this neighborhood yogurt shop, but it is not enjoyable.  It is fairly expensive, totally self-service, uncomfortable chairs, and yes, the surly teen cashier - all completed by a wonderful view of the Bashas' parking lot.   Sorry folks, hope you didn't cash out your 401 for this, just won't make it.  Needs something interesting or enjoyable to make it worth being a destination.
