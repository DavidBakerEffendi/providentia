The overall food was good taste wise but my stomach was full as just after I had one naan. Then I found out the reason being they added too much of (baking) soda in the food. In addition, the hotel staff was also not polite while talking. Even if we ordered starters first everything is served at the same time. So what's the meaning of appetizer? That was my first time and the last time I had been to this place.
