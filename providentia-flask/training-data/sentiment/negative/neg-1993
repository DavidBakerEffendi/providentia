No words! After a comedy of errors of having two restaurants closed on Monday in the neighborhood we ended up here. The outside of the restaurant gave us pause, but I wasn't in the mood to go find something else besides a fast food place, which there are ample in that neighborhood, we should have. This place has been around for ages so it must be good, right? Wrong! 

We ordered a 10 inch pizza with tomato and spinach, a cup of soup and a chicken parmesan sandwich. The waitress dumped the whole cup of soup in my lap when she brought it to the table. Granted, she apologized and I didn't make a fuss. She said she would not charge for the soup and brought a new cup. She charged for the soup anyway and I ended up with a dry cleaning bill. Great customer service it was not! 

My guest remarked that Campbell's soup was much better than what he was served. The soup was bland to say the least. I love pizza and this was not good pizza. The outside crust of my pizza was crisp, however when you picked up the pizza the slice immediately fell down, even when folding the slice. The bottom of the pizza towards the center was totally uncooked and soggy. I barely touched my pizza and left most of it behind. My guest's sandwich was a dry roll with very little sauce and the chicken. He ate the chicken and left everything else also. 

This was perhaps one of my worst restaurant experiences ever. I do not understand the ratings of others here, unless we got the amateurs at lunch and the real cook comes out at dinner time. I did not enjoy leaving the restaurant hungry, with tomato stains all over my pants and shirt.
