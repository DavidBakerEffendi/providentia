IT'S OFFICIAL. This restaurant does NOT live up to its name and the high rating of 4.5. You got to be kidding me.

There is NOTHING special about this place. Food is whatever. Service is nonexistent. Ambiance is bad. Interior/Exterior is crappy as hell.

I got my Black Bean Noodle with the sauce on the side. It was probably the worst Gan Jjajangmyun I've had in my life. It was very dry and the sauce was so thick like it looked really unappetizing as if someone actually puked. I am talking about the texture of the sauce and the noodle combination. Horrible. I ended up not eating. 

What's worst? Our bill was $21.51 and I had put $25.51. Never got my change back. Were they really expecting that I am going to tip them $4 for the service that wasnt even offered? I got so pissed on top of my food end up tasting like shit. I went up to the register and asked for my change. They already closed my check and had put $4 in the tip jar or the register. HOW RIDICULOUS IS THIS?

I am seriously not coming back here ever again. I didnt even want to come here in the first place today and I was so right on that.
