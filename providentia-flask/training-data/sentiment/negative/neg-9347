Not much to say. Went for dinner here since Buffalo Wild Wings had a long wait and we didn't have enough time. 

Since my boyfriend had work we didn't order adult beverages just a water with lemon and Pepsi/Coke. The drinks come out, surprise no lemon. (We stated lemon with the water, so it wasn't like an un-spoken request) whatever, we decided it wasn't worth a fight and went to ordering our dinner. I had a Tavern Burger, he had a Reuben. I also ordered a side salad to eat prior to my burger coming out. Once we placed our order, we did not see our waitress ONCE until after the food came out. I had been almost empty on my beverage for awhile at that point, and luckily with the food she ran and got me a refill. My salad didn't come out prior instead it came with, and was TERRIBLE. The croutons were stale, and the salad was soggy (like it had sat out in the dressing for way to long). My burger was fine, I feel as though it was small for $10, but whatever. My fries were cold. The Reuben made my boyfriend sick but he said the flavor was good, his fries also cold. 

We never saw our server again, until she dropped off the bill. So instead of complaining we paid and left and I don't plan on returning to this location. I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone, and don't see how people are raving about it.
