The worst food I've ever had.
First time at pickle barrel, and very disappointed.
I ordered the Original Jumbo Club House sandwich with the onion bun and avocado and a side of fries.Bun was not bad but not impressive, there's no sauce or anything at all, just mayonnaise on the side, and the fries were very stable and not even warm. But the part that really got me was the avocado. It was literally rubber! Super hard, I could barely poke my fork in it. And it tasted like rubber too.
The staff was quite nice, I asked them for a more ripe avocado, they brought me a bowl of new avocado. It was softer, BUT STILL RUBBER! Still very hard, and it actually tasted like rubber too. Absolutely no avocado taste, and some how water was dripping out of it when I bite it.
I have no idea what they did to the avocados to make them like that but I was completely disgusted.
I will never go back to pickle barrel again.
