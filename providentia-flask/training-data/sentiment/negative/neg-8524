The live music would be nice if it wasn't played over a speaker system that leaves your head pounding and your ears hurting. I sat down and ordered my drink, the waitress could barely hear what I was saying due to the music being so loud so I had to tell her 3x times I wanted a coke. She ended up bringing me a modelo. I ordered my food, the food came out wrong. I ordered a glass of water that I never got. The waitress never came back to our table until we had to run her down to pay our bill. This place is way over priced and the food is not all that great. The customer service was probably the worst I have had in awhile. Definitely won't be back!
