HORRIBLE experience... I am vegetarian so I ordered avocado curry with tofu. I picked up the food and when home only to realize that it had chicken in it. I called to let them know it had chicken so they agreed to make another curry for me.. Again when I came home to eat dinner -the tofu was cold inside, the vegetables were solid rock and cold and there was NO avocado to be found in my curry and the curry itself was runny and watery.... When I called to let them know - the guy who answered said "Sorry ma'am but it happens"... So I basically spent money on food I trashed... Disappointed and angry... Do no go here for a good dinner experience...
