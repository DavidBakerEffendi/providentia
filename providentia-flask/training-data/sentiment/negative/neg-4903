Been coming here on the weekends (either Saturday or Sunday morning) for the last three months and today's service was beyond horrible. Typically this is the place to get a reasonably priced breakfast without having to go inside a casino, but today is making me reconsider that endorsement. 
While we tend to come around nine, today we arrived before 8 and that will never happen again. Our food took over 30 minutes to arrive and when it did it was lukewarm and incorrect. The manager on duty didn't seem to be too concerned that the table that sat down after us got their food before us and had almost finished eating before she could tell us they were almost done cooking our food. I have a food allergy and need everything cooked in a pan with butter than on the grill but usually this does not add to wait time - today this was the reason it took so long according to the manager.
They did correct the incorrect dish (home fries ordered crispy and came out barely cooked) but did so by taking off the eggs and heating up the original home fries. This took five minutes and by then they topped the hot home fries with the cold eggs. The manager stated three times she would bring more decaf coffee but never did - thankfully another waitress did. To top it off the corrected dish had an additional garnish of a strand of hair. 
The attitude of the manager on duty only made this visit worse. She should focus on bartending because her managerial skills lack empathy and concern for the upset guest.
