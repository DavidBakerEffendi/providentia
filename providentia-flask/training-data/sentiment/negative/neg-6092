Meh. No macaroons. Cold standoffish worker seemed mad about something. Rolled his eyes multiple times and got angrier the more questions we asked him, even after we apologized explaining it was our first time here. It didn't really make sense, but the food, coffee, or hot chocolate wasn't worth going back to possibly receive an attitude with. Just stopped in on our way to Sadu, won't be returning. 

We ordered a lemon bar, a chocolate chip muffin, a small hot coco, and a medium decaf mocha coffee. Which came up to about $10.18 not really worth it.  I really wanted to like this place because it's on my way to school too. Darn.
