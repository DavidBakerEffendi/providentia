It says it opens from 5PM to 12AM so we went there at 11PM the first time but were told they don't accept order anyone(with pretty arrogant attitude)...Very disappointed but still we went there last week for the second time: Waffle was just so so and the drink was just soda with little fruit slice on the top..The spoons we were provided were blotted and we didn't even use them..They do provide 10% discount if you share their picture on instagram but in all this small benefit cannot offset their bad attitude and unimpressive at all.

Plus: Long waiting time alert: prepared for more than half hour of waiting time
