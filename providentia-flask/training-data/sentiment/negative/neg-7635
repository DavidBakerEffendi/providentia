This used to be my favorite neighborhood bar. I'd come here for happy hour many times a week. 

Well today they changed the menu and happy hour. 

They shortened it by an hour (now ends at 6pm) raised the price of the happy hour items. And took off the half priced wings during football games. 

I have been here for nearly every Monday and Thursday football games this season. Tonight will be my last. Good luck Half Moon.
