Really disappointed in our pizza.  We ordered take out tonight - one pepperoni and one margherita.  The total was almost 30 dollars and the pizza's were extremely small, AND the pepperoni pizza did not have any cheese on it.   We would have been better off going to Grimaldi's - they are a bit pricier but at least you get what you pay for!  Never going back here...which is a shame because it's a great location!
