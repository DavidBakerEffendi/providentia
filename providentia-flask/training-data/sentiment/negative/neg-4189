I thought the food was so bland and the variety was like going to Golden Corral. I've had a better buffet with varieties and selections in my town of Colorado, Blackhawk casinos. I will never come back and chose a Resturant instead. Not impressed for a big casino in Vegas -  I expected more. 

Sushi was listed at least 10 but six not even listed. The Italian was 2 main dishes. Yes - the meat was 4 selections. But even the special orders lady wasn't paying much attention to costumes. If it's 8 pm or 830 I'm still paying.
