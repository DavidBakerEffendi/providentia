This place is literally the most racist in Vegas. If you're black do not go here.. I have never been so out of place in my life . Majority of our tour group was in VIP and they refused us ..... there were NOOOOOOO black people in VIP and I don't think that was a coincidence. So like I said if you are looking for a good time and your black do NOT come here . You will be treated very poorly S
