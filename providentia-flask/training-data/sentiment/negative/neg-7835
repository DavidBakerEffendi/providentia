I find myself driving by this place a little too often and I always tell myself that I should stop on by one of these days. Well that day was today, I stopped by with my Great Dane whom is a licensed service dog and it was far from pleasant. Not only does the place lack personality and it could use some more furniture, but truthfully I can't even comprehend why anyone would want to stay and eat there since the customer service is beyond dissapointing. 
As I was asking the lady at the cashier some questions she had some slight attitude and after I ordered and paid for a Hula Acai bowl she said, "due to the health department regulations you can't have your dog in here so you can wait outside with him and I'll bring out your bowl". Not only did her comment and the tone  infuriate me but it also made me feel belittled, obviously my dog is a service dog which you can identify by the tag and his behavior as he just sat still next to me the whole time I stood there. I went ahead and just waited outside anyway because at that point I didn't even want to see her, so after 10 minutes she comes outside and brings me my bowl, with no lid on it, honey was dripped all over the side and I was not given a bag. If you make a customer wait outside for the food they ordered the least you can do is bring them a lid and a bag. 
-the ingredients used were low quality so the actual bowl is not worth $8.00
