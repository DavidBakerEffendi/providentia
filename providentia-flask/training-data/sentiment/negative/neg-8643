There is not one nice thing I can say about this place.  And, I'm trying to think of one...believe me.

We went for dinner last night, and were there early.  There were only two other tables in the whole place.

We ordered buffalo wings, which came out fried with spice on them, but no sauce whatsoever.  We asked for buffalo sauce, as noted in the menu, and the server shrugged and said they didn't have any.  Um, OK.

50 minutes went by from the time we ordered, and our entrees came.  DH had a meatball sub, I ordered chicken parm.  My chicken parm was cold.  It was cooked through, but had been prepared far earlier than it was served, and had been nuked.  His sub was blazing hot.  We both felt the kitchen screwed up, as waiting 50 minutes with no one in the place was strange.  Regardless, I wasn't comfy eating cold chicken, so, it got sent back.  

The d√©cor is also super depressing.  The servers move beyond slowly and are inattentive.  There is just some strange negative vibe in this place, and I couldn't wait to get out.

Still, our wings, two drinks, and his sub cost us $42 with tip.  Ridiculous.
