Worst chinese food I ever had .
The food is so greasy or dry ! 
Mongolian beef was swimming on oil like sause with drenched vermiceli  on the bottom. 
Chicken friend rice was so hard and dry that we didn't even eat  it while very hungry. 
How can you crew up friend rice ??? Unless it was made 3 days ago! 
Hot and sour soup  was so sour ,no joke ! And I ordered it in so many other places but this one is just not edible ! 
Do your stomach a favor don't make it suffer !
