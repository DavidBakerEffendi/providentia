I'd like to start off by saying that I am middle eastern and this is the worst restaurant I've been to. The smell when you walk in is straight rust! This place feels like it's straight from the 80s, I almost barfed! I was in disbelief when I saw their outrageous prices for the food that I know does not take much to make. No way the owners can be middle eastern, as it would be a disgrace to serve this kind of food that has been sitting in the fridge for weeks! Think about it, there's not a lot of traffic here and they can't afford fresh food! Beware!
