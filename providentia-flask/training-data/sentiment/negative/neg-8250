Wanted to try this place for the first time and the hostess was too busy flirting with a group of young boys to even notice us standing there waiting to be seated. Horrible customer service!  We no longer have the desire to even try this place. If the hostess won't even acknowledge your presence I can only imagine what the rest of the service would be like. If I could give zero stars I would.
