I'm going to begin by saying this, Woonam Jung is not very good. I can think of at least 5 places better than Woonam Jung. 

Why do people give this place 4 or 5 stars? I'm only assuming they haven't traveled much and so their taste buds don't know any better. 

The service that I experienced recently was horrific. We waited 1 hour to be sat with only 1 party ahead of us. We saw 8 groups of people leave during that hour that we waited. I looked inside and noticed no one clearing off and cleaning the tables to turn them as soon as possible for new diners.

Once we finally got sat. Our server asked us " How long did you guys wait?" 
I responded "One hour."
He responds "Its good that you waited because the service will be better now. We were so busy that people didn't get the right service from us."
I responded "cool"

15 minutes into our meal... I ordered more kalbi from that same server. We waited 15 minutes until another server noticed that our cooking pan was completely black and smelled like burnt meat / vegetables. I'm livid at this point and have no patience with any of their staff. 

I hate people that don't live up to their words and end up giving you a half assed apology and think thats okay. It's not okay, give a sincere apology and don't EVER promise good service if you aren't capable of delivering. 

Meat - 3/5 stars
Soups - 1 / 5 stars
Service @ half full restaurant - 1/5 stars

I recommend you to stay away from this place and go to DJK for Korean BBQ.
