Horrible, will not go back! This was our first time here since they changed from the original Johnny Rockets. It's a poor copycat version of Five Guys/Smash Burger. The cost per person for a double burger (frozen patties) with cheese was over $8. This included these skinny lil French fries.  If they want to charge gourmet burger prices they need to have quality food! The burgers at Five Guys, Smashburger and Culvers are much better. They also need some quality fries, not shoe strings. The new atmosphere.... has no character at all, the old theme was enjoyed many. The old fashioned diner theme is hot right now so I don't understand this change. We won't be back!
