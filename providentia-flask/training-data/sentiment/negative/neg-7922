The food was ok. The restaurant is beautiful. The staff was awful. When arriving early for an online order I was told they could not go ahead and make the food, they didn't offer to go ahead and give me a drink. After watching people who arrived 15 minutes after me receive their food in under 5 minutes I clearly did not understand what the issue was with making mine early. The pump for the ketchup was broken and left a mess. When trying to show my screen to verify my order instead of shouting my number across a loud kitchen, the cashier insisted I continue to yell. Overall everything except the staff was great.
