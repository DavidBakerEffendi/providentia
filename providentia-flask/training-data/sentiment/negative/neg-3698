Terrible. Every single person in line was pissed and complaining. Since this is Chipotle style service, why not finish up one order before jumping to the next? The girl was so rude when another customer told her to remake the quessadilla that had been sitting there cold for 15min already. Not to mention, it was burned. Our food took forever and she rushed through the order. It too was cold when we actually sat down to eat. The tortilla was already soggy. And damn the steak was nasty. Chewy, Beef jerk like meat that had more fat and tendons than anything.
