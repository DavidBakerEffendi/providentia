shitty shitty shitty . got my plate of beef broccoli with steamed rice & my steamed rice had an ant in it . but i figured it's just an ant & took it off my plate & continued to eat . had fried rice & it was anything but fried . it was literally just rice w/ a bunch of soy sauce dumped in it .  THEN TO TOP IT OFF i went & got pink lemonade ... it was orange & didnt taste like lemonade at all , so i got water out of the machine thinking "hey how can they mess up water.. took a sip of it & guess what.... IT WASNT WATER . it was carbonation from the soda . very disappointed . i usually dont take time write out reviews but DAYUM . altho my experience wasnt all bad , their restroom was clean
