Wish we would've read the yelp reviews before wasting our time and $. So sad that the quality of food is terrible! Hostess seemed perplexed rolling her eyes when we asked for the corner booth that was empty. Husband ordered turkey meal. No flavor other than the extra salt they added to make it tast "okay". I had 1/2 sandwich with soup. Sandwich had the end of the tomatoe stem lol with one small piece of very poor quality bacon. Took a piece of pie to go. The pie crust was stale!  Owner/Manager needs to wake up! Contact corporate and buy higher quality food! Village Inn was known for their pies but they have gone downhill. Dissapointing!
