I feel like C'est Bon has been around forever and yet I'd somehow never tried it before. We were looking to order some Chinese food for dinner one cold November night and I figured the time was right to finally give this place a shot.

Big mistake.

We ordered three items:

Home-Made Egg Roll: This basically tasted like a frozen egg roll you'd buy at the supermarket. There were no distinct flavors or textures contained within, and the filling all came out on the first bite. Some kind of sauce might've helped but all that was provided were a few generic packets of plum sauce.

We moved onto the mains hoping for an improvement. No dice.

Sweet and Sour Breaded with Fresh Pineapple: This was dominated by the garden-variety and very familiar sweet-and-sour taste one associates with sweet and sour chicken balls. It's as though they took a whole jar of that sickly-sweet concoction and dumped it into a bowl of breaded chicken. It was pretty nasty, actually. Making matters worse, the chicken was completely soggy from swimming in that sauce.

C'est Bon Spicy Chicken ("One of our own creations and one of our best sellers"): If this is one of their best sellers, I'd hate to see what does poorly on their menu. This really had virtually no flavor whatsoever, and it goes without saying that not a hint of spice was to be found. The chicken was mushy and the veggies were forgettable. What on earth would possess any restaurant to serve a dish this terrible?

So yeah, needless to say we shan't be ordering from C'est Bon again.
