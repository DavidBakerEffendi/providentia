First visit last night,I really wanted to love it .I didn't love it,  actually I thought it was awful and sent back the entire dish. Staff was adequate,didnt really seem to care that we sent back two pasta dishes with one bite taken out of each. I ordered pesto with broccoli and mushrooms,the dish came out with what I can only describe as a thick dark coating,it was way to thick to be called a sauce and certainly didn't taste like pesto. I wont be going back.
