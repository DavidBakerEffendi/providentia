It's very tempting to want to go here on a game day, but you are better off tailgating with KFC.  The service isn't that bad for being such a busy place, I mean there is a line out the door & a significant wait, but the food is really terrible.  You could complain, but I don't think it would get any better.   The goal is to feed & water the masses, and that it does, but you will leave a bit disappointed.
