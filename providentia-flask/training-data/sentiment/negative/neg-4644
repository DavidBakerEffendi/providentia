This was hands down the worst dining experience I have EVER had. I chose this restaurant to celebrate a dear friend's 30th birthday because I had read numerous positive reviews online.

The hostess who answered the phone was courteous and professional and we were able to get a prime reservation on a Saturday night. The good stopped there. 

Our server was unbelievably rude and unhelpful with the menu. His only obvious desire was to up-sell us on all of the choices we made. I understand the desire to up-sell, but there is a way to do this in a genuine less greedy manner. I would have ordered more drinks if he had even bothered to check on our table, but that seemed to be above him.

The seaweed salad arrived and it was both mushy and very under seasoned.

Then, the real culinary horror arrived: a plate of sushi samba's signature sushi rolls. One roll was topped with burnt foie gras that also tasted a rancid. I mentioned it to the waiter the one and only time he came to check on our table and he told me that, "Everyone else really likes that roll. I'll have to talk to my manager." ummmm???  Why wouldn't you offer me something else from the menu? Why would you let a patron leave dissatisfied?

And that was the last time we ever saw him. It was as though we had offended him and for the rest of the evening he completely ignored us. We waited over 20 minutes for our check to come after the table had been cleared.  I almost got up and left. What an insult to have chosen a restaurant for such a special occasion and then to be treated so poorly.

I would like to note that the bussing staff was excellent. They provided seamless clearing of our plates and refilling of our water.

All in all, Sushi Samba I hate you for ruining such a special night.
