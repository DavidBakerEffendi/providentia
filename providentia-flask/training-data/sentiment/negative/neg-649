This place sucks! We came to take our daughter to see the mermaids and scout it for future stays in Vegas. While we were waiting for the mermaids to come out, my husband went to play some poker at the bar. He put in some money and the bartender came and comped him a drink. Then mermaid came out just then so my husband cashed out and came over to watch our daughter. The bartender then came to him and gave him a bill telling that he needed to pay for the drink he was comped because he didn't play enough rounds!? WTF! What kind of scam is that! He admitted in front of me that he changed the bill! My husband paid for the drink, but still questioned the practice. Wondering if the was some kind of scam being pull on him. The bartender call the manager and we went through the whole thing for them. Not only the managers, but a full contingent of security was brought out to us! All of this in front of my 2 year old! Over a f ing drink! We were treated like we were about to throw down or something with my 2 year old hanging off my hip.
