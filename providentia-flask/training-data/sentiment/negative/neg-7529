This place is horrible, from the moment I stepped foot in the establishment to the very last interaction I had with the waitress - I was left with a bad taste in my mouth and it wasn't just from the biscuits and gravy.  I was in Vegas for work, every moment of my down time was spent at the Wynn property and I cannot say enough great things about my overall experience at this hotel - the room was beautiful and the casino is very well organized and great.  With that being said, the experience I had at this cafe this morning will likely result in me never giving Wynn another dime.  I gambled all night on Tuesday 3/8/16 @ the Wynn and as a result the casino host comped me and my business partner our breakfast at the terrace point cafe.  As soon as I walked in I found myself waiting in line to be seated in a pretty much empty establishment, literally waited patiently for 5 minutes for whatever reason is unknown to me.  Upon seating, it took at least 10 minutes to get our beverages, my water was never topped off.  Numerous employees walked by my empty water several times.  At one point I got up out of my seat and walked over to the bar to get my water refilled myself, the bartender proceeded to key punch something in the computer and didn't even look up at me or greet me even though I was hovering and in obvious need of assistance.  When I finally interjected, he didn't even let me say what I needed and told me that he'll "be right back" with an annoyed tone.  The food was just mediocre, nothing special.  The steak I had with my eggs was extremely fatty for a strip and was very thin, the biscuits and gravy are an outright abomination. Given the fact that this eatery is located on the Wynn property, I figured it would be paired with a "Wynn" level of service, I was wrong.  It's a shame that this experience is going to lead to me having to find a new favorite casino/hotel when I venture to Vegas in the future, get it together!
