We came here for my brothers birthday party. Oh God they had the worst customer service. First of all, my friend and her mother came along and order chips and salsa and the waitress said "oh we are out." She didn't even apologize or anything then we asked for water and the water tasted horrible!!!! We told her the water tasted horrible and she said " well let me check if we have bottle water." Her face expression was horrible. Never coming to this place again! !!
