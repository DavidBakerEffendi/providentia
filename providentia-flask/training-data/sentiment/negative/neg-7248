My son had the fish tacos and the fish was delicious. The cabbage was bitter because it was from the part of the cabbage that you are not supposed to use - near the core. The rice was mushy, however the beans were okay. I had the chicken burro enchilada style and the chicken was boiled and dry. The enchilada sauce was bland and my rice was also mushy. The service was very slow. It took 30 minutes to get our food and there were only 5 other tables with customers. The chips and salsa were tasty and while waiting for our food I squeezed lime juice over the chips and added a little salt - that was tasty.
