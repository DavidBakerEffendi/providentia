I normally only go on yelp to write reviews of places that are amazing but I am so disappointed with my experience at this Pei Wei location that I needed to post this. I order the same exact thing every single time: the honey seared chicken with brown rice and four crab wontons. This time I received the chicken soggy with the breading falling off and zero sauce on the chicken. The brown rice was burnt and the wontons tasted like they were a day old. My boyfriend got the chicken fried rice and half of the rice was still white meaning they did not mix the soy sauce through out. All of the vegetables were raw and there was little to no flavor. Needless to say it will be a very long time before we try eating at Pei Wei again.
