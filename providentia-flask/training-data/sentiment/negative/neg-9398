I've been here a few times and it's a little slow, but the last time I went did it for me. I will not return to this location anymore. It was around 7:30pm and was pretty empty inside, maybe four customers total. There was no line at the counter so you would think I would be taken care of pretty fast. The cashier and other employees were behind the small door that separates the kitchen from the counter. The cashier clearly saw me standing there and continued her conversation with the rest of the employees. I stood there for a few minutes waiting to order. All of the employees had seen me and completely ignored the fact that I standing there waiting to order. Truly it is not hard to take an order and then continue your conversation. I realized the food was not worth the wait since it's not that good to begin with. Overall it was just rude to ignore the that somewhere was there waiting for them to finish their conversation.... therefore I left since no one ever came to the cash register to help me
