Unbelievably bad service.  I had called and ordered a roast turkey breast to be picked up on 12/22.  I was given a number (6).  I was in line outside t he store for 1 1/2  hours and then another 1/2 hour in the store.  No one asked for the number.  Several people in line around us were surprised that those of us who had a number weren't asked for it.  We ordered it ahead of time and we all assumed we'd be in and out quickly.  Two hours on a cold day in December is not quick.  The store was crowded (probably the fire department would not have been happy with the number of people in the store).  I don't know if the other stores are like this but I can guarantee you that I will never come to this store again - ever!
