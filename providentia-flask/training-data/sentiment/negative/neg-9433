As a regular restaurant goer (10-12 x Month)...I've come to anticipate a certain level of food/service from Toronto area restaurants. This restaurant delivered neither! This Fionn MacCools Rest was terrible. Our waitress argued with us over the food quality & stated that "Yelp means nothing"! We had the Blarney Fries which were cold & undercooked the 1st time around & not nearly hot enough the 2nd time. Also ordered the Warm Mushroom salad w Chicken. This was tasteless & bland. My wife had the Beet Salad which had only a trace of Beets. This was a totally unimpressive restaurant that does not deserve to have us spend our hard earned dollars at!! Avoid...avoid...avoid!
