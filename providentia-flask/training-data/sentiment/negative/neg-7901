Oh My! where do I start?  The 3 sales associates that are sweet,kind and helpful must be recognized for their grace and class....But, I really wish this store would be shut down.  Rude,offensive,inappropriate and snotty is all I can say.  

When I was pregnant...and wandering SFS aimlessly to get away from the 110 degree weather...a SA commented that I should check to make sure I was not carrying triplets....another SA comments that she does not know what she will do with the HUGE commission she will make by selling me a 50$ Theory t-shirt.  Another associate refused to set aside 2 pairs of Prada shoes because she wanted the commission right now...not later...she was trying to screw my regular sales girl out of the sale...in turn she screwed NM out of a sale all together.   

I wrote a letter to their HO...got a call from the VP...who commented "Well. we can't hold our Sales Associate's hands ALL THE TIME!"...are you kidding me????? He did say that he would discuss each incident with the mentioned SA....Yes. I wrote down names...AND Dates.

But seriously, to refuse a return because you are going on break???? and to act like it MY FAULT for disturbing your glorious day at work? 

Get with it Neiman's!! this store is liability and so many out their would LOVE to have a job and would be glad to be helpful and kind to a customer.

I would love to see that store turned into a COSTCO just like PV Mall...it's just what NM deserves.  The 3 SA's that do NOT deserve my scorn....go work for a company that makes people feel Beautiful,Happy and well taken care of....
