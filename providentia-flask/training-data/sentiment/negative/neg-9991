No one was at the door to greet me. I had to walk around the WHOLE restaurant to find my husband. Then when I got to the table, they said I couldn't order lunch chicken parmesan. The manager came over, and said it herself. Funny how ive come and gone to several olive garden and only order that. Im a go to dish type of person. What a Terrible manager!!!!! And waitress.
