On February 3rd 2017 my wife and I  checked into the Vanition hotel. 
When we prepared the room for departure I personally placed my wife diamond earrings on the nightstand, then I called my wife which was in the bathroom getting ready and told her that the earrings are on the nightstand, she assured me she will put them on as soon as she would get out of the bathroom. 

However she didn't.

3 hours later she remembered she didn't take the earrings off the nightstand, we called one of our friend to go to The Venetian and try to recover them.
My friend got to the room escorted by hotel  security officer and they saw the maid in the room cleaning.
My friend went to the nightstand and the earrings wasn't there, the maid claimed she didn't see any earrings.
The officer then asked the maid to check all over the room and she didn't find them anywhere.
I can understand someone may say well maybe the guest forgot them elsewhere maybe it was not left and maybe maybe maybe, however I know 100% it's not the case I left them on the nightstand and my wife did not pick them up so there is only one option!!!

The official response of the Venetian to my claim is in the attached letter. 

After reading it you will come to the same conclusion as me which is don't forget nothing in the Venetian!!!
