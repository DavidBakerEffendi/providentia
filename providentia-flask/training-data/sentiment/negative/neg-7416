So I've been living in the Yonge and Eglinton area for about two years now. When I first moved in, I ordered a pizza from Gino's and was extremely disappointed by the quality. I figured maybe they were having an off night, so I didn't write them off completely.

Last night I finally decided to give them another shot, and the quality was just as bad (if not worse).

I ordered a large pie with bacon, sausage, onions, tomato, and mushroom. When I arrived to pick it up, it wasn't ready - which is fine; I'm happy to wait a bit if it means I get a fresh pizza. (I should note that the interior of the store is actually pretty filthy and gross. Don't they ever clean up in there?)

So I get the pizza home and excitedly take the first bite. It's terrible. The cheese and toppings are mediocre at best, but the real issue here is the sauce. Or the lack of sauce, I should say. There's so little on the pizza that it's basically non-existent. (This is the same issue I had the first time I ordered.)

It's hard to imagine something less appealing than a dry pizza. You're basically just eating subpar melted cheese on doughy bread. It hardly even *qualifies* as a pizza. And I'm no pizza snob, either. But this... I'm just at a loss for words. How do you mess something up something so simple to this degree? It really does take a special kind of incompetence.
