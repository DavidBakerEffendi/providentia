Super long line at the drive through so I park and go inside despite the pouring down rain as I was craving a bagel and cream cheese. I try to order and find out they only have ONE kind of bagel left, multigrain. What kind of Starbucks only offers one kind of bagel? Girl at counter tells me that, ignores me and waits on the next customer. This place is by far the worst Starbucks I have ever stepped foot in. I will never return!
