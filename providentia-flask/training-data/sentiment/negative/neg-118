I was so disappointed and pissed after eating here. I don't remember what we ordered since it was awhile ago, but what did it for me was the fact that these a**holes sent the bus boy to come after us when we left because they thought we did not leave a tip. FIRST OF ALL, we did leave a tip, but their sub par service did not even earn 10%. We gave them a tip that fit the service we received, and was not cheap at all. They were requiring a 15% tip. WTF we told them that they definitely did not deserve 15% and how dare they expect it. We were a table for 2. It's not like we were a group of 8 or more where they like to tack on an automatic 15% or what not. All I remember was how pissed my BF and I were vowing we WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS SHADY place!!!
