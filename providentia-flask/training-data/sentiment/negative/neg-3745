Our experience at Thailicious was anything but -licious. We arrived, a party of four, for an early Sunday evening dinner. We were greeted with delay, as the host was also the primary cashier for every other party present. The host eventually got around to acknowledging our presence and seated us. Again, with about a 10 minute delay, our drink orders (simply water and wine) taken; and as the waitresses/host/cashier urged us to order all dinner items too, we did that in a rush. The drink orders did not come in a timely manner, many ingredients were missing from the bar, and we had to remind the waitress of what we ordered. It took about 35-40 minutes for the dinner entrees to arrive, which were tasty, but again, wrong.  An order of brown rice suddenly turned into an order of white rice, and the seafood portions were pathetic for the price. Bottom line: not coming back here again. Don't waste your $$$.
