I have eaten middle eastern food all over Toronto. Came here for lunch and ordered a simple Swarma. While waiting out of curiously I looked here and was surprised at the low scoring reviews. Then my sandwich arrived and I realized my wife and I had different toppings (but I hadn't ordered any of my toppings). Not the end of the world and I was hungry so I didn't say anything and my sandwich was okay. My son didn't like the pickles or beets and picked his out. It is just odd that when u publish toppings on the menu you don't ask what people want and unless this is the McDonald's of middle eastern food that is just weird. Service was horrid and the waitress that only had a few tables obviously had no training. Then somebody burnt bread in the kitchen which is not pleasant but to make matters worse I saw the owner or manager on duty spraying febreeze at the front door. Weird again but then he started walking by my table and a few others and spraying. My family was done but someone who just got their food must have given him a dirty look as he apologized and stopped. I have been to other paramount locations and this one is an embarrassment. Next time I will go to a smaller family owned shop and make sure I decide what is on my sandwich.
