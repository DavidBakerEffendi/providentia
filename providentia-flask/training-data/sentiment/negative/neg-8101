This was a HORRIBLE place to eat. The food was the best part but that's not saying much.  The restaurant itself is a nasty 80's salmon pink hue with chandeliers trying to be something it's not.  It looks like it is, a hotel restaurant.  
First off, they screwed up our reservation.  They had us as a no show for 5 o'clock but we came in on time for our 8 o'clock reservations.  The place was only half empty and they acted as though they'd have to scramble to find us a table.  They finally sat us and didn't give us a menu until we asked.  We also had to ask for a drink menu.  We came for restaurant week so the menu was limited but it sounded so good (hence why we came).
The food was completely forgetable and generic.  Not worthy of the time, money or calories.  They also had run out of many items on the menu, which the waitress said "This is our first restaurant week, and we didn't know what to expect."  I can't even remember what I ordered it was that bad and forgetable.  Will never come back.
