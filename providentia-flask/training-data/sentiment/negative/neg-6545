Don't come to this place without reading the reviews! Sincerely! 
I have never been such a restaurant with this bad service! The owner is so aggressive and he made you to order the dishes you don't want. The food is not bad but it makes feel bad because they made you to order and pay. You will have to pay dishes you never orders at the end with 18% tips included. 
How come they are still open after so many 1 star reviews?
