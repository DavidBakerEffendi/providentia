Very Disappointed tonight at this Spot! My Family and I came here to have dinner the food was Great. Our server Bill was Not! This was our first time here and we were a party of 6 . We heard about this place how they treat you Like Ass Holes and that they make hats out of butcher paper and write stupid shit. So we were like let's Go! Well, only 3 of my family members got a hat and the rest didn't.  Bill was quick to give us our tab. So we thought ok maybe he will do our hats after we pay. Nope!!! I'm a Foodie Person I'm always out and about to try New Spots and if I Get Amazing service you as a Server Get a Amazing Tip. Well, tonight Bill got what he deserved as a Tip $20.00 bucks. For what our tab came out to be Bill should of received about $40.00 bucks. So to end this review I will Never recommend or Ever come to this Place Again.
