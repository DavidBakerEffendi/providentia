Horrible!! They advertise on the menu you can mix the flavors. When we asked for some combined the waiter told us we can't, confused with his attitude he was giving us waiting forever for drinks poor poor service!! We asked to speak with the manger! She gave even more attitude, about everything. We asked how come we can mixed flavors as it says you can on the menu, her response was that they don't have enough bowl to do so. First thing that came to mind was well you have a dishwasher???!! She shrugged it off. There was 2 other tables not like they where busy. I could see if they where busy not washing there dishes or waiting an hr for a drink. The manger should not be in the position she is in to say the least excuse after excuse rude and very bitchy. To top it off the food was very salty that's all you could taste in most the flavors. For having wings as the main thing wasn't impressed by far the worst wings I have tried!
