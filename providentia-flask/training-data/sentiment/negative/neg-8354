Terrible. Horrible. No A/C, the guy actually got on the PA and told customers to bus and clean their own tables. Took 30 minutes to get my order. Food quantity was small. Place felt dirty. Overpriced. And the guy refused to give cups out for water. If the guy at the cash register stopped chatting so much and actually worked, things might be better. Avoid at all costs.
