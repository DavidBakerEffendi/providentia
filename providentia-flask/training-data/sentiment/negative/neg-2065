If i could give 0 stars i would.  I just left here with some coworkers and not one of us was happy with our pizza.  3 of us purchased the thai chicken pizza.  The pizza had so much cilantro you could barely taste anything else.  

To top everything off , when i bit into my second slice of pizza the chicken still had a decent sized bone , STILL IN IT.   To give them credit , they did comp my pizza and did keep the ice tea flowing , but honestly i will never visit this location again.  

Ive had way better "upscale" pizza at CPK ( California Pizza Kitchen)

Ambiance 4\5
Server 3\5
Food 0\5
Cost 0\5.

Ive chewed 2 pieces of gum and still taste cilantro & 
free choking hazard with every purchase act now !
