6/8/2014:  YOU CAN NOT BLACKMAIL INTO WHAT I DO AND DON'T SAY.  YOUR SERVICE AND RESTAURANT SUCK.  PLAIN AND SIMPLE.  You claim you wrote me; yet I never got the email.  Anyway can "fake" sending an email.  

I called.  I called.  I called.  YOU NEVER CALLED ME BACK.  Messages "were taken" - my 24/7 cell phone number was left with my messages.  When I asked the message taker to repeat my number to me I was told "I have it... no problem" and they hung up.  WHICH MEANS - 9 times out of 10, they NEVER WROTE IT DOWN!!!!  I was probably speaking to you.  And that's when I contacted home office.  YOU CAN NOT IGNORE PEOPLE - and if you do - you lose business and customers.  LIVE WITH YOUR DECISION.....  

I can't believe the home office even allows you to use their name.  This is a huge HUGE reflection on their part.  As well as trying to talk with me about the problems we encountered.  Blasting me on Yelp --- it's AMERICA bud - and I can say what I want and when I want too. 

Everything I said was TRUE - Believe it or not.  I don't care.  But other people out there WILL CARE - infact - check out my wall.  Two friends read my review of your crappy service and cold food and said they would NOT NOT NOT ever eat there.

I hope your doors close - you deserve it.

Laura,
We responded to your complaint on September 3rd you never reached out to us but you did reach out to yelp to post a negative not true review.You then wrote the general office telling them we never reached out to which we then provided a copy of our email to you. The email is obviously correct because you just emailed us and I am again responding to you. I found your review to be very incorrect and out of line on the truth and again you just posted another review stating we never contacted you which isn't true. I will not respond again to you after your fraudulent review you have posted yet again and will contact yelp with the appropriate documentation on why your review is fraudulent. If you would like to take down your review and discuss with us then the issue you have with our place we will then be happy top do so.
