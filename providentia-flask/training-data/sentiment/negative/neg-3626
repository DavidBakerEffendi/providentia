I've been getting the half-chicken combo for more than 10 years and just ordered a chicken sandwich thinking it would be a filling snack. Nope. A .50c bun and a leg's worth of chicken for $7.00 + tax. The sandwich looked pretty bare and I asked for lettuce & tomato and was told it would be $1.00 extra. Come on guys! Definitely stick to the combos for the best value.
