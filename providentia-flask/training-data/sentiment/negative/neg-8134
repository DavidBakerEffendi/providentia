I don't get it.  Highest rated restaurant in this area??  Do not be suckered.  Service was poor with zero personality.  No water was served or even offered.  Wine served in a cheap juice glass.  Only two beers on the menu, two.  Oily Caesar.  Pizza was okay.  People review this place like they've never had a wood fired pizza before.  Trust me, go to il Capo up the street for a better experience in every way.  Or even Gramaldi's.  Yelpers, you are often right on, but you let us down this time.
