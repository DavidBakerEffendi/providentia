I went into every other casino and they were all closing up shop. This was it. I had the turkey club. Really it was nothing I would ever order again. Not that I would come back here. When I went to pay the bill. Our waitress kept stretching her neck to see what kind of a tip I was leaving. When I handed the receipt to the cashier, this broad was bent over the counter. Are you kidding me. Oh! Get me odda this place.
