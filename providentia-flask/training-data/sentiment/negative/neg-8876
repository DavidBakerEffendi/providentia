Can I give zero stars? I didn't even get to eat. As soon as we walked in the cashier looked at us and walked in the back and never came back out. The cooks were outside smoking and gossiping about the night before's drunk. This was at 6 pm. Prime dinner time. The tables were all dirty. The visible part of the kitchen was messy and cross contaminated. Overall, we were flagrantly ignored. We left after ten minutes of non-service. I was very sad because I had heard such good reviews and the menu looked good, but the facilities were sketchy.
