I call and placed an order of pupusas and Guatemalan tamales, my friend went to pick them up.
Bad experience, the tamales where not Guatemalan, no flavor at all and the pupusas where also not good, and the size of a quarter, very small, not good at all,.
     I,m not going back!!  The prices are very high!!
