Ordering from Yummy Yummy was a waste of money.  First of all everything smelled and tasted like fish, although there was no fish in our order. My bet is that the oil they fried our chicken and wonton was not the best quality and probably been used thousand times before. Trying their egg drop soup was an exciting experience. Eating a jelly that tastes like chicken, well that's something everyone should try once. But only once. Be warned folks.
