DISGUSTING!! WORST INDIAN FOOD EVER!!!! And I eat a lot of Indian food.....Don't let the ambiance and the friendly service fool you. When you get down to it and have questions about the details of items on the menu..... they don't care to answer questions about their food and I soon learned why. I ordered veggie dishes, my partner the typical tika masala. I inspected my food and it had the weirdest smell......After asking questions, we found out this place does not specialize in making fresh food with quality ingredients. Much of the food is processed and comes from cans and containers. I was told directly by my server that the eggplant in the baingan bharta was from a can! I have heard it all. Who the heck uses eggplant from a can in an Indian restaurant? Oh the people at Origin India. Who would have THUNK a fresh dish like baingan bharta could stand up with such yuckiness with someone who knows better?  OMG it was so digsusting. It looked like vomit on a plate. And it smelled like some dangerous chemical which prompted my questions to begin with.....Origin India should be ashamed of themselves for serving this garbage and having the nerve to say this food was prepared by anyone claiming themselves to be a "Chef".  AND the prices are outlandish! It's close to the strip and seems to be a tourist trap. I would not risk my health eating here. And that's no laughing matter.
