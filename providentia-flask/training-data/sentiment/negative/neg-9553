I wish i could give this place 0.5 starts or less.  To start the girl at the counter has no idea what she is doing. Second the food was not good. The falafel were way over cooked and the fries were undercooked. My husband's shawarma was not filled up like Courtney park does. We haven't gone to this location since this incident and I don't think we ever will.
