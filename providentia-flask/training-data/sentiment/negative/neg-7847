Terrible.  Very disappointing. We went for ramen and it was very plain and tasteless.  Hard boiled egg instead of pickled.  Dry pork instead of pork belly. Asked if they could make just a plate of noodles for our 3 year old and she said no.  We don't have noodles.  Well what is in your ramen?  Services was just plain rude.
