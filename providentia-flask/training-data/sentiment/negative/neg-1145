Horrible customer service. I was told that I could not use a Groupon because there was not a manager on duty to approve it. A few weeks later Groupon emailed me a letter saying that I was refunded my money due to issues with Pita Pit. The food was also awful. I don't even know how this place is still in business. Stay away!!
