Cheap but very bland-tasting burgers..

The woman at the cash looked really miserable today. 

Service was quick, food is prepared quickly.

The bun is huuuge compared to the patty. When I bit into the burger I found it pretty tasteless.

Should've just had Harvey's next door.

Not coming back here.. Next!!
