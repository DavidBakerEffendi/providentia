So disappointed in my experience today. I've been to Romados several times before when the food was decent with generous portions but today was not their day. First off, if you've bought a Groupon, they don't tell you to first head to the cash to validate it. So we waited in line to order food only to then be told to go line up at the cash before coming back to order our food. Then we go back to the guy prepping the food with our validated Groupon who's fulfilling our order and he hands us a bag of fries. We're hungry, we've been waiting for a while so we start eating them until he says "no, you don't get fries, only poutine" and takes it back only to throw the rest in with the large batch of fries for other customers. How DISGUSTING and unhygienic. Finally (to put the cherry on top), we decided at the last minute to take a small bottle of coke instead of the 1.5L water bottle included in our order. The old woman behind the cash literally opens the door and is ready to chase us down the street, which almost gets me run over at this point, and rudely tells me to return the coke that I stole. I explain that I took the coke instead of the water but at this point, the experience had deteriorated to a point of no return. She grabbed the coke, returns it to the fridge, and doesn't even bring me my water. When I ask her for it, she tells me to go get it myself and won't even look at me. Congratulations, you really stopped someone from stealing(!) I will make sure to try every single one of their competitors instead and never return. Word of mouth is a powerful tool and you've just lost a loyal customer.
