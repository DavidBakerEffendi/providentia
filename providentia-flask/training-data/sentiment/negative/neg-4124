Place sucks and is no way fast food. Went inside because I had a coupon and waited 15 minutes to get my order! Nothing better than waiting inside and watching six drive-thru orders get filled before yours. Also love how they charge85 for extra condiments! Young lady that took my order was really nice and best thing about this visit. Will drive extra distance to another location and try them out.
