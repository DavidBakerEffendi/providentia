Just opened today and we where so ready!!we have driven to the two other locations and they where not in the best areas but by far our favorite pizza. We got the 1/2 sheet and large fries and it was more then plenty for our family of 5.

I was the first review and we where so excited but the service is bad and a few times the pizza has not been done and the last time the fries where not done. I wrote a PM on yelp to tell them i didn't wanna re review with no reply.
