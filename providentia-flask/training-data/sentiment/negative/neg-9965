This used to be a really great place to eat and bring your family however recently it has become a frat party. Every time I walk in there it has crazy lights and loud music and a bunch of frat looking guys doing shots and screaming. I thought this was a Japanese restaurant? Also my friend got yelled at by the manager for asking to sit in a quieter area?! There are other Hibachi restaurants that are more authentic and no meat heads.
