1 - I can guarantee you that a price was not quoted to my fianc√© at the time of order. 
2 - I looked for your menu online and was unable to find it. I did find a Stavros but was for a different location. I did note that their prices were much more reasonable. Mind posting your menu here?
3 - I never demanded that the driver pick up the pizza for a refund. I called to check on the prices after being astonished at the high price for the small amount delivered. I had one foot out the door to bring them back to you myself as you are literally a 2 minute walk from my home. Unfortunately my moving help was extremely hungry and convinced me that waiting for another delivery would take too long.
4- I have had your pizza and I have had 2 of the others I listed. I have also had pizza from dozens of places in town not to mention some of the best from other cities around North America. Yours is good but don't kid yourself, for the price point it is not the top of the heap.
5- your employee took down my name and number and said she would have a manager call me. That was never done. You seem more concerned to troll the internet and spin your public image than to deal with the customer issue at hand. This seems rather evident in that you edited your response 5 times after your initial writing and yet have not bothered to even call me. 
6- when a customer contacts you with a complaint they are giving you the opportunity to make it right. Your complete disregard has just lost you a customer for life and all of the negative lip service I can muster.
