The place is mainly a small bar with bar seating and small tables. It has a small Korean snack menu and full bar.

We were seated for beers but then forced to move to sit at the bar when we didn't order food. Funny enough, ppl were eating at the bar. Not a service oriented gesture.

Based on the poor service and small selection of menu options, I won't return or recommend.
