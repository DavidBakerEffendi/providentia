I've been to this location several times since I get my car serviced right next door.  It's been a while.  I remember it being just your typical local bar restaurant with tables/booths.

They have since changed so you walk into what looks more like pure bare with a few tables but big open space, dart boards, pool table and the very first thing with only 3 people in the place was smoke hitting you full force. 

I dropped my car off at lunch and figured I would grab a bite, relax and just wait.  The food situation is weird.  The kitchen is one company but everything else is another... or I think that's how it worked.  Two different servers.  Two different tabs.  Food was decent pub food and pizza.

Kitchen service was prompt.  Bar service could have been better.  I know when it's slow and you are working and have a friend to chat with it might be hard to remember to check with your 3 customers and see if they need anything but a glance over the shoulder every minute or two isn't terribly hard.

Overall, it was pretty disappointing.  Lack of adequate ventilation and surprisingly high level of smoke for so few people meant sinus problems for me for days.  (Usually I'm OK with casinos and other smoking areas even though I'm a non-smoker...so it really was pretty bad.)
