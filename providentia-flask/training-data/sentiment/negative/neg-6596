Worst cupcakes. I've tried the salted Caramel and the marshmallow cupcakes. The cream on both was very dense but bland. The salted caramel cupcake just tasted like chocolate cake aside from a tiny dollop of caramel in the middle. Disappointing. The marshmallow was just strange. I can't even place what it tasted like but it wasn't marshmallow. The white cake base also had a funny aftertaste. Overall I would not get these cupcakes. Even grocery store cupcakes are better.
