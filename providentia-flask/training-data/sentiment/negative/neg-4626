I ordered, picked up my order, came home and all I had was French fries. I ordered the egg and chorizo plate with a taco. I ordered a side of fries. This place is about a 10 minutes drive from my house. Not far but far enough. I should have checked the order when I picked it up but I suppose I didn't expect people to be so incompetent that they couldn't put things into a bag. It's not that hard. I know I sound like a jerk but I'm writing this literally right after I had a conversation with an employee named Pablo there who really irked me. 

I told him I was unhappy and that I wanted a refund. He immediately said no refunds. He also tried to accuse me of having the order by saying they don't have any left over food. Then I asked to speak to a manager who could do something. He a said the manager went to lunch. It is 7:00 pm. After continuing the conversation and explaining to this person that they cannot keep my money for a product I never received and no longer want, I asked when the manager would be back. He said he doesn't know and they will probably be back "like on Monday or something". I then questioned him about his statement earlier saying the manager is on lunch. He said the manager went out to eat. Then I asked him if they are on lunch until Monday. He said that it was obvious I should know this since they're about to close and that's their store hours. I replied to him that I don't work there so it isn't obvious to me that they would be there on Monday. I have to say that this person came off as a condescending, uneducated, liar. He is not the type is person a proprietor would want answering their phones or being the vocal representation of their company. 

Considering there are over 100 Mexican restaurants within 10 miles of this place, you would think they weren't such inflexible jerks. I went to PHX Burrito House instead where I get great food and great service. I will never order from this place again. So much for wanting to try something new.
