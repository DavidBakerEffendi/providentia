It was a terrible experience.  I ordered a seafood noodle.  The look  of the soup was ok and full with ingredients.  But the taste was extremely bad.  The fish ball and crabmeat taste like plastic.  The shrimp cracker texture is like bread more than cracker.  Too much MSG.  I don't mind pay more for better quality food.  I don't understand why this pho restaurant for a much higher rating with bad quality food
