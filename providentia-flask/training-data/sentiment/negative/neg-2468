Why did I give this place one star...

a. I ordered a medium rare cause I'm low on iron (yay pregnancy) it came out medium..barely any pink. The man ordered medium and it was medium well so it wasn't a mistake. 
b. chili was so dry and lackluster
c. $30 bucks for to subpar burgers, fries and a shake

You should try
the bacon milkshake, which does taste like apple jacks
the spicy pickles from the pickle bar.
