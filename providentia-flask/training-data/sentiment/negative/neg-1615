The clientele did not make me feel safe, and not even 5 minutes in a drunk man falls from his chair and hits his head on one of the seats very hard. Nobody cared to help and the recommendation was to have him drink som more. Honestly he should have been cut off. Nobody took our order after we asked for service and we bounced after 15 minutes. I'd rather go to Applebee's than come here again.
