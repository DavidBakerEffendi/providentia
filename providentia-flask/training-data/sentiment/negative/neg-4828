New place  first visit  walked out  bad service waited too long to be greeted, eight  employees standing around  manager more interested in flirting with staff  ice tea was terrible, stale no lemon or sugared offered ,menu  after I asked for it  was ok but I was so put off by the staff I did not think I would give them 12 dollars for a Big Mac   I was hoping for a new hangout in the area  this is not it  wished them good luck ( sarcasm) on my way out they said thanks for coming in a grunt and did not notice nor care I was in and out in fifteen minutes
