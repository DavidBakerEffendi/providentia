Nice place with decent food but horrible customer service. Had a night out for bowling and dinner planned on a random weekday night. We checked the website and social media before to make sure the social house has open. We showed up to find that PSA was completely reserved by several random companies. This place decided to rent out all of their facilities to several companies and didn't bother putting this info on any social media or their website. The only post on social media was a post advertising their heated patio and even that was booked!
