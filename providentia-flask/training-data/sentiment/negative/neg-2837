Pretty disappointed.... $50 per person for a Vegas Buffet... Seafood none the less and NO LOBSTER... really????
The taste and quality of the other seafood/fish was below average as well. My boyfriend, who likes everything and eats everything, didn't even like the food.... his stomach got upset in the middle of dinner so that was it for him.

Best thing I ate was the Elvis Presley Gelato-- banana with PB and J! Not the seafood.  

I should have asked for my money back
