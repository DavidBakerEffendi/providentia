Wish I could have reviewed the food but last Thursday we stood at the hostess table around 5:45pm and nobody was around. We stood there for at least 5 minutes and even saw what appeared to be the manager and someone else who works there at a large table nearby just talking.
The place was empty as well, there's no excuse for poor service let alone "no" service. So we walked out and went to stone and vine.  Wow!
