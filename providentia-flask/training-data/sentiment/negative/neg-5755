Worst burger ever!  Worst Margarita ever.  I went in with groupon and the whole right side of the menu says NO GROUPONS for this side of menu.  Whats the difference?  Money paid, is money paid.  I would of spent way more beyond my groupon, but NOOOOO, So we had the Cheese steak...pressed meat...canned sauce taste.  My burger was horrible, like meat was left in fridge for days., they brought me a second one, first bite, I ended up spitting it out.  We ended up spending $30 bucks, and I left with out dinner.  Drinks suck, burgers suck, groupon UNFRIENDLY.  I use groupon to try out new places.  I have asked for a refund for this one.
