I should have read the prior reviews and headed the warnings.  Alas, I did not.

While everyone involved in my take-out order was friendly, the horrible quality of the dry, cold, wings was absolutely pitiful. While there was plenty of sauce, it looked like they just dumped a bucket of sauce over the old decrepit bird parts.

For what it's worth, I used to go to another location of BWW in Pittsburgh all the time, and the food quality was much better.

There's simply something wrong with this location? Kitchen staff?

Avoid. Yuck.

Of course the main problem here is that one bad location gives the whole chain a bad reputation.  BWW Corporate should investigate this location.
