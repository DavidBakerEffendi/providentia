This place has absolutely no soul. It's that sterile museum-like type of place where you feel like you can't touch anything. Not the kind of environment for a coffee house in what used to be a pillar to the Phoenix Art and Music Scene. I don't care how dingy and mismanaged the former Willow House became. When it came down to it, it was still one of the best things Phoenix had to offer it's counter-cultural artsy citizens. The former Willow House may not have been as spruced up as a place Hob Nobs is today, but the food was better, the service was more genuine, and the events there were fantastic. Poets had their own night, Musicians had their own open mic that drew in some of the best local talent Phoenix has today, and so on...Now...it's all just a fading memory. 

Simply put, Hob Nobs has inferior baristas, the art is disgustingly main-stream/mass-market looking, and the live music they have there is so bad, Starbucks wouldn't even play it. Their prices are too high for mediocre food, and don't even get me started on their baked goods. To the people who think the art is gorgeous... have you never walked into ANY of the dozens of REAL art galleries in Phoenix? Also, I'm no interior designer, but leather seats and high wooden pub tables in one room and chrome and glass w/ a flat-screen TV in another doesn't seem like the place I'd like to be in. One star for the bathroom upgrade, but I guess it doesn't matter since they shit all over the place anyway.

PS. I'm not just saying all of this as a blind Willow House loyalist-- if you look through my reviews, I frequent most of the coffee shops all around town and this one is just a huge rip-off.

OH, and they have permission to sell beer now...which is probably because their coffee sucks so bad, no reasonable sober person could possibly want any.
