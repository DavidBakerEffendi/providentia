I don't know how there are 4/5 stars here! I tried two dishes (Pad Thai and the Fresh Spring Rolls) and my family members tried two additional items (Panang and fried rolls), and we all agreed this was some of the worst Asian food we've had. Bland sauces, mushy chicken, overly sauced Pad Thai (even though I ordered it with the sauce on the side!). And did I mention the chicken bone, and what I can only explain as grains of sand, in my Fresh Roll?! Just... yucky :(
