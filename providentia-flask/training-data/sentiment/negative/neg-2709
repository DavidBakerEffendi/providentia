Worst experience I had in a restaurant. First, the burger came little burnt. Secondly, the waiter was very rude, in the beginning he was rushing us while taking orders, and when we paid he was very unprofessional in his behaviour, and disrespectful, because our tips were low, he even asked about our backgrounds, and made sarcastic comments about it.
