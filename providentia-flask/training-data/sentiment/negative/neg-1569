My party of four was actually so offended that after ordering our drinks we decided that we couldn't stay for food and ended up across the street at Mezzetta (which is super awesome by the way).

Our server was almost immediately annoyed with us. Was it because I attempted to order a wine (from their wine list)  that was apparently "horrible and not a good wine and even if it was in stock he would not have allowed me to have it" or was it because I asked for a description of the 2 alternate wines he suggested because I had never heard of them (no description was offered even after asking) OR (and this really seemed to upset our server) was it because my friend asked for water? It seemed a huge inconvenience to him that he had to bring us water. At which point it was time to take our food order. And this is what put him over the edge...
I asked to have no cheese on my  pizza (all the pizza have cheese). I'm mildly lactose intolerant and some days I just can not handle a lot of cheese. This was not allowed. (and not because the restaurant was busy. There was only one other table with people) I said I needed more time to make a choice. He never returned and refused to even look in the direction of our table after this. 

*FYI - I've been to Italy and you most certainly can have both pizzas and pastas that are not loaded with cheese. I get that they want to uphold the integrity of their dishes but a lot of authentic Italian dishes do not have cheese.

Another server came and offered to take our food order but we just paid the bill for our drinks and left. I will never return.
