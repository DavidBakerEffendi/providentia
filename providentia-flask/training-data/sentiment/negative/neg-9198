Resentful, unwelcoming service staff (with the sole exception of the marvelous gentleman at the desserts area). Horrible coffee, mediocre grocery-store quality sushi, and cold breakfast eggs and hash browns with sickly-sweet chicken apple sausages.  At lunchtime. Need I say more?  Stay here but eat elsewhere.
