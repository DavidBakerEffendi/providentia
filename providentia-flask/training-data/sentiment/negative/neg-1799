We used to be regulars until this morning. We get to this tiny place and all the booths are taken, one of the main servers ( woman with shoulder length hair) was setting up outdoor patio tables, we asked if we could sit there? We were told I'm not ready? Instead of saying sure, I'll grab you a coffee and keep setting up and I'll take your order from you shortly once I'm done. We were a tad freaked that she would say this to regulars who tip this person very well, we left and went to what is now our favourite new breakfast spot. In this day and age, this kind of incompetent service will close the doors. The food was always served tasty but luke warm. Ok,ok, good-bye, good-bye.
