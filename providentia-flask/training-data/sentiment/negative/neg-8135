Deserves 1 star ! Came in with my 3 yr old. I'm dieting so I didnt buy any but my daughter filled up her cup. When I was ready to Check out they charged me regular price instead of happy hour half off bc I guess we only bought one cup (I think she thought it was all for me) The cashier kept arguing  with me about the happy hour deal they have from 2-5 daily for kids 12 and under. She said something about the cup being to full!!?? Sooo?? My daughter could be eating it all !! So rude !!! Never going back here again
