If you go to eat at the store you might want to actually ask somebody where you're supposed to be standing if you want to place an order as many times I've gone to Capriotti's throughout Las Vegas and Henderson you always order at the counter  and then usually pay for it after you order it. Not so much at the store if you standby the counter you will surely be ignored and they will help the people that are standing by the register so advice to anybody who plans on eating here ask where you're supposed to order from because it's not stated where.
