This location deserves a 0 stars!  Awful just awful!  Cannot fathom that they can't put together a 6pc nugget happy meal and forget the damn nuggets!  Seriously?  The employees are always fighting with each other or on their phones and could give 2 sh$ts!  Management needs fired because it never gets better!  Drive thru order last week, 3 items should've been in the bag and they forgot the double hamburger.  Awful just awful!
