Everything about this place was a lie. When I got there I was told there would be a 25 minute wait. Then I was told there would be a 45 minute wait. I ended up waiting for an hour and a half. They then said the fries and wings where made in house. They tasted awful and they where so clearly bought frozen that anyone could taste it. Don't go here.
