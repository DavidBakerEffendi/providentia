Every time I come here, its almost a full star worse than the last. Too bad, because I used to live very close. 

My first experience was great because I'm a Happy Hour Junkie and they had my FIX!

Half price apps and good beers WERE the norm back then.

Not anymore. Apparently my spending $50-$90 during happy hour on reduced price items here was too much for them so they changed the HH menu to a few select items, and now, not so great prices. GRRRR!

If you're looking for a place that is trying to be more of a Breast-rant, then go here. Otherwise, Its just overpriced bar food with a few signature items and lacking service that can be had pretty much anywhere else.
