Poor service. One waiter for a group of 15!!! Ordered dinner 45 prior to getting everyone else order and I still didn't get my food. The server also got the checks mixed up. Charges that were not mine were on my check. He shouldn't have waited on our table without help. Food got cold before I got my ketchup for my fries, so I ended eating them before they got cold. Reservation was at 6, we didn't get our food until 8. We didn't get out of the restaurant until 1030. What a mess of a biethday celebration it was. We made reservations and the service was still poor. Done!
