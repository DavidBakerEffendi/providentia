Went to this location today.  was asked if my dog was a service animal.  I said yes and was asked to provide documentation.

 The manager then yelled from the back that my friend and I had to leave because of our dogs.  Had I been given a chance to explain to the manager that they were service dogs, I wouldn't have written this review.  But I wasnt asked by the manager.  I was just told to leave.
