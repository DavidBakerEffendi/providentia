Terrible service. Took waitress forever to take our order. Then while taking our order walks to another customer because something was wrong with his order.  Then walks to bar and gives customers who just sat menus. Then spends time  at the register. Finally comes back to our table and told her she was rude for not excusing herself.  After taking our order she asks if we wanted another waiter and I told her NO as she has taken our orders already. 

Food finally arrives. My Mary Jane sandwich was alright but the hash browns had a taste that I could describe as soapy. Maybe they were frozen. 

The gravy was very salty. The servings were massive but will not compensate for mediocre flavor.  Coupled with bad service - Not coming back. Disappointed.
