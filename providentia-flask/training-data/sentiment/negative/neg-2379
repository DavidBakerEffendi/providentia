HORRIBLE BARTENDER. We will not be back.  We stopped in on Tuesday, March 14 about 7pm. The young, thin bartender said hello. We sat at the far end of bar, then he proceeded to ignore us for the next ten minutes because he was sitting on the beer cooler, talking to 4 friends. I leaned over a couple times to see if I could catch his attention. Nope. So I walked down to where his friends were sitting and stood there (not in an a-hole way...just in a hey there, I'm here way)  He continued to talk to his friends. I finally turned to walk away and I heard him say oh I'll be right there. Another few minutes passed and still he's chatting up his buddies. We left and spent our money (and a lot of it) at another bar. We are not a-holes...we've both worked in the service industry, so we "get" when you are busy. This guy was not.
