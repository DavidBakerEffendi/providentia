So they got my order wrong. Took it to address I lived at 3 years ago. I used to order from them for over 4 years. They said it was thr trainees fault and i should of confirmed my address. Need I mind you I ordered from them for 4 years. The owner Bill was condescending and rude. They offered me a credit and I wanted to use it then. Also my wife is pregnant so this situation is sensitive. Instead I was dismissed and was insulted.  Never again will I order from them.
No customer service. The customer is ALWAYS right.
