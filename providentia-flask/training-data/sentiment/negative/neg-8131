We go to Einstein's often but this one had terrible service. We walk in and no one greeted us. Ok. We waited a while for someone to finally help us and when they did, they were very rude. I have been in the customer service industry for a while so I know bad days happen but the whole staff was unfriendly. Wouldn't recommend.
