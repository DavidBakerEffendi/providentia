Post Zoe's Kitchen Trauma- goes like this.

We went to Zoë's normally we have a good experience with occasional dirty dishes and silverware.

However, today we would have to rate them -stars except that Yelp insist you give at least one. 

I order a cup of soup and my husband beef kabobs. Over 45 minutes later no food. Everyone was very upset as their food was taking forever too.  I had asked the girl if I could at least get my cup of  soup apparently, standing behind the counter waiting for customers is all she could handle. I persisted and said, it is just a cup of soup, she replied, we are busy your order should be up soon. Now, I have seen this place busy for lunches and we were no where close to that. This place was not packed really about 7 people total but when I discovered they were ALL waiting for food I decided it was time to go we asked for our money back and left. 

It will be a long... long time before we ever return to this Zoë's Kitchen. But please don't allow me to influence you,  if you have nothing to do ALL DAY LONG this could be your favorite restaurant.
