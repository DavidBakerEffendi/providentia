If you and your friends are looking for some decent food and live entertainment hit up your boys at Joe's. If we had left with food and an apology, this review would have never happened. The worst part of our experience was the manager and how he chose to "handle" the situation. We sat in a freezing booth, waited 15 mins to order an app through a different server, then about 20 later they arrived. Our server was confused and awkward the whole time. Also only saw him a couple times until we were handed off to a different server. She was the most professional out of all of the staff we interacted with. When my friends chicken came out undercooked, she took it back and the manager made brief contact about it being out soon. 20 minutes later, my friend asked for it to go from the manager directly and he somehow still couldn't get it done. We were there under 2 hours, had some Coca Cola and iced tea, ate some underwhelming appetizers, and still didn't leave with a to go salad for my girl. The manager refused to come by the table, was very aware of the current situation, and did nothing but cowardly stand on expo talking with his boys. I am appalled and have never seen a manager act like that when their guests are inconvenienced by the restaurants mistake. You lost me, Joe.
