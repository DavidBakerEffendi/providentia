yes its nice to have a restaurant that's not a part of a chain but the price should not be the same in the strip. this is rediculous place. the price of the food is like a tourist price. their waffle is $5.75 thats only a simple waffle. if you go to denny's you can have a complete breakfast  for that price. this is a no no no place to go. i will not recommend this place to anybody.
