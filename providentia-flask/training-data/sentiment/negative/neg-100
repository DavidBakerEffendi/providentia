This place, at one time, with the palate of a typical college bro, might've been good. I don't really know how they are still in business, other than the fact that they charge $1,000 for every item on the menu. The hot sandwiches seem undercooked and uninspired. The cold sandwiches taste like pre-made subs you'd get at the end of the day from your local grocery store. I get the feeling that they've lost biz from local bizzes movin' in, so it might have resulted in raised prices and not as fresh of food. 

I do remember them having a pretty tasty, spicy pulled pork special. Also, their soups are pretty decent. I like that they have a daily special and soups of the day. 

Overall, kinda hope this place just goes away.
