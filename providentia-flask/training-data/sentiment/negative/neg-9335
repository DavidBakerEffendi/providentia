I'm giving this place a 1 star for the moment. I read the reviews and was so excited to try it this morning for some breakfast. The hours on yelp said open at 9am. Sign on the door says open at 9am. We were there at 9:30am and doors were locked and no one was inside. I called the number and no answer. I was really looking forward to dinning here and even made the drive to. I'll be back to actually try the food and hopefully it helps me change the stars.
