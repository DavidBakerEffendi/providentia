If i could give you zero stars i would... This place is dirty.  No one greets you.  Stood for almost 10 mins to place my order and nothing.  It was more important for the bimbo behind the counter to flirt with the guy instead of doing her job.  I dont see how you can stay in biz in a downtown area with people employed like this.  Believe this or not.  Im not a hard guy to please.  Fuel sucks!!!
