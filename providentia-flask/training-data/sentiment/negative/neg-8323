None of us could even finish our desserts, they were so awful. Maybe we should have gotten the mango pomelo tapioca seeing the other reviews...but I'm never going back. I was hesitant at first because I am not a fan of the 許留山 in NYC. But since the menu was different, I thought I could give it a try. Ugh much regret

If you do come here, don't get the black sesame or walnut dessert soups. They tasted so sweet and artificial I actually spit out my first spoonful. 

I guess I'll rate it more of a 1.5 because my sister really liked #59, even though I thought the tofu tasted off. 

Cash only!
