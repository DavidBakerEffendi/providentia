We work for one of the major hotels on the strip.  We work the grave shift and since this place stayed open late, we decided to order from them.  
The chicken fingers looked overcooked and it was stale as were my fries.
We ordered a full bucket of chickn wings-MILD (32 pieces) and only got 1/2 bucket (16 pieces) and they were HOT.
When we called, the owner was extremely rude and made us feel like we were lying.  He asked us if we ate the wings and that he wanted them back.  He never apologized or offered any compensation.
Our order came out to $52...you would think we would get a little bit of customer service.  When we asked how long the driver would be, he said "he'll be there when he gets there"!!  Yes!  And this was the OWNER!
When the driver returned, we told him we knew it wasn't his fault but we were very disappointed.  In fact he was the only good thing about this place.  
And guess what?  When we got the wings, the box was melted and the sauce was put on the side in containers and the covers weren't even on.  So all the sauce leaked everywhere.
Wish I could post pictures so you could see how horrible this place is.  DON'T ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!
