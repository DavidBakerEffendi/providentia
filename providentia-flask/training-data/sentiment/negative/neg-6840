30 min. in the drive thru. Then they tried to charge me $18 for a two piece meal that was $7.49. Then they lost my order and I had to reorder. So THAT girl disappeared and another one took over, and again tried to charge me $16!  I ordered a THIRD time.  Fortunately they have me a second drink, because they didn't know the first girl already gave me one, and I got a free piece of pie, because I was livid!  Check your orders people!!  She said everyone was new, but apparently no one got any training yet.
