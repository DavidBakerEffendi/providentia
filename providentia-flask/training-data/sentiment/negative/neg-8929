Oh, how the mighty have fallen, unfortunately.

I use to go to Pint Central a lot....  multiple times a week - sometimes for lunch (by myself or with a friend) and for dinner with my wife.  The service used to be excellent, as was the food - both the sammichs and the small plates.

A year or more ago the food was fantastic - all of it, and the service was friendly.  I can remember ordering a caesar at lunch and adding shrimp - the bartender would ask if I wanted the shrimp blackened or not....  when the salad came out, it was once of the best caesars I've ever had - with six big, beautiful shrimp on top.

When I was there a month ago, that same caesar came out and it was a different story - it wasn't fresh, the shrimp were TINY, and to be honest, I've had better salads at Hooters....   and Hooters is not exactly known for their salads.  :)

I don't know what happened....  but this place went from being awesome to basically sucking.  I hope they figure it out and can return it to its former glory.
