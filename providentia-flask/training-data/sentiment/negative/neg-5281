Let me start my review off by saying that my husband and I really enjoy the food here, and have been coming since they first opened.  But the service is just beyond terrible, literally getting worse each time we come.  Last time I went the guy making my salad knocked over the salad container and attempted to picked it all up, even stuff that fell on the floor until I called him out on it. I was baffled.  My husband has a shellfish allergy, and they do have shrimp on the toppings bar, so we notified them immediately.  Yet the cashier in no way notifies the person making the salad, so saying something is worthless   Not to mention dirty tables and trash everywhere.  They're obviously too busy for the unexperienced, young workers to handle   They really need to step it up. We should really stop going, but the salads are so good!
