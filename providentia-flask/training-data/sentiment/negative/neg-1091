I would love to come here with my kids but it's dangerous specifically after school. I do admit they are trying to keep the rowdy kids out but they are not the police and can hardly keep things safe. I'm sitting here and personally am observing tweakers and kids who come in grab a drink from the drink machine without paying. Sad and it ticks me off
