Sorry but this is the last straw.... I ordered three double-doubles and two animal style fries and was told there would be a wait for the fries after waiting in line for nearly 20 mins. After I got home to my surprise.. NO burgers in my bag.. AFTER PAYING AND WAITING FOR THEM... completely unprofessional, rip-off, robbery. Never visiting this pathetic location again, no in fact, I will never be dining at an in-n-out again that is a promise. What type of franchise would do that to loyal customers? Disgusting. Despicable. Disgraceful. Thanks for ruining my entire evening.
