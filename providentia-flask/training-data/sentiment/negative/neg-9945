the worst restaurant in Las Vegas. how does this place stay open?  upon walking in.. there were only two tables that had people sitting there.  both tables were not Chinese people.. they were Mexican.. which tells you this place is not authentic. then.. you sit down at a table.. which are like made out of cardboard by the way. the waiter is unkind and only said the word "ok" to us after we ordered. he didn't say hello or anything. the tea we got was room temperature and watered down. the food is flavorless. I've never had to put so much salt in my food before as I did tonight. we ordered yunnan rice noodle soup$7.99 and beef noodles$8.99. totally unauthentic. the portions are not small.. they're down right STINGY. a lot of water and a little bit of flavor. all the pieces of chicken I received was only bone. the ham tastes as if it has been sitting in the freezer for ever. don't think that putting chili oil in your food will make it taste better, because their chili oil sucks too. is this place really named "spicy city"? also finally.. even though there were only three tables that were occupied now at this point, the waiter didn't bother checking up on us or even giving us the check. service sucks but i would have been okay with that if the food didn't suck. but it did. EVERYTHING SUCKS.
