Decided to give this local spot a chance. Nice and clean bar/restaurant, look over the menu and notice regular bar food. Wings, burgers, sandwiches. Was pleasantly surprised to see a chili burger was on the menu. Bartender was very pleasant and welcoming. About 15 mins have passed and the bartender reassured me the burger would be out soon. About 20 mins for a burger I think took too long. Was hungry and excited to dog in. First impression, square plate like a upscale dinning restaurant but who cares hopefully the chili burger will taste as good as the plate looks. Onto the food, there was no bun, it look like wheat toast. No onion as I requested so that good. First bite and no flavor, beans tasted like they were out of a can. Fry's were over salted. I was so hungry, I just ate the burger because I had to go to work. I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for another burger.
