One word to describe Bottiliglia, disaster.

To start off the disastrous experience, we called and made a reservation. When we arrived, the three hostesses could not find our reservation. However, they were still able to seat us. After we were seated it took a while for our waitress to bring our menus, it took longer for our waters to be delivered, it took even longer for our orders to be taken, and it took an eternity for our food to be delivered. Also, I tried to use the Yelp check in offer for a free glass of wine but my waitress did not honor it. Conveniently some tables that were seated after us received their food before us. One table also finished their meal before we received our food. After our food was delivered, precisely 65 minutes after first sitting down, we asked for our check. Of course to cap off a bad experience we are brought another table's check. After we got the right check, it was the check used to charge hotel guests who charge to their rooms so again we had to request another check. Horrible multi flawed dinner.

My party had the spinach lasagna, the pappardelle bolognese, and the clam linguini. The food itself is decent. Nothing special nor worth writing home about. 

I will not be returning and cannot recommend dining here. If you do dine I suggest giving them several weeks to try working some of the many kinks out. 

The restaurant itself is nicely renovated.
The service is very flawed and needs major overhaul. We did dine on Friday the 13 so that may have been our downfall.
