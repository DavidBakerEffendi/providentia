I had been eaten here for over 2 years.their price is a mountain up from $24.99 to $32.99, I'm not cheap but $100 for all you can eat for two people is too much,i rather pay $10 more for Bacchanal buffet at caesar hotel. 
The service is ok,sometimes horrible. There is one lady always stop me when i order more than 2 items, i was like : "this is all you can eat,i want to order whatever i like" and she will give you a WTF looks, yeah like WTF  ?!!
EVERYONE PLEASE SEARCH "HWARO" that the new Korean BBQ just open and their services and price are very good. Only $20 AYCE korean BBQ and so much better than Woonam Jung
