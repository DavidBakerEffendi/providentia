How is this rated so high?!?!?

I phoned in an order for the orange chicken, extra spicy and the tofu curry, unfried.

The guy on the phone said their tofu is only fried.  OK, so this pretty much means they buy the tofu already fried and don't cut it up and fry it themselves... 

When I got home (3 miles away) the food was luke-warm.  The orange chicken appeared to have been prepared by dumping 1/4 cup of red pepper flakes into the sauce.  There's no veggies with the orange chicken, and it didn't taste any better than any other random Chinese place.  The steamed rice was dry and slightly hardened, another disappointment.  

My girlfriend had the tofu curry which was ok she said, nothing special.  

Inside the store it was all young people who seemed polite.  

Really, it was nothing to warrant even 2 stars in my opinion.  

Even the fortune cookie we received had broken English:

"Like the river flow into the sea.  Something are meant to be."
