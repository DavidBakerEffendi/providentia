I am a fan of Milestones but at this location I met the DUMBEST and RUDEST WAITRESS.

I went here for brunch with a friend and had a feeling service would be bad from the beginning, when we didn't see our waitress for at least 15 minutes after we received our waters.

When we told her our food orders, before the waitress walked away, I asked my friend if she wanted a tea or coffee to go with her breakfast.....(why am I thinking of this?)

I would have ordered a tea, but the waitress left as if our table was on fire!

My friend and I asked for separate checks, and the dummy switched our two totals around, which my friend innocently paid for MY receipt.

When it came time for me to pay, I pointed out the error to the waitress, who just stood there with a blank look on her face.

I asked if its possible to reverse it.

Well that question must have offended her greatly, because she GRABBED THE TRANSACTION MACHINE ABRUPTLY FROM MY HAND,  mumbled something out of her breath and STOMPED AWAY, SHAKING HER HEAD.

Shortly after a heavy set gentleman (I assume the manager), told us the complications of reversing it, but we told him to void it anyways.

I told the man OUR WAITRESS WAS CLEARLY IRRITATED (although it was HER mistake...).

He was very polite, and it worked out in my favour because I LEFT HER ZERO TIP (I promise you, I HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE).

I'm out of town, but if in an unlikely situation I ate there again I MEMORIZED HER NAME and would REQUEST NOT TO BE PUT IN HER SECTION.

I would imagine someone her age (I'm guessing late 50s) would know by now in life, at your job, especially the service industry, YOU NEED TO FIND A SPECIAL PLACE TO VENT YOUR EMOTIONS (like the kitchen maybe??) 

BUT NOT IN FRONT OF YOUR CUSTOMERS.
