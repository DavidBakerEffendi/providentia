I got a coupon In  The mail saying they were open, drove one hour to get here. They weren't open and they could have cared less about false advertisement

They don't even state their hours on their website and they close 9 pm on Sunday? Ridiculous. I complained and they said they were fixing that problem

I came back and here's my report

The margaritas are fake tasting but for a Pittsburgh palate this may suffice. Chips need salt and salsa needs some heat to it. It tastes like canned tomato sauce 

The food wasn't flavored or seasoned well, but this region may like bland , tasteless food 

I want a real margarita made with limes, cut fresh, tequila and orange liquor, but this place won't change, they are making a go of it with cheap, substandard ingredients

The so called manager was just a guy at the hostess stand. He was useless. Poor management!

They don't use the correct poblano pepper in chili rellenos, they cut corners
