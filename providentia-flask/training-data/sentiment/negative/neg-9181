The food was okay, not the best I've had & not the worst. I won't be coming here again tho I don't like that they charge a gratuity on to the bill and a $6 one at that. When I leave a tip & I always do it depends on how you serve & so on. Tips are not mandatory you get paid to serve & if you go above & beyond it's the customers choice to tip you.
