I loved the location in Minnesota, but this one not only had fewer topping choices and were stingy with the ones they offered, but the toppings had at least 2 pebble like things in the garlic or the olives. I thought the first one was a fluke, but the second one I BROKE my tooth on! It fractured bad enough the dentist tells me I will have 3 grand in repair bills when the implant is done, so definitely the most expensive meal I've eaten.
