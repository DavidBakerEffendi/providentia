This place used to be really good. I would go there once a month or so. Hadn't been there in a couple years and decided to stop in...

They had no iced tea, very weird for a restaurant. They brought my water out in a cup that stank like mildew or something and had some sort of white residue caked up on the insides of the cup.

I wasn't too hungry, the person I was with came to eat, I was just sort of tagging along, so I ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings. The person I was with got their food and ate more than half of it before my wings showed up. When they did show up you could taste the filthy oil. I'm guessing they haven't changed their fryer oil in quite some time. 

On top of all of this, the servers lean against a wall in the dining area and stare at the customers without ever addressing them. After you get your food and drink, if you want something else, you have to get their attention and call them over.

All in all, this place is pretty terrible. Do yourself a favor and stay away
