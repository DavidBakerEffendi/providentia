I cannot tell you how unbelievable Sad it makes me to only give this bakery one star. I have been a customer of this business for over 17 years and they have done every birthday cake I've ordered during that time. Unfortunately, the service was so bad when I ordered my son's first birthday cake on July 1 I can no longer patronize Baker Wee. 

I was completely stunned by this.  I asked a friend of mine who was also a customer is she had had any issues and she told me the business Had recently been sold to a new owner and the new owner let go of all the existing staff. Guess that explains why the service was so bad and the quality was not as good. I spoke with someone three times over the phone and even came into the store to discuss the design etc. The final cake was nowhere near what I asked for. We had to wait an additional hour for them to fix the design and it still wasn't right. Made our whole party late. Then they didn't even give us the smash cake which just ruined the whole first birthday experience. 

Then to add insult to injury they charged me $15 more for the cake than I usually pay AND I had to buy the deco pack.  So disappointed.  Now I'm in the lurch trying to find a new bakery for my son and daughter's party.
