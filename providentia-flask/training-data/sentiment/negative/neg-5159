This place is horrible. The people are so rude. We placed an order online and didn't get any sort or receipt. After calling they were short with us saying "yea we have it you'll get it." After waiting almost an hour we called back to try an get a time reference. The person on the other end was short an said they were leaving in a few minutes. 20 minutes later we had the delivery and the person at the door yelled about how she had to wonder around to try and find the building and next time to put the information in better. We opened the box and not only was the pizza wrong it was cold. We won't be ordering from them again.
