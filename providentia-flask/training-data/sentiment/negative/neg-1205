Yelp actually removed my previous review of this place. The reason for it was that they felt it was not indicative of actually having visited the place. Well let me rewrite this so its clear that yes I have eaten here and yes the review is legit. First off how someone can give this place more than one star is beyond me. Let me explain. I have been going here for years. I grew up in the area. The place started as Village square pizza. When I was a kid I remember walking in and the place was set up like an old school Italian place. Red and white squares all over the place. Old wood. This place has not changed at all since. This place sounds nice but its not. In my most recent visit they did away with the white and red table clothes but the its still the same tables, probably the same carpet. They just replaced the old tube tv with a flatscreen the last time I was in there. The food the last time I was in there was greasy. It was most surely not fresh. Just full of grease. Full of grease. Now I have  not been here in a while. One, cause I no longer live there. Two, because it was not good at all. I would only go there to show someone who had not seen the area a local staple. It does not mean the local staple is good. The place never had the best service. In fact the service was long and slow. I barely remember the service because it was something  I want to forget. I just remember it being slow the last time. O yes they serve wine. Out of a small wine fridge they probably bought at walmart. They do have a wine rack. With wine they probably bought from walmart. Do I need to describe the servers and owners? I hope this is enough to clarify that I have been to this place. I have mentioned the food. The look of the place and the service. O the bathrooms are past the servers stations in the back and now well Accessible to those with disabilities. I hope this review is kept up.
