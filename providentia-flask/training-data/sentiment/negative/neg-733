One of the worst taco shops I've ever been to- definitely the worst in Phoenix. Their dry and bland burritos lacked fresh authentic ingredients and were replaced by an excess of what tasted like unseasoned beans straight out of the can. The disappointingly small portions of rice and beans would have usually bothered me but after one bite the rest ended up in the trash anyway. 

The service was terrible- and we got it to go! They confused our order, couldn't remember which burrito was which, and while we were waiting we couldn't help but notice how dirty the silverware was on their appropriate abundance of unoccupied dining tables. 

A must skip restaurant in a market that's  abundant with stellar Mexican food in every neighborhood.
