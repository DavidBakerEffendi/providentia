My mom in disbelief wanted to buy BBQ take out from Sam woo because she thought this place was good,  just like the one in LA. We order roast duck, chicken  and BBQ pork. 

BBQ pork was fresh when we got it, it came out fresh in front of our eyes.  The color and the char was there. But eating it was a disappointment because the nice piece of red BBQ pork was just food coloring and nothing else. We were fooled by the looks of the item. There was no taste to it, totally bland. Only color.... 

The chicken was over marinated by salt. The meat was rough. There was no possible way for my family to eat it because it was too salty. I know my mom would hate me if I threw the chicken out, so I suggested maybe we can make porridge out of it? I don't think the chicken porridge would taste any good either. But it's in the fridge. Maybe I'll throw it out tomorrow without letting her know? 

Lastly, we had the roast duck. It actually wasn't bad. They had the duck right....  But hours later, I felt very thirsty, hinting that there was a lot of msg. It was weird cuz I haven't had msg over shock in a long time. 

I'm not going back here again. Originally, I just wanted to prove my mom wrong about their food. Although I succeeded in proving my mom wrong about their food but I really shouldn't attempt the idea of letting her try this place out. It was a bad choice on my end.
