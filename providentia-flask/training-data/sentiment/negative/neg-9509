We went here for Christmas  eve hoping for a nice family holiday meal. Instead, we had a horrible experience at this place. We had an order for 5-6 dishes and only the fried rice came out, 45 minutes after we placed our order! Ridiculous. The restaurant kept telling us it was busy yet the place was half full and every other table was getting their food, including people who arrived AFTER us. We decided to leave after waiting for over an hour. We were kind enough to leave them $20 for fried rice, the people there didn't seem to care we were leaving and never apologized or anything. An absolutely horrible experience. These people need to learn the basics of customer service. We went to Best Friend down the street instead and had an excellent experience. Mainly, we got the food we ordered in a decent amount of time! Shame on Happy Jade!
