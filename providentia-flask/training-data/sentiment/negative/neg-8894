The food was pretty bad.  The Lemonade seemed to be from concentrate, and not mixed correctly, the fries had a very strange taste, which reminded me of a sugar substitute.  The burger was very thin, and the sandwich as a whole tasted basically like ketchup and bread.   The staff did not tell me that I would be charged extra for lettuce and tomato, and I did not realize until I looked at my receipt.  The amount of lettuce and tomato on the sandwhich was very small.

The food is very expensive, especially since it seems to be of very low quality.  It was really the worst meal I have had in a long time.  They now have swing dances right next to Dynamite Burgers, which is why I was there when I got dinner there.   It would be a convenient place to eat if I am there for swing dancing, but based on my experience they are missing the chance to get as much business from that as they could.  I have no desire to eat there again, and would not recommend it.
