MAJOR FAIL.  Went to grab some food at the deli. Drove all they way there gave my order which the main reason was for soup with matzo balls.  Get all the way back home and found the screwed my order.  
So if there is a next time I go grab takeout and you are behind me don't get nuts while I stop and go through the whole order piece by piece. Last time I leave a big top too guys
