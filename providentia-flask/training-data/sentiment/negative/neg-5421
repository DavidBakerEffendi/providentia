In Scotland We call these places "greasy spoons" 

In a greasy spoon you get cheap food and friendly service, you ask don't expect the tables and chairs to be modern and the decor to look quite worn 

This place ticks the box of worn, tables and general decor is greasy spoon looking 

In a greasy spoon .... Even tho it's worn.... It's clean..... This place is filthy .... I'm surprised how the Canadian food agency allows this place to serve food 

On entering I sat down and my partner ordered a coffee .... I went to ask for tea and off the guy went without even looking in my direction...... 10 mins passed, no coffee and not even ordered yet.... Called him over .... Ordered and asked for My tea.... Reminded him of the coffee 

I moved my arm at this point and realised it was stuck to the table! 

Now ... Greasy spoon.... Cheap food ..... Well this place isn't, I've been in much nicer establishments and paid less money than their menu is charging 

My food came ..... They added ingredient not on the menu ...... The home fries came with onions ......I hate onions and if this was advertised I'd have said not to put the onions in 

They took it away to replace the home fries easily enough 

I expected a larger portion too.... It's a greasy spoon and not cheap so where is the large helping

Then we found ants crawling around our table .... Pointed out to the server who shrugged smiled and left never to return 

Well buddy I'll never return either
