I ordered the teriyaki chicken, which is apparently their specialty, and priced accordingly.  It was $7 for a medium sized bowl and drink.  The chicken was mediocre and the rice was kinda gummy.  

Even still, this wouldn't have warranted the one star until I bit into a chunk of bone that they forgot to sift out.  Nasty.
