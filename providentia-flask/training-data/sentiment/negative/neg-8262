To my fellow food critics, it has come to my attention that this restaurant has been feeding us rat poison.  You may think I am exaggerating, but I am not.  The line was outrageous and full of psychotic people.  For example this man just cut into the middle of the line with his psychotic girlfriend.  She kept on rambling on and on, if it were up to me I would send away to a mental hospital.
     Okay, let's get to the food.  We paid 35.99+tax for a descent meal.  At first we were looking forward to eating the snow crabs, I tried a little bit and spit it right out.  IT WAS COLD!  But, the most annoying thing was when I started to get dessert.  I was looking forward to eating Crème brûlée, but the lady in front of me had already taken the last one.  I asked the chef if there was anymore or if she was going to make anymore, and I was sure she was whispering Spanish to me, like do I look Spanish.  I don't recommend the lemon tarts, key lime pie, or lemon meringue, it's too sour and the meringue was not made right.
     Overall, this was completely terrible.  Service was horrendous, the waitress kept on correcting, like boi did even graduate high school Felicia.  Thank you for listening to my tips and comments.
