If you like baby roaches running by the food at the buffet, than go eat here. I will never step foot back in this casino ever again. After complaining to the front desk and better business bureau, we never got an apology of any kind.  Where there are baby roaches, there are more and more, it's like a disease that spreads. YUCK!
