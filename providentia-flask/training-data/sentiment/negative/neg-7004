The owner of State St Brats is racist and has no business doing business in Madison Wisconsin!! To discriminate someone based off the way they look is overt racism!! Madison has long sense been a city of peace and love and equality and we don't need this restaurant destroying our community and our moral values!! I called in asking about Mark Zuckerberg and he was rude to me and was damn near interrogating me he never gave me his name but he was quick to hang up on me and kept saying "WHAT DO YOU WANT!!!" Someone who runs a business like that does not deserve one cent of my money!!! Please avoid State St Brats at all cost!!
