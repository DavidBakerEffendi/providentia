I live in gilbert. Called the Gilbert location listed on website. I use to call this number all the time, but the store was under renovation.. understandable, yes. But they gave me another number to call in gilbert, called them they said no your not near us, they must  have been mistaken.. Ok... So called the other number they gave me, and they transferred me again!!! This time the number I was given was for Tempe!!! The managers don't do anything and they keep saying sorry, but after the fourth time being transferred I am not happy, I just simply wanted a sandwich and side, but I am never calling again after that "incident" they call it. Just damn unprofessional.
