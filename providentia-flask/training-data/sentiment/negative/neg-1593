I suggested eating here tonight because usually the service is decent and the food is good. Tonight the service was absolutely awful! It took FOREVER to get a server and then it was order and wait and wait...it took over 20 minutes just to get guacamole, an appetizer! We had 3 kids meals, fish tacos and street tacos. It took 10 minutes to get our drinks and I was done with my margarita and would have ordered another one of it hadn't taken the server over 15 minutes AFTER I FINISHED to even ask me if I wanted another. I literally said if you had asked me 10 minutes ago I would have said yes. Utterly ridiculous that our food took 40 minutes to get to our table considering that we had 3 KIDS meals! We won't be going back.
