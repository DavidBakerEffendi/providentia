Terrible service!!! If I could give them zero stars I definitely would!! I think the service in this bar is probably the worst in all Calgary ... I can't think right now in a place with a worst service than here!!

I just came for drinks with a friend.. And first they told us that it was too busy and there was no place available... Then some people from inside offer us a couple seats at the bar... So we stayed... I ordered a wine and it was really bad!! Tasted like alcohol!! Just disgusting, so I asked the bartender if he could change it  and he said no, because he already served... And in my glass was only a little as most of the wine was in the bottle and I never touched it!! Soooo... I just ordered the bill and left!  THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE WORST SERVICES IN CALGARY!! I do not recommend anyone to come here!! I have been in more than 200 places in this city and nothing is as bad as this one!!
