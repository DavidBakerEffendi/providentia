I was on vacation in Las Vegas and I was craving Sam Woo food. I thought that this Sam Woo would be just as good as the ones I eat at in SGV. I was so wrong! I ordered salt and pepper fish and the fish was not hot, the salt and pepper pork chops had about 5 pieces on the plate, and the sweet and sour fish had minimal sauce. On top of the food not tasting good, I don't know how 3 sides, rice, and hot tea turned into an $80 bill. FYI a dish in the San Gabriel Valley is under $10 a dish for lunch and under $15 for dinner for simple Chinese food- and, it tastes so much more satisfying that this LV Sam Woo. I mean, I'm glad I tried it so I know never to go back. I would recommend going to a buffet to get Chinese food instead..
