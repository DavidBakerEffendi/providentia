We popped in here on our way home one evening after another event.

It was a Wednesday evening so it wasn't overly busy.  Our service was fine... at first.  We seated ourselves and it didn't take too long for someone to bring menus and take our drink orders.  Our drinks took a bit and the server came back to ask us a question regarding one.  At that point I decided to change my order and asked if they were being made yet.  She said no and that the bartender would probably be glad I changed my mind(I was going to get a blended drink, but decided on a martini).  I don't really care if a beverage is a pain in the ass to make... I don't want to basically be told I'm a pain in the ass customer because I ordered that.  

Moving on.  We ordered sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo and the lobster mac n cheese with bacon on top to share.  The fries were far too salty, but still yummy.. and it is pub food after all.  I found them spicy, but that seems to be the norm with yam or sweet potato fries everywhere lately.  The lobster mac n cheese was pretty good.  It had real bacon on top.  I'm not a fan of bacon so hubby had mine.  The food was definitely edible.

The service, on the other hand, sucked. We waited for ever for our food.  We waited for condiments, for utensils for one of us, for our tab,for dessert etc.  The ice cream on the dessert was terrible.  You could tell it had melted and been refrozen.  It tasted and felt terrible to eat.  I ordered another drink(and so did my hubby)and we ended up leaving without getting them it took so long.  Thankfully we were not charged for them.  We asked for water and never got them.  The service was terrible.  I would not go back.  Definitely would not recommend them for large groups.  We were only two people and they couldn't serve us adequately.
