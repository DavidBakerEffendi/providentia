I threw it out. I came at 5:29pm and must have received chicken left over from lunch. Hard as a rock, dry and inedible. This location does not do enough volume to provide a consistently edible product. Someone has to be in charge on sight to decide when to throw out old product. Who ever it was on my visit obviously did not.
