The food is ok, nothing special. They serve Chinese, Korean and Japanese food. Service is alright. However, I don't think I will ever come back here. Both me and my boyfriend didn't feel well after eating their food. ( We had 2 special rolls and sashimi platter). I guess the kitchen is not very clean. Don't come here if you have a sensitive stomach.
