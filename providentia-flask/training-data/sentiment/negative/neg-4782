Sam Woo is a Chinese popularity name you would recognized if you are Chinese and in Los Angles and you are hungry for a darn good Cantonese style BBQ. 

In Vegas, Sam Woo USED to be the "IT" place to go to in Chinese food. Because not much Chinese restaurants back in the days.. so you're stuck! 

Sam Woo has always been conceited! Always leaving us disappointed with the service and our appetite...Always leaving still hungry, a stomach full of grease and a mouth full of desiring for H2O for rest of the day because they used so much MSG. and a big chunk of money from our wallet! Food is really mediocre that goes perfectly with their crappy service that yells at the guests for just standing because they're isn't any place else to stand! 

Sam Woo is best known for their BBQ and noodles and rice dish, but when you ordered that, the waiter gives you a nasty dirty attitude for ordering the cheap stuff. (Which is NOT cheap!) How the heck do you get a wonton soup wrong in a Chinese restaurant?.. well they do! add a couple spoonful of MSG into a barely warm tap water and frozen wontons and voila! GROSS! 

These days... They're are so much more Chinese food around Las Vegas, this is the last place I will ever step in! Mark my words!
