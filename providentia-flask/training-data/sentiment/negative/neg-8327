WATCH OUT FOR THEIR PRICES!

Don't get delivery from this place without VERY CAREFULLY checking the price before you commit to an order!  You've been warned!

One of the last time I ordered from here - I wondered why my small order was about $50.

Well, I figured it out.  I just called them - because I was thinking of ordering again - but I was a little cautious, and I asked how much it would be for 12 pieces of chicken ONLY.  Just chicken - no fries, nothing else.

OVER TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS.  Is that with tax you ask?  NO.

Does that include delivery?  NO.

Just a bit of chicken and it's almost thirty bucks!!!!!  And they still add tax and a delivery fee ON TOP OF THAT.

NOW I understand why my last delivery was SO EXPENSIVE.

Watch out for these guys.  DON'T order without getting a breakdown of the price before you order.

Unless you don't care about money.
