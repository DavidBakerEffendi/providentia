My boyfriend got up to go to the bathroom. I had noticed that they changed the bowl for the Mac and cheese, so I asked about it. The server said yes, it was smaller. The manager cut in and said no, it was the same. Smirked at me and asked if he was going to have to prove it. I asked him not to smirk at me. He leaned on my table and told me he had NOT smirked at me. At this point I'm essentially trapped between him and the wall. Now, if you're picturing this at home, you also need to know that I was wearing a brace on my leg, so he knew I was disabled when he made the move to intimidate me. I said, please don't be so aggressive with me. He informed me that I didn't need to be rude to him, that he was TRYING to be polite, and repeated that the bowls were the same. I said, that's fine, okay, please step away from me. He said, I'm the general manager, are you going to be a problem? Escalated the whole thing way beyond a simple question. This is the place we went on our first date, so it's someplace really special to me, and now I don't feel like I can go back. I'm very hurt and disappointed.
