Response to Dylan T.  for Tom's Urban:    We did send it back after waiting an hour to order & another who knows what before we got our food back.  1st time we got our tacos, it was ice cold.  2nd time, it was rare & nothing but fat.  We were so frustrated, we didn't wanna send it back a 3rd time.  The salad was also limp & old, obviously straight out of a bag.  Crappy food & service.  I live here & actually work for a sister company on the strip.  I took my cousins there from out of town, pretty embarrassed I did.  For 4 people, we paid $180!  Btw, how can the cook mess up on grilled cheese sandwich? -cold too!  I also witnessed another disappointed patron who returned their food & eventually left pissed off.  U can relay this review to your VP of Operations, Doug Winter.  It was just a terrible experience going to your property
