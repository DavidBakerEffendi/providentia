I can tolerate the Olive Garden, but what I found is that in a lot of the chains that are particularly in Las Vegas is that the level of quality that I expect coming from the Olive Garden (as low as it is) isn't kept up.

I'll admit that we were a large group and the manager came out to apologize before we complained that there was a backlog in the kitchen and that was the reason it took so long. But there was also an issue with the level of heat on our dishes. They weren't hot and out waiter assured us that the food came out hot.

The Minestrone (other than the heat factors) just didn't taste right and didn't sit well with me and by the time we got our mains I was just thinking to myself "why?".

We also got conflicting responses to what we would and wouldn't be charged if we made substitutions or additions to our meal which was upsetting.

I think I'll skip this location next time...
