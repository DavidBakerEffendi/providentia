Poor service, had to sit there and ask my wife continuesly about why we have been waiting SO long for our waitress to bring us food, to bring us service etc, we talked to the "owner" who cared about nothing we had to say, only cared about the money. The manager did not refund us, did not give us a discount, as a first time customer here for me, and a returning customer for my wife, as she has grown up here this will be the LAST time we ever come to this place. Did i forget to mention that me and my 9 month prego wife left HUNGRY??? Even after telling the manager that we pretty much paid $70 for bread...  Yeah! We will be disputing the bill. My wife is truely hurt by the way we were treated tonight, she tried to surprise me with this "fantastic" place.....  Thanks for reading my review, and please remember, you can get way better service at Red lobster for the same amount you would pay here. Please contact me with any questions or concerns you may have , 480-269-1834.
