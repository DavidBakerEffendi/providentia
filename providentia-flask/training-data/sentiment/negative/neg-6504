The new Feast Buffet reopened earlier than the expected July 20th date at Palace Station, so, as dedicated locals, we checked it out.  Who doesn't like a day with buffet and gambling and all around decadent behavior?  We were told that this buffet is the prototype for how all of the Station Casinos will eventually have their buffets, which, if that's the case, will be the end to our time of enjoying Station Casino buffets.  To begin with, the lighting is awful -- it's bright and stark and gives the area the look and feel of a hospital or school cafeteria.  Food selection is smaller than most Station casino buffets, but looked okay -- sparse, but okay.  But the desserts!!  Ack!!  Talk about sparse!  One of the joys of going to Station Casino Feast Buffets were the pies, and there were no pies!  They used to have the most wonderful coconut cream, banana cream, chocolate cream, lemon meringue, pumpkin, cherry, apple, etc., but the cooks told us that they're 'no more,' that they now have 'carnival type desserts, like caramel corn' (!) and some silly looking bits of rolled up cake-y things (eek), and other equally disappointing items  They did have some nice looking carrot cake...but it was in the NSA (no sugar!) category...and what's the point of that when you're trying to be a glutton (excluding diabetic gluttons, of course)??   All of which means that, like the extinct pies, we will also be 'no more' to the Palace Station Feast Buffet, or to any of the Station Casinos that morph into harshly lit environments that don't have our locally beloved comfort food desserts.  Makes us sad, but it looks like Boyd properties or the Strip will start getting our money when we and our buddies descend into the depths of buffet and gambling debauchery.
