I don't recommend this place unless you are sitting right at the main revolver with the chefs. The sashimi pieces here are dried. The price is good, but the distribution of the sushi plates on the revolver is the major problem here. Nobody bother to put the freshly done rolls on the far end of the revolver. I will not come back since this one is the worse out of all the restaurants I have tried.
