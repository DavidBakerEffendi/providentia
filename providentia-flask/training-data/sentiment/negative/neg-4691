Well, you expect some kind of hospitality when you are in a restaurant, making you feel at ease. Delhi Palace does not have it in them. In general, the servers sound rude and they don't look happy to serve you. As far as the food is concerned, it is not what you expect from an Indian restaurant. The curries were a bit bland and were very thin for an Indian curry, Naan was pretty good. All in all, that was the first time I went to Delhi Palace and it turned out to be the last one.
