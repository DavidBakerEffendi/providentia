DISGUSTING!! Ive been to other Sam Woo restaurants and this location is a shame in the chain! 

First we were ignored for 15 mins and when I felt something on my foot, it was a freaking chopstick and dirty tissues on the floor! GROSS!

My dads ginger ck with pinapple tasted like FISH?? And tell me why the creme was pink?? My beef chow mein was soggy and our duck was the skinniest lil thing -_-

Maybe im spoiled in what good chinese food should SMELL and TASTE like, but couldnt they clean up the place, spray some air freshner, and get better employees to make up for their lack of good chefs? BAH never again!
