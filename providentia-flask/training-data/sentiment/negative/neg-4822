This was the most DISGUSTING food I have ever eaten. FULL OF MSG!!!

I got the curry pad thai which was the only option that could make vegan. The chefs had no idea how to make it vegan even though their menu clearly stated that they could make most options vegan upon request.   

Their website said that their food is healthy but it contains a horrific amount of MSG. I have a severe sensitivity to MSG so I became incredibly ill. 

When I explained to the cashier that my meal was disgusting she did not do anything to rectify the situation. 

WORST FOOD IN THE WHOLE FOOD COURT. NEVER GO THERE.
