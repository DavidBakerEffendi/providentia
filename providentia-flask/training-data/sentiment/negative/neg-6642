Terrible service. Walked in, sat at the bar for maybe 6 mins or more. The dirty glasses was left on the bar it has not been wiped or clean from food being left in the counter. Remind you it is a slow night and the bartender has not approached us or greeted us yet. He walked passed us at 3 times and served someone else that walked in after us. Never seen such a lazy ass bar tender who the hell wants to sit at a unclear bar. We just left. Nothing like he other Hickory Taverns.
