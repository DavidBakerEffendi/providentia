Cool atmosphere. Just wish I could bring my own beer and food. Why? The food is horrible and like most reviews, the beer isnt cold. Service is terrible. I waited at the bar for 10 minutes until the bartender even looked at me. Didnt help either that our bartender told us he had been puking during his shift because he had too much fun the night before. 

Lastly the bartender didn't use an ice scooper, just dipped the glass with his bare hands into the ice. Pretty nasty.
