I continue to give this place my business over 4 years and  I have stopped eating in because the service is garbage. I have been getting Togo but today will be my last time; literally my food is sitting there ready and server walk past several times I actually ended up grabbing my food and leaving! This place is crap the seating is ridiculous when eating in they won't even open the other side no matter how many people are waiting! Save your money and go else where!!
