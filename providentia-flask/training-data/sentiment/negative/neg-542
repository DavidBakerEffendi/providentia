Burgers cooked to order, but fries are re-fried to order and over cooked. I returned my regular fries because it was not only very very salty they were not fresh, they were re-fried poorly. The fries were not golden brown, it was just overdone. Some soggy and some too over cooked that the fries are hollow and extra oily when you bite into them. 
When I got the new batch of fries in 1 minute (which means the fries were not made fresh), it just looked liked the basket of fries I returned was re-fried again! And still looked even more over cooked. I just returned the fries again and left. The cashier did not try to fix the problem by offering to redo a fresh batch or a refund.
