It was probably my mistake to order a chicken wrap at a wing place but this was the saddest excuse for food. It included maybe 5 bits of fake chicken slices and a lot of lettuce. They really need to take it off the menu if they're going to serve this crap.

The wings were decent but nothing can save them from that poor example of a chicken wrap.
