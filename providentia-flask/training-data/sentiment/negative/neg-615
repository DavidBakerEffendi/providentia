Confrontational Management! We came with 30 people tonight to celebrate birthdays, yet again. We were sat at 3 tables and had two different servers and 3 different chefs. 2 of the 3 tables had very poor service, from slow drinks and empty water to cold rice and dry chicken. When it was brought to managements' attention, the gentleman was incredibly confrontational which was completely out of line. We eventually saw another manager who attempted to smooth things over but they likely lost a large group of frequenters of Shinto.
