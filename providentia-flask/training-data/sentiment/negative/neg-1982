Haven't been to Sonny's in a while and some family friends invited me when I came up to Charlotte to visit. We were seated promptly and that was about the only good thing about the place. We had to ask the waitress for EVERYTHING. I ordered cornbread and got garlic bread instead, so she went and got me some cornbread. After touching it, it was cold. As I requested a new one she said they serve them at room temperature... Something I've never heard of as you serve cornbread hot. We constantly had to ask for refills as well. 

The food was plain. There was really no flavor to the chicken or the pork. Just seemed really flavorless and bland. I will not be going to Sonny's for another while.
