If I could give zero I would. This place is a pure disaster. As a platinum member I deserved to be treated as little better. First off everything is self serve and I mean everything. U want a drink you have to get it yourself. The service sucked. Everyone had an attitude problem. I didn't pay 150$ to get a rude ass reply on why I have to walk a mile to get an ice cube. The food was gross and very cold. Even the cookies were burned and rock hard. As a vegetarian I picked to eat here so everyone can find something to eat. Boy was I wrong. The trays were empty the ones that weren't had no labels on it so you had no idea what you were even eating.  I went to get a slice of pizza cause that's all I could find to eat and to my surprise everything had meat on it. Five pizza all ham...I asked him for plain cheese and his rude ass told me to get what's there. This place is a joke. I will never come here again. Worst service worst buffet worst restaurant.just worst everything in the state of Nevada. I'm disgusted.
