My husband heard about this new restaurant so we went to check it out.  The food was mediocre, but the service was HORRIBLE.  I had a chicken quesadilla and the chicken didn't have any flavor to it.  My husband enjoyed his chimichanga and said the rice on the side was awesome.  Our waitress let my husband's water glass get emptied twice and waited a while to fill it (a different waitress even stepped in to fill it once).  The service was very slow, and what really topped off the 2 star rating for me was our waitress talked us into ordering a banana burrito for dessert.  When this mysterious burrito actually showed up it was actually quite good but it took 20 minutes!  And the whole time we were waiting, our waitress walked around and avoided eye contact with us.  At one point she stopped by and said they were plating it up right now.  10 minutes later the thing actually arrived at our table (not by our waitress, and not accompanied by silverware to eat it (our waitress had taken all of our silverware when she cleared the plates)).  The burrito itself was tasty but the ice cream it comes with is nothing short of bizarre.  I think the base of the ice cream was chocolate (hard to tell), but it had all this weird unidentifiable stuff in it and it was just weird.

The best part of the entire meal was the chips and salsa served before dinner.  Their chips are thick and crispy and good.  They have a very limited selection on their menu and I just wasn't impressed with my food enough to get over the lousy service.

As an added ammendment to this review, my husband spent the entire night after eating here throwing up and has been continuing to throw up today.  We will never eat here again.
