Was having fun with my friends until I dropped my $20 bill and a female employee quickly ran up and took it right in front of me..  kinda like when  kids break a pi√±ata and run to get the candy.. to me that was a shady thing to do how do you wanna have loyal customers or any business when the employees steal right under the customers nose makes you wonder if they steal from the company too
