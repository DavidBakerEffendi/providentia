Totally not impressed, in fact highly annoyed. The service very poor,  starting with the fact it's not clear if you sit or order at the counter. No greeting upon entering, so we sat ourselves. We hand to grab our own menus sitting on a table. The server was all business and not friendly, she didn't even stand around long enough for me finish ordering my smoothie. The food was okay. We will definitely not be returning.
