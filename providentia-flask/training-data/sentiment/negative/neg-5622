I chose this place for summerlicious after reading really good reviews and menu selection.

HOWEVER. i think coincidentally either the chef was on holiday or he had a grudge against me.

Appetizer: mussels...SALTY. one sip of the broth and i chugged my glass of wine AND water

they brought the mains out before clearing the table, so my girls and I helped the waitress out and piled our dishes neatly so she can put our mains down.

Main: swordfish....nice thick and juicy cut. It was cooked well, however it was over seasoned and on the salty side. At this point im still waiting for the waitress to refill our glasses. OH and the dish comes with deep fried avocados rolls, so i thought yes literally deep fried avocado fries of some sort. Get this, deepfried california roll with a thin slice of avocado that you can barely see. DKM, it was like all hope was lost.

dessert: Cereal Milk Crème Brûlée aka Traditional crème brûlée served with a cornflake brittle. mmmmmmMMMMMMM doesn't that sound so delish? but SURPRISE!  it was a less than average traditional creme brulee, it was liquidy and not solid.

I think this place has potential but I am very disappointed in the food and service. The whole point of summerlicious is to try the quality of the restaurant's offering so that you'll remember to come back to try other things and recommend to others. Unfortunately that won't be the case for me :(
