I used to love this place. They had decent food and my husband loved the Authentic Philly Cheesesteak. The last 2 times that I ordered salad, there was no salad dressing include, which is required to even place a salad order. The first time, I didn't complain because it could have been a fluke. But on Monday September 3rd, I place and order for a steak salad. Now mind you, the steak salad in Pittsburgh includes french fries on it. Not only was the order 30 minutes late, with no communication, but again there was no salad dressing, 2 cherry tomatoes cut in half, a couple of rings of raw onion, and no french fries. Granted the order was placed on a holiday night and they wanted to get out work, but please don't short change the customer and please respond to customer complaints. They have lost a customer and it's sad because I really liked the food there.
