We had a group reservation for 2 lanes for 7-9pm on a Sunday night. Called and confirmed the Friday before for a friend's birthday. When we showed up, they claimed to not have our reservation and that there were two separate parties that had booked the upstairs and downstairs venues. Although the manager apologized, she said there was nothing that could be done as all lanes were already reserved until 8pm. Ok, fine. We went to ABC Tavern across the street with out 15 person party for some food and beers. Two of us tried to go back at 8pm when one of the private parties were supposed to finish to ask if we could reserve a couple lanes then since they supposedly close at MIDNIGHT. We were told by Alex at the front desk that it was company policy to not take new reservations after private parties and to "not ruin this for her." Whatever that meant. Saw later her and a bunch of her co-workers at ABC Tavern at around 9pm. Ridiculous. Love bowling with friends, love Italian food, cannot stand lazy, unprofessional, incompetent people. Ugh.
