This afternoon I ordered delivery, which is typical for me when ordering from pizza hut. I've never ran into any issues until today. My delivery arrives, I tip the driver and he goes on his way. I order 1 pizza and 2 orders of wings totaling $50. When I open my wings I notice they are incorrect I look at my receipt to ensure I ordered them correctly and proceed to call the store to see if we can get this cleared up. Trevor, the store manager, answers the phone and after I tell him the issue he decides he's heard enough and decides to get an attitude. 1st off as a manager you should know that talking to an adult like a child is not the way to resolve things. 2nd off how do you get an attitude with a customer for a mistake YOU made? I didn't want credit, I didn't want free food I just wanted the wings I ordered and I was willing to pick them up. But the manager didn't give me the opportunity to tell him that. I asked for his managers information which he would not provide me stating that he would not give me the information because I was not being civil and then hangs up on me. By now I'm fuming, such a small, easy to fix mistake is now something I have to comment on. Nonetheless I  went down to the store, demanded a refund, his name and his district managers information. They say they do not have a corporate number because they are a franchise so probably gave me some BS name, phone number, and email. I cannot believe the lack of customer service at this location, I order pizza hut 2-3 times a month and order for a family of 5 so you can imagine the total cost I spend each time. I will gladly take my business elsewhere.
