I'm floored at how this place has good reviews. Popped in for a lunchtime meal and I'm having major regrets. My family is Latin American and my boyfriend with the same roots agrees that this is probably the worst Mexican joint we've ever been to.

Guac is way too liquidy, the food is made with low quality ingredients and you can taste it! Won't be back
