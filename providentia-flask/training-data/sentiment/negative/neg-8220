Very very slow service, it took the server 15 minutes to come to our table just to welcome us and ask what we want to drink.
And another 10 minutes to bring the drinks. 
The salad was very small and when we asked why yesterday it was much bigger the server said he doesn't know .
Definitely not coming here anymore.
