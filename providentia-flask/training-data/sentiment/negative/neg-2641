Visiting here from Toronto for the weekend and saw this place across the street from my hotel, went in sat down and looked over the menu. The Rocky Mountain Waffle sounded really awesome but then nobody came to my table for about 10-15 minutes, I was seated on the patio and the place wasn't even busy. I can't understand why nobody would come over and take my order, lots of eye contact was made and nothing was done. I'll never return to this place again, something so simple and nothing
