My husband and I sat at the bar over Memorial Day weekend to have a few beers.  The female bartender was accommodating and nice enough.  We were having a generally good time until my husband got up to use the restroom.  While I was sitting alone I yawned.  Upon seeing this a random male server made an offensive and racist remark about the size of my mouth/yawn and how it correlates with the color of my husbands skin.  The gentlemen sitting across from me were in just as much shock at the comment.  Needless to say I will not be returning.  
Lucky for that server I didn't share this with my husband until we were a safe distance from the casino.
