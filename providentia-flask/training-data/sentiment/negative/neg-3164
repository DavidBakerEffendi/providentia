My bf and I were so excited to try this place last night and we were really expecting greatness and the food was bland it had no flavor to it. I got the chicken burger and he got the mushroom burger. As soon as we left I told him it was ehh nothing special. Fries weren't seasoned and the burgers were so plain I had to add hot sauce to try to give it some flavor. I didn't even end up finishing my burger and just tossed it would've rated it a good 2/3 stars based on food. Fast forward to this morning I wake up to realize I got food poisoning from this place. I've been throwing up every few hours it's currently 3am and can't keep anything but water down. I knew something was off with that breaded chicken. I shouldn't of ate here. The worst mistake ever. I knew this gave me food poisoning because all I had for breakfast was toast peanut butter. And my throw up showed me what was wrong.... let me tell you it was chicken chunks and pieces of fries. I should've known something was up when the girl grabbed my drink for a refill after touching and changing the trash bag. Be careful y'all!
