Normally I love this place! The food is great but the service is not. I called to place an order for pickup at 8:30pm. Just two salads that's it. They told me it wouldn't be ready until 9:45pm, no joke. Are you freaking kidding me? The waitress said it was because of their ordering system. I don't know their system but it seems like a terrible one if you have to wait over an hour for salads.
