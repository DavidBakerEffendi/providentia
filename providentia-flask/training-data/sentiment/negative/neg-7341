I ordered food on skipthedishes and it said the delivery driver had arrived..I went downstairs (I live in an apartment) to see if he got lost because it took awhile. The app marked it was delivered and it never arrived!! I called the restaurant several times 9 mins after they were closed and left voicemails. Nobody answered the phone. I am super disappointed and extremely hungry! Unhappy with the service and the delivery driver.
