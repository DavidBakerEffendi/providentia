Worst Customer service that I've experienced in a long time. I called to place an order and asked if their wings are breaded like most wing spots. The employee said yes so I ordered the combo with wings with bone & boneless wings and sause on the side. The reviews for this place were terrible but still thinking its a well known place maybe they've changed but no surprise here. Wings look shitty and the hostesses that were waiting on customers were throwing F bombs and using foul language in front of a family which was waiting to be seated. Such a shame, never coming here again and will stick to reading reviews and dodge places like this.
