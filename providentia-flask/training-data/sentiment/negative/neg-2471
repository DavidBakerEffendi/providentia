It is very sad to know that you close before your posted closing times on Sundays. We came in just before 8:00 on Sunday night. Two young men told us that they were already closed. I think they just wanted to go home early. I'm a loyal customer and being pregnant I was really craving a salad. I'll think twice before returning to this location.
