Pros:
-Tuna Tataki is amazing, not sure if it's limited to 1 per table though.
-Rock shrimp is also amazing, it's lightly battered fried shrimp with a sweet and salty garlic sauce
-Other cooked dishes were also properly done, although the tempura were a bit too greasy and left me feeling a bit queasy afterwards
-Sashimi is fresh and they have Tuna sashimi for dinner
-Attentive staff, great service

Cons:
-This is the deal breaker for me: the rice they used for sushi was barely seasoned, it was bland and ruined the taste of every maki we tried. The ingredients they used for the sushi were great, all fresh fish and properly prepared eel/shrimp etc but without properly prepared and seasoned rice, it just tastes like seaweed, fish & soy sauce.
-Stay away from the Philadelphia roll. They make it by using a huge chunk of regular salmon + a thin sliver of smoked salmon + a chunk of cream cheese. The sliver of smoked salmon was literally half a CM wide. Anyone who has had proper Philly roll knows that there shouldn't be anything other than smoked salmon + cream cheese, they were obviously trying to cut corners since smoked salmon costs more than fresh.

Overall, a pretty disappointing experience considering all the positive reviews here. I've tried over 10 AYCE sushi places in Toronto and this ranks in the bottom 3. It really is a shame because if only they would take the time to prepare the sushi rice properly, then I'm sure this would be the best AYCE I've ever had since almost everything else was there. 

Personally, I think I know why the rice is so bland, not only does it save time and sushi vinegar, but when we dined there, I noticed that we were the only Asian customers in the restaurant. Everyone else was Caucasian. I'm not being racist here, but maybe Caucasians prefer sushi rice to be more bland? I also noticed that all the maki were rolled inside out (rice on the outside, seaweed inside) which was invented because Caucasians didn't like the look of seaweed on the outside. Most other sushi restaurants don't bother doing this because it takes more time to prepare the rolls, so I think Sushi D does this intentionally to cater to the Caucasian clientele which is perfectly fine because they seem to be doing quite well. Just not recommended for Asian taste buds maybe :)

Bottom line: Go here if you like cooked japanese food + fresh sashimi, stay away if you like sushi or maki or anything that contains sushi rice.
