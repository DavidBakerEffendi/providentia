Just Ewww. I have been seeing Farmer Boys locations all over town, but never had the desire to try it. We were in the area and originally planned on going to Egg Works for breakfast, but the place was way too crowded. Even the McDonalds next door was crazy, so we ended up here. Looking at their menu, the food didn't look too bad. But then again, the pictures are never the same as the actual food right?

Seemed like a big portion type of place and I didn't want too much food, so I ordered the Sausage Biscuit and Gravy Bowl. It's amazing how so many restaurants screw up something simple like this. The gravy was very bland, the sausage was super fatty and the biscuit was dry. Thumbs down for serving Pepsi products as well. The other thing that annoyed me was that they didn't seem to have any ventilation. The whole time I was in the restaurant, it was foggy and I could really smell the smoke from their grill.

Not much else to say. If their food was actually decent, they could make more money when Egg Works, McDonalds or other places in the area are crowded.
