SHOULD HAVE JUST WENT TO DENNY'S OR IHOP

Stopped by this morning for breakfast. We were seated right away by the hostess. We sat for 15 minutes and there were no servers in sight. I finally got impatient and went to let the hostess know that no server has come to take our order yet. The hostess had to walk to the back of the restaurant to let the server know that we had been waiting for over 15 minutes.

The server came immediately and apologized. She told us that the other server was on break and she had to cover both sides of the restaurant. A restaurant this size and only 2 servers?!!

I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak w/fruit for my side. It came with 2 eggs which I got over easy and a Strawberry Lemonade to drink. The Chicken Fried Steak was the worst I've ever tasted. Marie Callender's frozen Country Fried Chicken is 10 times better than this. 

My friend ordered the 10oz Sirloin Steak medium rare, B&G(biscuits and gravy), and an Iced Tea to drink. The steak was too tough. She said the gravy tasted like it was made from the powder gravy packets you buy at the grocery store. 

They have their AC on full blast so your food gets cold quick. We didn't even finish half of our food and we declined when our server asked us if we wanted a couple of boxes.

I don't think I'll ever come back to this restaurant.
