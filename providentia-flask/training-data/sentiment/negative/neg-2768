Bought the current Groupon and was excited to try this much "talked about" restaurant. Needless to say I was thoroughly disappointed. The hostess greeted me and asked how many in my party? I answered four, two adults, two children. After finding out my children were young, she asked me if I would like to be put in a corner. I promptly responded,  "No, why?" She said, "Well kids run around, scream, and can be disruptive." I said, "Well, my kids behave so I'm not really worried." Then, if that wasn't enough, she stated, "I just don't want you to be embarrassed." Oh my! That was just the beginning. The waiter, Angel, was condescending and did not offer any help when it came to the kids' selections. We ended up paying $16.00 per plate for spaghetti yet the adult portion was $18.95. Talk about a big rip off! We ended up paying $20.00 per child which included drinks. There was a gentleman circulating amongst guests but never said boo to us. The food was not extraordinary as previous reviews have stated. There are many Italian restaurants to be insulted and eat marginal food! We will NEVER be back!
