Today we stopped in for thr endless shrimp meals. Started with coleslaw which is shredded cabbage with a watery sauce that sticks to nothing-so basically uncooked raw cabbage=Trash. Wifes Ceasers salad was half fresh half wilted the dressing was ok.

The cheese biscuits arrived late 2 burnt 2 ok. 

Bad start to a meal. Thinking Pappadeaux from now on and its an hour and a half drive. Hopefully the shrimp is not bad as well. 

Both of us ordered one of our favorites the Shrimp Linguine Alfredo. Make sure you also order shrimp scampi to poor the sauce on the pasta. The sauce now rates below Walmarts bottled Alfredo sauce. At least Walmart brand is a thick creamy sauce unlike Red Lobsters watered down Alfredo. Today is day 1 of the ENDLESS SHRIMP. They are either watering it all down or all the food has gone way down hill. Only good shrimp of all the choices are scampi and Ginger shrimp. The citrus fiesta shrimp has what tastes like nacho cheese on top of extra chrispy shrimp. The old adage seafood and cheese is a very bad combo. All around us were complaints on the food. Bad salads, pasta nasty, hard rock biscuits, burnt food, ect.

Our waiter was oustanding considering everone was doing Endless Shrimp running his elderly legs off.
