Went here late night, brought it home and wish I didnt go there at all. The  food is gross. It looks shabby on the inside, couldnt expect much more from the food. I honestly believe that if a place looks like a dump 99% of the time the food reflects that. If you cant maintain your storefront why would the back be any better. Some owner need a good shake and slap. I don't mean if the decor is tacky or outdated. I mean if the place looks dirty and under kept. This place gave me that vibe. I dont want to see dirt and grit on the counter or walls. NOT DOWN. clean your shit please and thanks. Thats all I have to say.
