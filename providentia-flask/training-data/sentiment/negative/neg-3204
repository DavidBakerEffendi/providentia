This place is foul and decussating. Found a hair on top  of the burrito the minute the girl set it down. Sent it back. Waited and waited for a new one. Only because my kids were hungry. Surprise they brought out the same burrito. Just took off the hair. She said sorry it took so long. There is only two of us working today. Shame on you Wahoo management. Never eat here again .
