No stars! This place is serving up rodents! 
Picture this. First time visitors, myself and fiance(he has been there) sitting alone in the whole place and while waiting for my food I see a mouse scurry into a hole in the floor close to the drink dispenser.. I freak out because I am scared of rodents and the waitress comes to see what the commotion was about. I explained to her as I proceeded to move to another area still willing to give the food a shot because kitchen was located on opposite side of the place.. Disappointed again, Torta bread was hard and cold. Did not communicate this to the waitress, as I thought the mouse was enough for a comp! She tells us after giving us the check that the owner said he was going to have someone come out.... $3 discount given... 
This place will not last, too many delicious tortas and tacos out there.. THUMBS DOWN!
