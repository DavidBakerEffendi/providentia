Downgrading my review based on the owner's response. I never said I had any issue with prayers for their business. Don't slander me just because you don't know how to read customer reviews closely.

A weird experience. Food was decent, but the woman who appeared to be the owner was incredibly rude. Our waitress had a bad attitude to everyone there too, not just to us.

We arrived with the owner burning incense and praying at the front door. That was fine, but she kept us standing there for 5 min. and wouldn't let us sit down. As in, she blocked the entrance and wouldn't let us move around her to be seated.

A few people at other tables asked the waitress if she would recommend one drink over another, and her curt responses were so unpleasant. All I kept hearing was "I don't drink, if you want it just get it!" and "I don't know how that tastes. Get it, if you don't like it then oh well. It's your money." No one was giving the owner or waitress any sort of attitude.

They kept forgetting our order and coming back to confirm. What's so hard about 1 lb of shrimp, some fries, and a milk tea?? They forgot my drink and served it 45 min later. I had to ask 3 times. The restaurant was empty with the exception of 2 other couples there.

As a server, even if you don't eat the food there or don't drink yourself, you always hear from customers about what tastes great. You can make recommendations based on that, instead of giving a nasty attitude to paying customers.

There are plenty of other Cajun seafood places in the area so I won't be back. All the praying for money and return customers won't do you any good - how about you learn to be nice to customers and that way you won't lose them.
