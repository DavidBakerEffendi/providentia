First of all, I'd like to say Origin India does have GREAT food, their food is delicious, but, my desire of going back quickly vanished after getting to know how HORRIBLE their SERVICE was. It was the second time I went to the restaurant (Why? because I liked it the first time) so I brought 3 of my coworkers in the second time along with a coupon from Origin India, and here's exactly what the coupon said "Buy one entree, get another one 50% off, Max 4 people", so we have total of 4 entree that day, I'm 100% sure everyone here who read the coupon might think that we will pay two entree full price and get the other 2 entries half off since we ordered 4 total, but to my surprise, two waiters were arguing against me saying they only take one entree half off regardless of how many entree we have, but wait a minute, nothing on the coupon says there's a limitation, so that is when I know how LOW they treat their customers, they think we are stupid and can't read the coupon, I got frustrated and decided to be nice and pass along the coupon next table, and then the waiter immediately took my coupon away and said "Sorry the coupon is not transferrable", WOW, just WOW, long story short, we will NEVER EVER go back there again because of the horrible service, we will go to Ghandi instead, which is one block down from it, they have good food and good service and kids eat for free there too.
