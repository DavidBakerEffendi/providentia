We live in the neighborhood, and the first few times we went, it was nice.  A bit out of date, but the food was good and we generally had good experiences.  Last year when we got our tax return, we decided to celebrate there.  Our waitress was a bit too chatty, and at first, we just ignored her.  At one point early in our visit, I went outside with a friend to smoke (there were still people at our table), and she made a "dine and dash" joke (I assume it was a joke), which rubbed me the wrong way.  When we returned, she had brought out the wrong bottle of wine and some how this became our fault and a joke between her and other servers?!?  She was strange and the evening got weirder as time went on.  At the end of the night, she asked if we came to the restaurant often, and I mentioned we did on occasion and we were celebrating our tax return.  After we had paid our bill and were leaving she made an off color comment, saying she hoped we had enough money to come back.  A few months later we went back for burgers at the bar after work, and she happened to be hostessing, and she remembered us.  She said she was happy to see we had enough of our tax return left to come back.  I seriously don't know if she was kidding or a total jerk.  We are always dressed appropriately and tip well, maybe she doesn't understand why anyone under 65 would dine there.  We will unfortunately never will be going back again.......
