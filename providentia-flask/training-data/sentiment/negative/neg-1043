Awful, awful, awful service. Tables sit dirty forever (gross!) while they make customers wait. Drink orders not taken or refilled.
We went there at close to 8pm and the very limited selection of sushi looked *really* old.

I get that they might not want to fill up the belt later in the evening - but if that is the case then come to our table and ask what we would like to eat for crying out loud.

Because we did come there, after all, to eat food.

We left hungry and stopped elsewhere to get some food in the way home.

It appears that front of the house is run by an 18 year old who doesn't have the slightest idea of what she is doing. And she is really rude. Suggest they invest in a real manager.
