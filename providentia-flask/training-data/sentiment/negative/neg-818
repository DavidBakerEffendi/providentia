Remind me never to come to this location again please . I am sitting here now as we speak just because I wanted a simple bacon egg n cheese patty melt. When I came in no one spoke instead everyone in the kitchen sat and looked at me til I finally said hey everybody and kindly took a seat. As I was sitting I'm looking at all of the tables that hasn't been cleaned I finally found a end table that was clean. So as I'm sitting one of the girls yells from the kitchen hey do u know what u want ??? Ummm I acted like I didn't hear her so she could properly come to the table and take my order at this point I'm in shock. I swear if I wasn't so hungry I would have just got up and left !!! Don't let me forget to tell you how the waitress finally brings my food out and just slams it down to the table .This is ridiculous!!!
