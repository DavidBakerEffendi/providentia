One of the girls in our group needed a quick bite and none of the restaurants were open so we grabbed a couple chili dogs and an order of chili fries to soak up the alcohol. 
Our order was $30 and the most disgusting fast food I've ever had. How does chili have NO flavor? The dog was dry and flavorless. The fries were soggy and again FLAVORLESS!! I know they can get premium $'s in a hotel but at least sell a better product. Nathan's is famous? Really?
Must be a boardwalk thing - gross
