I've been to this mimis several times as I live close....I've never been impressed by the service.  Tho, today, Erik may have been the only redeeming quality about Mimi's today.  He hustled and was friendly to everybody. 
To start, the hostess, Kimberly was snotty. I was eating solo on a Friday just before 11am. She told me to sit and asked my name. I was the only person there at the time!! It took 8 mins to set up a table for me. I would hate to see her/them in action on a busy weekend morning. 
I always order the pommes Benedict but with muffins instead of potatoes. It use to be on the menu as florentine but has been replaced. For some reason, the kitchen doesn't want to make my breakfast this way for me, tho they reluctantly did. This dish was really the only reason to come to Mimi's. Guess I don't need to come here again now.
