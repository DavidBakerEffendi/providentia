If there was a direct line I would be complaining directly to the cashier working right now Stephen B because he and whomever else is working right now had time to make jokes with me but unable to get me my correct order even when being the only car in the drive thru. Having to triple check my bag is the new thing apparently... came to try the new nacho cheese fries and didn't get any nacho cheese dip. No cinnamon twists either. Offered me tap water when he said there was no more Baja blast though... sweet.
