VERY MISLEADING!  I bought out the restaurant for the entire night, but forgot to get it in writing. Overcharged us. Clearly tried to kick us out early. Succeeded. Food tasted great but AGAIN overcharged us!  $2K for a buffet. Nonsense. Bar was overpriced as well. The atmosphere was great - SANS the manager hounding me to pay the check. I bought the ENTIRE restaurant/bar out from 4PM until 3AM yet i was told i "went over my budget." Only go to this place if you're in the mood to piss away money. Almost $4,600.00 for 6 hours? Nothing like i was promised. EXTREMELY MISLEADING NEGOTIATION!! 0stars.
