Yo!! This location is nastttyyyyyy! So mad I didn't read the reviews before I ate there! The meat did taste weird and my pinto beans were funky!! Baja Fresh was Baja Funk. Beware of this location! 

While we were eating a little after 8:00pm they turned the lights off on us! And we were confused so I looked at the closing time. They close at 8:45? That's odd... 
But still how do you expect us to eat in the dark?! Freaking weird as hell.  She kept eye balling me, so I kept eye balling her back. Lol
