When I was walking in and saw a couple leaving and the man said "we have to pick a better place next time" I should have taken the hint.  I tried to order 2 different dishes and they told me they were out of the ingredients.  I then ordered the protein bowl which is supposed to contain chicken, quinoa, rice and veggies.  when it arrived at my table there were a few scoops of quinoa and a few mushrooms and the whole thing was literally drenched in balsamic vinegar. It was inedible.  I brought my plate up to the cashier and asked where the chicken and rice was and they said oh im sorry we are out. I also asked why they found it necessary to drown the quinoa with vinegar and they said oh thats how we serve it.  I politely asked for a refund and left.  I was not happy with how they handle their business and would never dine here again. I also overheard a woman in the restaurant commenting on the baked goods have absolutely no flavor.  Thankfully I found another wonderful place for brunch close by I would avoid this stinker
