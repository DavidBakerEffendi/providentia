Was never a big fan of this place but my kids enjoy it. I called today to place an order and of course was placed on hold immediately then when someone came to the phone I ordered a special #5 which was on a menu I had. Well she starts to repeat my order back to me and that's not what the menu had. She goes oh I just counted down 5 specials well that doesn't match my menu. I then read to her what my menu says. She proceeds to tell me that my menu must be very, very, very, very old cause she's been there for 4 months. My whole issue is this was obvious when she began to take my order but instead of telling me that she makes up her own thing after she promised me she can get me the number 5 special. Well guess what they longer have it so how can you make that promise. I ask to speak to someone else. I'm assuming the owner comes to the phone with her rude self. The sad part is they only treat customers that way because of where they are located. But its not a problem because my mom ordered from them every Friday for my kids but we won't be back. Rude customer service is unnecessary.
