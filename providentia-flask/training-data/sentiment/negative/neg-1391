Got bagels and coffee to go this morning and was very disappointed. For a breakfast place their coffee is awful and they don't even have real half and half out or the right cups for iced coffee. They also do not have stevia or raw sugar.. They need to get an update on this bandwagon. I'll give it to them that their bagels are fresh but our bagel sandwich was half heartily put together. It was dry and they did not get either orders right I asked for a jalape√±o bagel and got plain and I asked for pepper jack cheese and got cheddar.. Needless to say I will find a different place to get bagels and coffee.
