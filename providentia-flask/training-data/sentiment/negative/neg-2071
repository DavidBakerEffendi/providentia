Funny after my stellar last review I went back and checked this place out again.  Wow.  What complete jerks.  All I wanted was Tso's Chicken and they were total dicks when they told me they didn't have it.  They really seemed annoyed.  So I and Carlos Sr just left and ended up at IN-N-OUT in Avondale.  LOL
