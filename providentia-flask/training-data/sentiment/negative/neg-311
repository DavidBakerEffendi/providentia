Between the time of 10pm-11:30pm the evening staff are not helpful. 
One particular attendant was veey unprofessional the way she acted when a customer needed help. 
Her description is a light skinned black girl that wears a neon vest. When (I) the customer needed help she just stood there by the screen rolling her eyes making attitude faces like she don't want to be bothered. Very lazy employee need to be fired. 
A pregnant lady was walking to the atm and she didn't move to the other side to give space for the pregnant lady to get to the atm. 
Evening staffs at this Smith store are not well-trained to deal with error transactions especially when dealing with cash back. One would say cashback available to $100, then later on same employee will say no cashback we can't do it. I can't help you. 

I am not going back to this store. Very disappointing and was stressful  too. Since i accidentally left merchandise necause of the cashback commotion and even with receipt they can't help me reimbursed what i purchased or replaced it. 
There were 4 employees and no one ask the customers if they got everything with them.

Walmart employees customer service are way better than Smith's.
