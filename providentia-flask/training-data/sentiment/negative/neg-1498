this place is terrible i use to love it growing up and its gone way down hill the waitress we had was rude my grandmother asked what the sides were and she decided to announce to our table where they were and said it so loud the whole restaurant could hear here my grandmother looked mortified.  the silverware we received were dirty and the waitress looked like we inconveinced here to ask for some other ones.  Then we waited an hour for our food (for a table of 5)  and half of ours came out cold.  when we finally asked for the manager he came to our table dropped off our food didnt introduce himself or anything.  we actually had no idea he was the manager till the waitress told us.  it was my cousins birthday so my aunt asked if they did anything special they dont and she said not unless you want to order a cannoli or something.  she then brought it out after my aunt told here no and tried to use the fact shes hard of hearing as an excuse.  She then proceeded to follow us to the register afraid shed get a bad tip for the poor service.  it was terrible i will NEVER go here again.
