I'll start by noting that the food is overpriced for the taste/quality. You get a good portion (if you're ordering for 2) but it's not appetizing for Chinese food. 

The service was not helpful at all, especially given that it was my fist time at their restaurant. I went there because of the reviews but I doubt I'll go back and definitely wouldn't recommend! F!!!
