Though I've eaten dinner here at this location two years ago and breakfast at the walnut creek location in September of 2009, tonight's food was exceptionally bad. The bacon wrapped chicken was not done on the inside and mostly reddish pink, the bacon was raw and the outside of the chicken reminded me of jerky in it's texture and it's inability to actually be cut with the butterknife provided.

Though the salad was good, the main dish was abysmal and I would sooner head to Claim Jumper or Mimi's on my way into town.
