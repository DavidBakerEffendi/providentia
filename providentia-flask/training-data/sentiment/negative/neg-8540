Ordered chili rellenos.  Called in order; arrived 20 minutes later or more, so there was time for the restaurant to prepare the dish...not like a drive-through order.  It did not look like chili rellenos.  No batter on the chilis, the cheese was very watery and tasteless, and the dish resembled a mushy casserole.  The accompanying shredded lettuce has some watery substance which resembled quacamole in color.  Wondered if there are new owners or the restaurant does not staff a cook for morning hours before 11:00am.  Cost was $8.20.

Did not even recognize the chunky salsa.  Their salsa is usually exceptional for flavor.
