Worst. Service. Ever. And outrageously overpriced.

We waited 20 minutes for water that never arrived. We had to go up to the bar to order all of our food and drinks because there was no actual server in our section. (The guy we asked for water just said yes to appease us; he was a bartender.) No server in 1/3 of the restaurant for Sunday night Football??

3 bartenders working and I still stood and waited 12 minutes to order a drink. $10.50 for a house bloody mary?! It was served in a very small plastic cup (not even a red Solo cup!) and the mix came from the gun!

As I waited, I watched the bartenders screw up two orders (gave group A's food to group B and vice versa)... and then proceed to swap everything out after about 2 minutes! Unsanitary! And NO APOLOGY!

The 3 bartenders, all male, had ZERO personalities and attentiveness. One was just a downright asshole...to me, to my friends, to patrons at the bar.

I even left a long note and my phone number on my credit card slip...and no one had the balls to call me to discuss their atrocious service. They must not care.

The one star is for the band...they were decent.

Advice: skip Toby Keith's I Hate This Bar. Way too many great places to go on the Strip.
