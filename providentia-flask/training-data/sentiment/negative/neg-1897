So many issues with service.  The food was OK, but all the times I went there, they'd forget to give me things.  Knife and fork, butter, a straw for my drink.  It's always something.  How hard can that be??  I love chicken and love their chicken strips, but come on, when I order a drink, I need a straw.  When I order Mac and cheese, I need a utensil.  

No problem with the food...so if you go into the restaurant where you can get your own utensils and straws, it might be just fine, but I hate getting burned at the drive through.  Holding a cup of Mac and cheese with nothing to eat it with is very depressing.
