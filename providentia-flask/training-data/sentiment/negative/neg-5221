Comparatively cheaper than most of the other soups/noodles you can get in the Eaton Centre foodcourt.  We got a pork ramen and was surprised to find the broth in such a dark colour! The leeks seemed undercooked and too crunchy still, the broth was far too salty, and the meat was pretty much half fat.
