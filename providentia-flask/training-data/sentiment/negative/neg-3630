My mom and I arrived at about 12 on MLK Day, it wasn't too crowded but there was a 15 min. wait, no problem. We did end up waiting around during 15 minutes but they were turning  over the tables pretty quickly when  people were leaving so the wait wasn't for lack of organization. The host and hostess (who are also serves so that might explain it) weren't particular welcoming, but they were perfectly nice. There was a decent amount of seating in the waiting area. 
We were seated towards the beam of the restaurant  there seemed to be a draft near our table,  also no big deal but if you're sensitive to that sort of thing is something to be aware of. The server came over and got our drink orders. when she came back we weren't ready to order because it was our first visit. It was about 10 minutes before someone came back to get our order even though we'd seen or server around. When we did order it was not with our original server,  not sure what that was about. 
The menu had a lot of great options it was hard to choose just one, we ended up getting a blueberry pancake to share, I got the breakfast scramble (sans Monterey Jack, bacon instead of ham, and with the Hollendaise  on the side.) My mother got the Greek Fetish omelette. It took a while for the food to come out even though the majority of the people around us already had their food or were leaving.
When the food did come out the pancake was cold (actually cold), my eggs were tepid and the Hollendaise tasted strange and was broken. The omelette was OK. 
Our server finally came to check on our food about 5-10minutes after it arrived. We asked for a new pancake it was fine, the berry compote was bland and it was pretty mediocre. 
All together the meal was about 30bucks, and for mediocre (or in some cases less than mediocre) food and bad service it was not worth it. We will likely not be back, but at least the coffee was decent.
