Perfect Chinese Restaurant has been around for ages, even decades! 

It is far from Perfect but as a 24 hour business it does survive because where can you get some Chinese food in the middle of the night in Scarborough? But... for sure Perfect will not be the place for me... can I say I rather going to bed on my empty stomach? 

Prices here for dim sum is dirt cheap $1.50 for all sizes All Day weekday and weekends are $1.80. The specials are from 7 AM, great if you have to work early.. 

I don't expect much services in cheap Chinese restaurant. I can live with servers throwing things on our tables. I can stand the plastic table cover where all my plates are sliding everywhere. I can understand that the quality of food will not be as good with the price they are charging! What I cannot stand is lukewarm to room temperature dim sum! 

Shrimp Rice Roll - not only cold, the shrimps inside was like hard. 
Pan Fried Turnip Cake - cold and oily. 
Chicken Feet - lukewarm 
Siu Mai - lukewarm 
Har Gor- The only one that is tasty and hot 

Now I am more than happy to pay more at other dim sum places at least I know my food is hot and steamy.. and I can even complain to the manager if they are not up to par...

1.5 stars with 1 star goes to the fact they are open 24/7
