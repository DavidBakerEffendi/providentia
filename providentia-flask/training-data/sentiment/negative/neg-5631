After eating at Big Fat Greek restuarants numerous times prior to dining here, I thought I would give this "express" a try.  Unfortunately it could not even compare to a big fat greek restuarant and had me regretting my decision as soon as I got my food.  The atmosphere was sketchy and the food not quality.  I will not be returning to this establishment and would not reccomend it to others if you're looking for anything remotely close to BFG restaurants.
