This is my least favorite coffee shop in town. Can't go through the drive-through because the speaker microphone is been broken for over a year. The last three times I came they messed up on all of my orders. And today when I came she repeated back to me the wrong order. I think that's a sign to fix your drive-through system. And for me to never come back again. Only reason I came was because Starbucks was packed because of their unicorn frappe.
