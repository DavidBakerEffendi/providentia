Ick.  I don't think this classifies as Mexican.  I was mislead by the name but should have known better once I saw they offer wraps.  I figured they used the name wraps in place of burritos since... well... Pittsburgh is really unfamiliar with Mexican food.

I ordered the classic wrap which, according to the description, is your choice of protein, beans, cheese, rice, and choice of sauce stuffed in a tortilla.  I went with the shredded beef and chipotle sauce.  What I got ... well I can see why they referred to it as a wrap and not a burrito.  The tortilla was cold (what?) and the "shredded beef" was more like beef chunks.  The iceberg lettuce was an unwelcome surprise.  Black beans.... I hate black beans.  I guess it was wrong to assume they would be pinto or refried.  The chipotle sauce wasn't spicy at all and just added a burnt flavor.

Would never come back.  I can't believe I paid $7.20 for this wrap.  

If for some odd reason you want to try this place.... they do offer vegan / vegetarian options with grilled veggies and tofu as an option for your filling.

P.S. California, I miss you.
