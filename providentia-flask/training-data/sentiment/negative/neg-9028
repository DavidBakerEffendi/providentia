Beer selection is ok. Good room for seeing bands - sound was great. However, majority of the male staff here is unapologetically rude & disrespectful. Aging sports neanderthals that could care less that you're there.  

Don't waste your time - spend your money at Mickey's Tavern or Crystal Corner instead.
