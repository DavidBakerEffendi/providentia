BAHAHAHAHAHAH!  I cant believe someone named this part of Cleveland, "Hingetown".   Just cuz some white suburbanites move here, go to a few city planning meetings, put up a sweat yoga studio and a bunch of new bars with one word titles doesnt make this a new neighborhood.   I wanna see you tell Mrs. Jenkins up the block that her neighborhood is now called "Hingetown".  You sound like a twat...stop it.  What next?  The area on Hough between E. 71 and E. 79 is gonna be called "Puddinville".  Yeah, lets do Puddinville...I like puddin...
