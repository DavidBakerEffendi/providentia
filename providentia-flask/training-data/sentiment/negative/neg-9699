Ordered the steamed chicken and fried rice in hot pot.  Unfortunately the dish had a ton of rice but only 7 small pieces of chicken.  The fried rice only had pieces of taro and nothing else.  Very plain and cheap on anything savory.  When we spoke to the waiteress, she said that it's supposed to be like that because they only serve it with a quarter chicken.  However, it doesn't say only 1/4 chicken on the menu and it definitely looks like more chicken in the photo.  Definitely not worth its 12$ price.
