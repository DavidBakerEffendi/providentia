I was extremely disappointed.  I chose this place because I'm a seafood lover, but there aren't that many choices to choose from.  

The raw oysters were grossly looking, as you see the staff pouring out all the oysters at once instead of putting them nicely with the oysters facing up, so you would see some oysters touching the outer shells.  I tried three of them and I'm actually surprised that I didn't get a tummy ache.  

The loster tails were insanely small, which made them look like some giant insects.  

Crab legs were not that fresh either, with the meat sticking to the shells, and some were tasteless while some were too salty.

All in all, please stay away from this place, it's very costly and the quality of the food does not justify the cost.  It is the worst buffet I've ever had in my life.
