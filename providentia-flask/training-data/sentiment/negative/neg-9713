Grocery store sushi tastes better than this place.

Service - was speedy but I came in at 3pm on a Thursday. 
Food - I ordered spicy salmon and spicy crab roll. It was very bland and no spice. 
One of My crab rolls had some sort of crunchy shell inside it 

Much better sushi places around - try Sushi Xtra on Queen
