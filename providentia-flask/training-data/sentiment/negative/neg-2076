This was our second and last visit to Sonoma Grille. Service was friendly and attentive, but food was sub-par. Our last visit we felt the food had mixed reviews. Some things were good, some were just OK. This visit, almost everything we ordered was below standards for the price. Duck and appys were decent, but nothing to rave about. The venison dish was just awful! The pate was not good at all and the toast points were burnt! (Seriously?) The root veggies were NOT seasoned and under cooked! (Seriously?) The small serving of trout was just mediocre as it sat on a MOUNTAIN of mashed potatoes. The other trout dish came with undercooked rice. It could hardly be chewed. No sense in sending things back because we had to go to the show and were running out of time as it was. On top of the overpriced offerings, they have the nerve to charge you and extra charge for shot sized sauces the accompany your meals. (Seriously?!) Well, the only thing we 
are seriously sure about is that we will not be back to Somona Grille again. There are too many other better options in town for that to happen again.
