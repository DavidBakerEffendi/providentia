If it wasn't for their amazing sandwhiches I would be really inclined to leave them a big fat zero for their HORRIBLE customer service. 

The service was bad from the minite we walked in. From the guy yelling (to the back) "2 customers up front" instead of a polite "hello, welcome to capriottis someone will be with you soon" (since he clearly didn't want to get up and help us) to the SUPER snotty girl behind the counter who looked at us like we were stupid when we asked for a cup for water. She replied with "oh we don't have anymore". Worst part she didn't offer any other solution or apology, she just said we are out PERIOD, gave us the "your dumb" look and giggled as we turned to the fridge with drinks since we had to now purchase a water bottle now since they were not able to ensure they had sufficient supplies to meet the needs of their customers. 

Seriously one of the WORST experiences I have ever had. I understand restaurants run out of items at no fault of their own but the need to laugh and be rude is unacceptable. Definitely won't mind driving 10 min to the next Cappriottis to enjoy their great sandwiches minus the HORRIBLE service.
