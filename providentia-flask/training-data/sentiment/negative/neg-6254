Alright so we (group of 6) were planning to visit this little mom n pop place. Family suggested this place and they heard that the food was good. Note that this was Mothers day. 

We walked in and the 4 of us who had arrived were seated. However since we were waiting for two others we knew we should move tables so that we were not obstructing the doorway. 

No problemo. After seating we were promptly handed menus and we asked for some waters. 

15 minutes later our non-obstructive table was cleared up and our group was moved and seated. We placed our orders and waited. At this point we had no waters yet..

We waited a good 45 minutes for our food. Nothing. No waters. We asked for waters again at the end. The lady responded and went back into the kitchen. We saw her run outside texting instead of getting our waters. That was the last straw.

We walked out. I'm sure the food is great and all but this is ridiculous. Don't know why there was only one waitress on a Mothers' day. 

The two other groups of people that we saw in the restaurant looked very upset as well. At least they got some sort of sustenance!

Prices looked reasonable but I wouldn't pay for air.
