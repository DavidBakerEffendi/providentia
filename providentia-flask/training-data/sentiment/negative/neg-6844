They have Duff Beer, and it's very cheap. Quite appropriately, it tastes like water and urine. The food is some of the worst I have ever had. Fries were a floppy unseasoned pile of grease. My buffalo chicken sandwich was doused in so much buffalo sauce that I could not taste anything else. The chicken's consistency resembled wood, and the lettuce was more limp than wet pantyhose. I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food. I took two bites of my sandwich and had them throw the rest out.
