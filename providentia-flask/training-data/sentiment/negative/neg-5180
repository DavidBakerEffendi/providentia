Worst customer service ever and I will never go back to support this establishment.

I ordered a small pizza calzone today online with pepperoni and extra cheese.  I go into pick it up on my lunch break and they are busy.  It took me 15 minutes to even get my order.  I take it back to my office to enjoy the last couple minutes of my lunch, only to find that they gave me the wrong food. They gave me a steak calzone.

Mistakes happen and I understand that.  I call them and ask for a refund.  They tell me I need to drive it back there and they can give me a refund.

So again, I have to drive back there and I have no time to get it fixed since my lunch break is already gone.  

When I asked to speak to the owner about the customer service and not being willing to fix their mistake by giving me a discount next time since I was inconvenienced today, he refused to come out and even speak with me.

Mistakes happen and I can handle mistake, but rude customer service I can not.  If you don't respect the people who are paying you to stay open, I will just take my money elsewhere.
