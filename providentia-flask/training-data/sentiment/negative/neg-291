Their pad thai is made with no flavor but oil, it came clumped together and I could lift the whole pile of noodles with one chopstick. i only come back here for their spicy corn and vegetables sour soup you get for free when ordering an entree (YUM) but even that has gone downhill (really salty) last time I went. Not worth the price especially since thai has opened in the food court for the same caliber of food but at a fraction of the cost.

My mom likes this place only for their lettuce wraps and mango salad :s
