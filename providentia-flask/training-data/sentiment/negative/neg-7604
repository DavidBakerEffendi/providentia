Stopped here with a friend recently, and was extremely disappointed based on some of the reviews singing the praises of That BBQ Joint.  Ordered both the ribs and pulled pork, and wouldn't ever order either again.  

The pork was flavorless, and while pork shoulder will never match up with something like brisket for flavor, past experience has shown me that pulled pork can be quite tasty in its own right.  Even the pieces that had a bit of bark on them lacked any sort of real flavor.

The ribs, meanwhile, were barely edible.  There was no trace of a smoke ring or bark on them at all.  Instead, they were chewy, clung to the bone with awful resolve, and didn't have any flavor either.

All in all, the meal was a big let down, especially after the positive reviews from others.  For now, at least, Smoky John's remains the lone bastion of good BBQ in the Madison area.
