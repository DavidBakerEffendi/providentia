I feel badly giving this place such a bad review (as it is clearly a family-run establishment) but honestly this is one of the worst sushi experiences I've had in awhile.  My boyfriend ordered a roll that had yellowtail in it and I tried a piece and it was clearly bad.  My yellowtail and scallion roll came later and it similarly tasted bad.  When I told the waiter he said he would bring out another roll with just opened fish but that was just as bad.  I would have preferred them to have just replaced it with another roll or credited us.    Even after telling him the new roll was bad they still charged us for the roll.  I also ordered the BR7...BAD IDEA.  This is allegedly Ben Roethlisberger's favorite roll (it's a crab nigiri roll).  Honestly I had one bite and couldn't eat any more of it.  Also, the sushi rice was exceptionally cold and hard.  The house salad was the poorest excuse I've seen for a salad...there was only iceberg lettuce (usually sushi restaurant house salads have some carrots and radishes in them) and it was lettuce from the very interior of the head, very white and even more tasteless than normal.  The dressing also had no "meat" to it like the normal ginger dressings from sushi restaurants.  I think this is another classic example of a sushi restaurant run by non-Japanese people who don't really know what they're doing.
