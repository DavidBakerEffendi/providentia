I rushed home just now so I can talk about our experience here. I

We used our Groupon and was charged 18% gratuity and then was taxed on the gratuity just because had a Groupon! I have NEVER heard of that before on a 2 party dinner - 18% and then tax on it? It's SO shady. There are signs posted every where that you must forfeit your coupon before you order. We knew there was going to be a surprise at the end.

Initially we paid the $15 for the $30 dinner with Groupon. We ended up paying $20 extra for this dinner because the waiter said our 2 entrees did not meet the Groupon Amt $30. So we ordered a desert. 

Then the surprise! The check...

Get this:

Meal 1: 15.95
Meal 2: 11.95
Flan Dessert: 4.95
Beer: 4.95 Not included per Groupon, boo to Groupon!

Tax: 3.06
Gratuity 18% for 2 people: 6.80
Gratuity Tax55

Food: Meh, I've had better. It may be a different flavor in Vegas, but if you're from a real met city, this is 'meh' at best....honestly.

If you're the owner, do talk to us about this. Groupon is suppose to be a marketing tool but you just ruined yourself - you're soooo sneaky, are ya?
