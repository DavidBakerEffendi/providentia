I went for lunch and had the yellowtail. It was nice and fresh. Also had the spicy tuna roll and it was great. The spicy mayo was not good, so I wiped it off.

I came back for dinner and sat at the sushi bar. After 20 minutes, was told someone would come by, which never happened. They said people called in and the managers insisted on scheduling a manager's meeting at that time, so no one to help. Really just wanted a quick roll. I am giving a one star as dinner service was non-existent and they executed poorly.
