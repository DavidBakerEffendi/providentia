This place sucks they have a given me the wrong order five times and every time they act like it's my responsibility that I should be the one to know if I'm getting the right order or not and this last time they did not refund my money so I have to write a bad review. The man at the counter said that when they handed me my stupid bagel that he said egg sandwich, when he didn't he had said you're waiting for an order to go?  I said yes. I had checked with my mom because he was the one who had handed it to her and and when I check back with her,  she said the man had said you're waiting for an order to go? When I came back he was disputing that whole thing with me and I just said you know who's order is who's,  this is your restaurant you should know this and he just said I'm sorry what kind of a nasty attitude red hair tall gentleman I don't even care what his name it was I'm just never going back, too much if a hassle.
