I ordered a natural burger with NO cheese and NO bacon and fries at the drive-thru . when I paid I ask her again for no cheese or bacon , and then again when I got the food at the window . JUST to drive back home open the bag and see CHEESE in my burger !!  
I ask 3 times ..  no cheese ... why is it so difficult?    
I don't know if they did it on purpose or they just stupid... 
I didn't even go back there the same night just threw the food to the trash .
