I probably should have written this a year ago when we tried out this restaurant. I ordered their beer battered fish and chips; the menu said they were the best. I never got the fish and chips. The waitress instead delivered a fish sandwich on a large hogie (?) bun. I was starving and started on the sandwich. I happened to look over at the table across from us and noticed a dude with a nice plate of fish and chips. Then it dawned on me, I remembered that guy ordering a fish sandwich. I had his sandwich and he had my fish and chips. I felt pretty dumb for not remembering what I had ordered, but also pretty agravated that the waitress had screwed things up. 

The place was packed and noisey, no room to breath, reminded me of TGI Fridays in that respect. Basically just another cookie-cutter chain. They had their chance and blew it.

Yeah, I should have pointed out the mistake. I should have been more attentive.
