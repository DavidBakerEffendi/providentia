Let's start with the housekeeping isn't the greatest.  My waitress then punched in my order wrong.  Finally got that corrected.  
They only carry the pink sweetener.  
When my new wings come out one is the wrong dry rub.  I've been waiting for about 10 minutes now.  
We had to ask three times for napkins. 
My coworker and I ordered carrots and celery.  Had to ask for those 4 times.  When the manager dropped them off he just put them on the table and walked away.  
My waitress just came to my table and asked if I wanted the bill.  No.  I want my freaking wings.  
This place is a disaster and should be avoided at all costs.
