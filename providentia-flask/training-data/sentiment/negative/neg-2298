I've only gotten delivery from here but everything is always amazing! Reasonable pricing and huge portions. The panini sate huge and delicious. The Chicago style hot dogs and chili cheese dogs are incredible. Gyro is gigantic and yummy. I could go on and on. Love it all... Never mind apparently I was outside of their delivery area but the app was still allowing me to order and instead of speaking to me like an adult and explaining the situation they decided to send me my order with all portions cut in half. Charged me full price and I gave the driver a $12 tip as I always do. Everything was cold and they very intentionally left toppings off and literally cut my chocolate cake in half and sent it. Cool
