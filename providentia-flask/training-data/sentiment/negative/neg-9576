Just tried to have lunch here at 1140. Door hours and website hours said opens at 11am. There was someone inside standing at the counter and when I tried to get in the door was locked. The woman on the inside looked at me then hid behind the kitchen staring at me through the window! If you couldn't open or take customers when your sign said open at least acknowledge me and tell me not creepily stair at me through a window hoping I go away.  I was going to be a new customer and was excited to try out this new place.  Not only did u lose a customer but U got a bad review.
