If I could give 0 stars I would... The delivery lady left the pizza on my porch because the manager told her to. He refused to refund us the money because according to him it was the right order... Even the ticket had the right order but the pizza was incorrect. Then he threatened to call the cops because when I called back for a refunded he said I was harassing him... Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Id love to hear that 911 call..... Jerk.
