I understand the idea that cleaning up before the store closes helps get employees out faster. But tonight I showed up 30 minutes before closing just to be told that any menu item that cooks in the frying pan was all "sold out", and if I wanted something that was grilled they could probably make it but would have to reheat their grill and it would take a while. Needless to say I did not walk out the door with any food, and neither did the group coming in after us. Total thumbs down to this location.
