I've never given a review based on service before...but after being yelled at by the staff here on multiple occasions, I need to voice out. I usually come here with friends because of the favourable location, but we've been...
-chased after to tip more
-told to be quiet rudely by the owner
-yelled at to order faster
-been pushed aside while we were lining up

While I don't expect 5 star service, I think it's common courtesy to use an indoor voice when speaking to customers and exercise basic manners.
