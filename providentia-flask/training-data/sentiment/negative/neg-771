I moved to Phoenix almost a year ago and have heard since I moved here about the great Chino Bandido. I was really excited to try it and after much anticipation went there tonight. I arrived at 8 pm with some friends and thought it was weird that all of the chairs were flipped up on the tables except for a few vacant tables and it was still an hour til closing time. 

I ordered my food and got it quickly (there were only a few other people there) and noticed my beans were cold and somehow burnt at the same time. The rest of my food was okay but definitely fell short of expectations. 

However none of that compared to what happened next. At around 8:15, two of the young employees started mopping the whole place starting right at the drink machine. I had never in my life seen such obvious disregard for customers. Once again, there was still 45 minutes left until closing time.  When one customer tried to get to the drink machine they did not move or even apologize for mopping. 

I also noticed that there was no wet surface sign. So not only was the mopping incredibly rude but also incredibly unsafe. When I asked one of the employees mopping if she had a wet surface sign to put out, she apologized and thanked me for reminding her while saying someone else usually does it. After I explained why the situation was unsafe and our conversation ended I assumed she would get a sign but instead went right back to mopping and later stood around talking to other employees. 

I certainly can't blame a couple of 16 year olds who are probably working their first job, but I can blame management which were no where to be found. I would normally not post a negative review but this was single handedly the worst restaurant experience of my life. I will not be returning.
