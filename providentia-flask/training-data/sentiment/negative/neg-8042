Stopped in here for lunch one day and were very disappointed that their lunch "specials" included only two menu items with no options. The menu stated that for #26 we could order one taco and one enchilada, and even though the special was #26, we could not order the enchilada, we had to get two tacos.  There were no drink specials over the lunch hour, and the salsa that came with the chips had to have been cold Ragu marinara sauce. The service was incredibly slow even though we were the only ones in there. After we found out we couldn't order the "special" as listed in the menu we just paid for our sodas and left. Do not recommend at all. We will be making the drive to Boulder City to Tito's for the only good Mexican we've had since moving to the Vegas valley.
