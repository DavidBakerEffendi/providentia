It's probably my fault for not ordering fajitas from a place called juan's flaming fajitas, but they had an extensive menu and I wasn't feeling fajitas this day. I got the shrimp ceviche appetizer. Big mistake... it was not good. It lacked flavor, and barely had any bits of shrimp but plenty of cucumber. The waitress brought my boyfriend his beer but told me they needed to change the keg for mine. That is fine but she forgot and I had to remind her twice. My boyfriend and I shared the gringo tacos. I didn't know "gringo" meant flavorless ground beef with lettuce and cheese. Overall not a good experience. I felt very deceived by the overwhelming amount of good reviews on this place. Will not be returning.
