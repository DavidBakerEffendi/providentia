Large soda is now more than $1.00, although other locations any size is still only $1.00. They have styrofoam cups and the lids don't fit correctly so the first sip you end up wearing it. Every. Damn. Time! Drive thru is very slow; don't stop if you are in a hurry or have someplace to go. Otherwise, it's your typical fast food joint. Meh-I've had much better!
