Went there last night with a group of friends, the atmosphere was nice..BUT WE ALL GOT FOOD POISONING ALL 6 OF US! It had to be THE SALSA, because WE ALL GOT SICK! This place has a serious bacteria problem! I will never go there again & you shouldn't either unless you would like to spend your night puking & shitting your brains out, then go for it!
