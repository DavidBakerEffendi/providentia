From the perspective of a perennial conference attendee who dabbles in some gambling but is here because she has to be and is intending on enjoying a pampered mini-vacation:

The good: The entry-level room was a hulking 600 + sq. feet. There were nice electronically controlled shades, the recessed living room was kind of cool, and the marble counter-top lighting was pretty.  The bathroom could have used a jetted tub, but it was huge and nicely appointed.  Also, they gave out nice coupons for slot credit if you have their Club Grazie card, and I managed to turn my coupon into a modest profit.

EVERYTHING ELSE SUCKED.
Their service is the stuff of nightmares.  I booked three nights using Egencia, a division of Expedia that our firm uses to book all our corporate travel.  The Venetian erroneously believed I had booked only two nights.  When I called Egencia and had them fax the Venetian people a receipt clearly stating I had booked and PREPAID for THREE nights, they still didn't get the message.  I talked to at least three departments: the front desk, the reservations manager, and a group reservations department, who all seemed mystified.  If they would talk to each other or check their fax machines once in a while, maybe they wouldn't be so confused.  But after two phone calls at the hotel, one very frustrating conversation at the front desk, and yet one more phone call from home, I'm still waiting for them to do "research."  They promised to call me back, but after their embarrassing show of incompetence the first oh, four or five times that I explained this problem to them, I'm sort of doubtful, and I'm getting ready to just dispute the charge straight through my Chase credit card.  

Especially noteworthy:
-The front desk agents had AWFUL attitude and were condescending and impatient. They made it seem like MY fault that this problem had occurred, and were insistent that it was MY mistake.  They treated me like I didn't know what I was talking about and was there just to make trouble, even though I have already wasted hours of my life that I will never get back trying to resolve this.

- No one there seemed to know what Egencia was. Hello? Egencia is a fairly common place corporate booking service.  I've used them for a while and they are quite on the top of their game.  I am convinced that the problem is on the Venetian's end, not Egencia's end. If the Venetian wants their bread and butter, which is conventioneers, to still appear on their doorsteps every now and then, they better get it together!

- My colleague who was also there for a conference also got charged an extra night.   So clearly, they've got some sort of data input problem going on.

- What's up with the pervasive Febreeze smell that's overwhelming the air everywhere? I smell it immediately when I enter and am reminded of a public toilet. Not good for the classy image they're trying to sell.

- Finally, for the love of God, they need to play something other than sound clips from their Phantom of the Opera show in the elevator.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this musical, having seen it both in New York and in Cleveland, but if I have to hear their mediocre rendition of "Music of the Night" one more time, I'm going to lose it.

Bottom line: stay away! There are plenty of other similarly priced and better run options on the strip, and if you want a truly relaxing experience, try something off strip that's non-gaming, like the Trump or the Platinum.  At least there, you won't be run over by all the inebriated  slot machine zombies or be forced to inhale days-old second hand smoke.
