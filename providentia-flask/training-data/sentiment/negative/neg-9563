When someone orders a veggie sub you may want to consider that they don't want meat. Placing my formerly vegetarian sub directly in between two roast beef subs, in total contact with meat on both sides is disgusting and rude. Which is why I walked out. Jersey mikes has been permanently ruined in my mind.
