Oh boy... we came in here because my father in law wanted to have a brat in Wisconsin. State Street Brats is certainly a college drinking bar, and not the best place for a gluten free patron to visit. Was able to order a cider, but when I ordered a salad without croutons it came with croutons. The salad looked fine, but I didn't want to take the risk to pick around the crumbly croutons.

Others in our party said that the brats were fine, but no where close to the best that they'd ever had. Maybe stop in for a drink?
