My family and I go to breakfast every Sunday this Sunday we decided to try the cracked egg on rainbow and sunset very big mistake we all order drinks everything came but they forgot a coffee no big deal the waiter said he will be right back with a Nother cup 20 minutes later I had to go track him down to say hey we are still waiting on the coffee To top it off the food came out wrong when I asked for a manager the guy  walked out from the kitchen I told him I don't want anything for free I just want to bring this to your attention and began to explain he looked at me as if I was stupid said sorry and walked away like that's crazy first and last time we ever go there
