I cannot believe the horrible customer service of this place. They are so rude, they will argue with you even if they are wrong and you have proof of it. I ordered on the phone, I asked them if they can repeat the order, they repeated the order back to me and it was good. Then when they brought me the food it was something completely different. I told them that, that was not what I order and the guy responded that's what you ordered, and that he was only the driver and couldn't do anything about. We called the restaurant the she basically told us to not order from them again. All because they didn't deliver the right food to us. I have never seen customer service so poor!!! I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone! Customer service is so important.
