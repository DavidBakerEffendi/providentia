So now the director of operations emails me to email her about my review. My point was this less than mediocre rating bake shoppe has zero personal attention when it comes  to the customer and she proved it. Just read her response to the review and the snapshot of her response to me. Lol! It's ok director! My daughters birthday cake was ordered and discussed personally with someone right on the bake shoppe premises that I went to.The bake shoppe is Showboy in Anthem and they earned my business the right way. Personal service is the way to earn business when it comes to this industry. The reason why your place is dead all the time is because ether incompetent people working there and just quite possibly your lack of caring. I am in constant contact with media and people who can give you plenty of business, FYI I will never ever recommend this place ever. You'll be closed soon...
