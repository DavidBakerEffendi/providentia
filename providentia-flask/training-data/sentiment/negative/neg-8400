I never thought I would say  this about this place but I have to be honest. This place was TERRIBLE when we went there to eat. 
Yes, I know its a "bar" atmosphere, but I had eaten there before with my family and it had been a good experience in all manners ( both food and service). 

But recently an experience that I had was horrible in both manners. First of all , the food was HORRIBLE. The order had 2 different things wrong with it and besides that , the taste was NOT fresh at all. The tacos werent good at all. 

Then , the person I was with had ordered a beer , which was on happy hour and when the server ( which was horrible too ) , came back asked if he wanted another beer, he said yes and she didnt bother to tell us that it was going to be regular price which was more than double the price of happy hour cause we missed it by a "few minutes. So the happy hour beer was 2.00 and the regular priced same beer ws 4.50.!!!!!!!!!! 
When I asked the server about the change she was just irritated with me that i questioned her.
The entire thing was TERRIBLE.. the server was too busy talking to other staff and ignoring our table and they werent that busy in the restaurant, so its not like it was a challenge. Overall I would rate this as horrible and I will NEVER go here again..EVER
