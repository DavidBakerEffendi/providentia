Food is average and the portions are really bad. I wouldn't recommend this place.

My friends and I were embarrassed by the portions. I can't imagine the servers must be very proud of their restaurant due to the presentation of the food. It was so pitiful. 

My buddy ordered a burger and they literally brought it on a gigantic plate with nothing else on it. And my steak, shrimp, and vegetables did not come with vegetables. I guess ordering the salad cancels out the veggies. Also on the menu the shrimp is supposed to be on a bed of rice. What I got was a table spoon of rice. 

Maybe the cook was having a bad day. Either way it's no excuse. Don't go here. Eat at Panda Express. It costs less than half and you get more food too.

I bet they only give you peanuts and biscuits to fill you up so that you don't care about the embarrassing portions however I was still hungry and ate more peanuts after the meal was done.
