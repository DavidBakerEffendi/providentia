Can I give zero stars?? Literally the worst service. Waited behind two cars at the drive thru for ten minutes just assuming that the people ordering were slow but the we saw the cars angrily drive off. So we pulled up to the window and the lady started at us and we waited for a bit longer. Then we asked if they were open and she said yes I said well we waited for over ten minutes at the drive thru and nothing. I proceeded
To tell her that I thought the speaker was broken and she just ignored me and walked away. Then I believe to be the manager was complaining or and best part there was beeping the entire time we were at the window and the manager came over and put on her headset and said now I have to go deal with this. If you hate your job find another one way to lose business. Upper management wondering why you have money loss look at your employees.
