1st time here and I accidentally requested a table for 3 to someone that looked like a manager.  He quickly, and curtly corrected me and told me I needed to order at the counter.  He then proceeded to ask me if I wanted a menu, and handed me a very well used menu that was even more bent than I was at this point. I apologized, and said oh sorry, it's our first time here.  His response? Yeah, you order at the counter, any questions?  Needless to say, food was ok -not worth the $10, however thank God they explain their giving campaign online or I would've had no clue how they truly give back.  Customer service was below average.  Especially since I gave them the chance to explain what they do...  No thanks, I will spend my money elsewhere.
