On the advice of a Vegas resident who said that this buffet is "the best buffet in Vegas", my wife and I came here for the Saturday brunch buffet.  With this being the Bellagio I expected to pay a hefty price (No less than $50 per person) for really delicious food.  However, to my surprise the price was only $37.  It was at that moment that I should have turned around and ran to one of the many Vegas  restaurants run by celebrity chefs.  But against my better judgement I proceeded to pay.  We were greeted and seated by a friendly staff, but the food was just as bad or worse than many of the chain restaurants throughout the west coast.  The food was ok and worse.  Not a single item was grand or great.  The crab (which is supposed to be the star of the show) is served cold with cocktail sauce and lemon.  That's right... no butter!  Instead of the king crab that some patrons rave about they served an anorexic Dungeness crab leg that looked like it was pulled out of murky waters of Mekong River.

Additionally, the mussels were horrible.  I took one bite and got a mouthful of gravel.  I guess the cooks at the Bellagio had no time to soak the with such a high demand for their mediocre fair.

Finally, the dessert was ok, and I may have been inclined to to eat more of the cheese ravioli if I hadn't lost my appetite from the mouthful of gravel that I crunched through my teeth. I might spit out enough to fill that little pothole on Flamingo.

No more buffets for me.  When you pay $70+ for a meal that tastes worse than Chili's in Barstow I think that's time to call it quits on the once glorious experience of the Vegas life.  

What happened in Vegas didn't stay in Vegas this time around. It followed me home to my ceramic sculpture with water in it.
