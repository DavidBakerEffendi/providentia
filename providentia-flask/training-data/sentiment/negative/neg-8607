This place is horrible. A friend and i ordered the wonton soup and the pad thai. The chicken had a stench and was old and rubbery. The noodles went stale within minutes. We had to leave the food and walk out, it was that horrible. The sauce bottles were smothered, empty and dirty. THe dining room was filthy with garbage on the floor, looks like its never been cleaned. Even the tray we put our food on was sticky. 

Overall: 
Disgusting
Not clean at all
Food is stale and old

Do not go here! 
Cheers
