Unbelievable. They lost my credit card. 

I stopped in for a solo lunch, sat down, and had their Pad Thai which I'd probably rate a 4 out of 10 - it's super greasy and not all that good. 

After I give the waitress my card to pay the bill she brings me a book with a receipt to sign but not my card.

I ask her where my card is and she's saying she would have brought it to me.

I'm wearing sweats without much stuff in my pocket -keys, wallet, chapstick, phone.. I hadn't moved the entire time - not to go to the restroom or anything. My wallet barely fits any cards so there's only one secured place it fits.

There is nothing under the table or in the seat. 

I emptied the contents of my wallet into the table in front of her.

Flipped the book inside out.

They spend all but a few seconds to look for it around the restaurant and suggest to me to cancel my card. 

No person acknowledged responsibility or even offered a genuine apology. Just the suggestion to cancel my card. 

Great advice.
