I wasn't impressed with the food at all.  It was below average.  I feel IHOP is the same or better.  Server didn't seem to interested in helping us or answering any questions we had.  I will not recommended this place or come back here again.  I'm surprised that the reviews are this high.  Maybe today was one of their off days.
