I am confused about all the hype. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza (which was on special for 11.99) and 20 wings. My order came out to $34.00.

Holy shit! $1.10 per wing? Are you serious? "Better be some damn good wings", I thought to myself..

Homie on the phone said my delivery would take 30-45 minutes. Ya.. No. Add an hour to that. 

Pizza and wings finally arrived, and I was fucking starving.. Honestly.. the pizza was bad. I want chewy crust, flavorful sauce, and stretchy cheese. Pizza Heaven offers none of these mandatory pizza components..

The wings were soggy on the outside, and over cooked on the inside. The meat was tough, and stringy.

What a waste of time, and money. Don't be fooled by some of the reviews on here.. What I experienced was nothing short of Pizza Hell-
