Haters gonna hate, but it was it is.

I called a little after lunch and talked to the manager.  I asked if they would have sound for the game 7 of the NHL.  He said, yes, no problem, as long as someone else hasn't asked for sound of another game first.  So, I tell my buddies to come along.

With that in mind, we get there early.  I ask about sound and the server said, sure, we've just got music playing, shouldn't be a problem.  She takes our first beer order and goes back to talk to the manager.  She comes back with our beers and being a polite person, and the game hadn't started yet, I didn't ask about the sound.  We wait and wait, still no sound in the game.  Our server comes by one more time and we order another round, she said she'd check on the sound.  We get our beers, and never see the server again.  Nor the manager.

I eventually just left cash on the table, no check ever came, no sound, absolutely ridiculous and just plain out rude.  The manager could have at least come by with a BS excuse and pretended we existed.  I could have just as easily watched the game at my house, but friends wanted to go out.  We won't ever be back.
