I wanted to try this place as I live close-by, it failed on service, food, ambience, pretty much everything. Place was not busy, we were the only 2 people in the dining room, and there were a few people on the patio. Service was non existent, just took our orders, dropped off the food, didn't ask if everything was ok, did not refill our (lukewarm) tea.

Ordered the LA Ribs, they were ok, nothing special. The accompanying rice was cold and hard, the miso soup also lukewarm and overly salty. Also ordered the lobster roll and dragon roll with salmon. Worst rolls I've ever had, rolled so loosely that they fell apart right when we lifted them off the plate. Tiny slivers of fish and just a terrible presentation.

Cleanliness is terrible, the soy sauce container was filthy, and the sauce was black for some reason, probably a combination of being dirty and refilled too many times. Also an "old" dirty smell in the dining room, with flies buzzing around everywhere. Just an absolutely horrible dining experience.
