Came back for another try after a couple of not so good visits..... it's Saturday, football is on and there are several customers but I would definitely want to be busier if I owned the place. 1 employee..... prolly a cook in the back but up front , 1 guy! 1 guy to answer the phone, take orders, handle the dining room and the people sitting outside and bartend! WTH are you people thinking? That you are saving payroll??? This place sucks ! Stay away! High prices and bad service.
