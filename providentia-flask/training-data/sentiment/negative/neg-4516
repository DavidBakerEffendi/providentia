I want to start by saying this used to be my favorite place. 
My husband found a baby Cockroach in his sushi roll last night and quickly ran to show our server/manager. They said ew and gave us 92 cent discount92?!?!? I know mistakes happen but a bug in our food!?!? SO GROSS! I'm so mad our sushi spot is now ruined for date night. The fact that we had to pay for our full meal is crazy. My husband even said regardless if there was a bug he still would have gone back if the customer service was better. They handled this situation very badly!
