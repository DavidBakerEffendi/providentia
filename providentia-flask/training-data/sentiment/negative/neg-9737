We had a reservation for 6.  On arrival they dismantled a 6 seater table and put 2 others together in an extremely cramped way next to the window which was a very cold place.  The rest of the restaurant was empty.  We asked to be moved. They refused.   Then we confirmed we needed separate bills.  They refused.   All the while they did not smile, sent a different person to our table each time and did not treat us nicely at all.  We left and went to the lobster restaurant a few doors down.  Not only did we have excellent service and food there, they told us others have come from the TRIO disgruntled as well.  They do not appreciate customers.
