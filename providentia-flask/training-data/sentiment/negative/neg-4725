After a long day I decided to order pizza. I ordered my regular which is a John's favorite pizza and an order of garlic breadsticks. As always, the breadsticks were amazing. They were hot and fresh and full of flavor. The pizza on the other had was extremely bland and the crust almost seemed like it wasn't cooked all the way. The sauce on the pizza had no flavor and sausage was either old or just not seasoned properly. I ended up eating one piece and throwing away the rest. Definitely an upsetting way to end a long day. Thankfully I had breadsticks to eat. Hopefully this was just a one time thing but makes me hesitant to order from this location again. I hope papa johns isn't trying to cut corners and buy cheaper products. If they are it definitely shows and they will begin to lose customers. Papa Johns is known for quality and consistency and this order definitely fell short. Don't change what's not broken!!
