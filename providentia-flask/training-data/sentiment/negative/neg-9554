I wish there was a 0 star option. That's how bad the food is over there. I ordered 3 Salmon rolls which totaled up to $26 (same price as an all you can eat at other places). The 3 rolls had about 14 pieces total which was almost all rice and the salmon in there was really chewy because it still had the black stuff on the bottom of it. I ate 3 pieces and was about to throw up. I would advise anyone craving sushi to get it from some where else because this place is just horrid and expensive. This is my first yelp review and I had to post this just to let people know that dynamite grill is NOT the spot.
