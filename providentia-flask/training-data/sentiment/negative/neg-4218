I went here with a couple of friends on a Friday night. The place was pretty lively, but the service SUCKED. It literally took us ten minutes to grab the attention of our server. The waitresses kept chatting in Chinese and ignoring the customers.

The bubble teas are okay at best, they screwed up some of our orders and some came out really watery. Was not the best experience for bubble tea. At all.

Won't come back for sure. I guess I'll be going back to Bubbletease in Square One.
