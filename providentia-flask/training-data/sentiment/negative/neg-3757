This pains me, but I have been left with no choice. I've been to the Happy Dog three times. My first two visits were pretty close to perfect--excellent dogs & tots, interesting beer on draft, and killer live music. However, on our most recent visit (August 3rd), we were charged 49.50 for a 24 dollar check. This might not seem like a significant amount, but it did result in an overdrafted account and the penalties associated with that. We wanted to work it out with the business quietly, and after calling and speaking to an employee, we were reassured that a manager would call back to handle the situation. The manager never returned our call, so we followed up with a private Facebook message yesterday (message was sent before the business opened for the day). Again, we were told a manager would call. Again, we haven't heard anything, and it is now apparent that we are being ignored.

More than a week after initiating contact, this situation is still playing out. Now, we are forced to pursue other avenues to recover the money, and I doubt we will ever patronize the Happy Dog again following this disappointing experience.

Edited with update: An employee finally did return the phone call, and they gave us their "word" the money will be refunded. I hope this will be the case (and will update the review if/when it happens), but this has been such a frustrating experience that I cannot in good faith amend my review further.

Edited again: The money has been fully refunded, but I still think it took far too long for this to be handled. I appreciate that the staff was eventually helpful, but the error should have never happened in the first place, nor should there have been such a long delay in getting back to us.
