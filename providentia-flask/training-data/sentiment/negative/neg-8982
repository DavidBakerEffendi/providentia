The hubby and I decided to give this place a shot. What a disappointment. The only thing that they got right was the miso soup. Yes, you read that right miso soup! I ordered a shrimp tempura roll-one of the most basic rolls you could order and it was just awful. It didn't taste fresh and was covered with tons of tempura flakes. I asked for a side of sauce and when I asked if there was eggs in it the waitress said I don't know and looked at me like I was bothering her. Then she asked if I really needed to know. I said yes it would be nice to know and she said well then don't eat it?!! I couldn't believe it. If you're going to work at restaurant you must know ingredients for dishes or at least be willing to ask the chef. People are allergic to many things and to act like we are asking for something that's nearly impossible c'mon. Anyway husband has the chicken katsu and shrimp fried rice, it wasn't authentic at all!! I would rather drive an extra 10 min to island sushi or my ultimate favorite goyemon.
