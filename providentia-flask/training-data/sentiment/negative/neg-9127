Went here for my Birthday with a big group.  We made reservations for a late lunch.  I was looking forward to this as we usually eat here 2 times a month or more and it's one of my favorites.  
Our server was too busy talking to the bartender and answering the phone to take our order and did not fill drinks unless asked.
When we paid our bill we left the tip on the table and left.  The server followed us to the door to as where her tip was and why we didn't add it in.  When we told her it was on the table she said oh I was worried and walked off.  I could not believe how RUDE.  When I spoke to the manager he just said she was scared she got jipped and he'd tell her she shouldn't follow people.   REALLY!!  That's it??  We get followed out, embarrassed and she was worried?
I will no longer be making the out of the way drive to this restaurant when this is the way they are going to treat customers who regularly frequent their establishment.  I will not recommend them anymore either after this!
