This is seriously the WORST chipotle I have ever been to and I have been coming here for years. 

There must be new management or the staff that was working on my most recent visit were just plain stingy. One of my favorite parts about ordering at Chipotle is that -duh- adding extra items onto your plate IS FREE (except for meat and guac.) So PLEASE do explain how it is that you think it is okay not to provide guests with extra ingredients when this is a standard courtesy throughout the other locations. 

Say hello to the SMALLEST and stingiest plate of food I have ever ordered. I am honestly so shocked that they had the audacity to try and charge people for that. 

While this location is nestled with Panda Express and McDonald's between Harrah's and the Venetian, you'd do much better to walk a couple blocks down to another location because this place is T R A S H.
