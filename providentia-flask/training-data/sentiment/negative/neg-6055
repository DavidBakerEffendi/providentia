It could be the worlds best Chinese, but customer service and delivery method are putrid. I placed an order an order and asked for delivery. Order of five meals for friends and myself for dinner, so it is a very profitably delivery. I call an hour and fifteen minutes after the order and they forget my order and say it will be another twenty to thirty minutes. 


I will never call back and will not be advising any of my friends or coworkers to go there either.
