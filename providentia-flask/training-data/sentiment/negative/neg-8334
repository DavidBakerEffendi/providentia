First off I want to say that I absolutely love Pita Jungle and I've been eating there for almost 10 years. This review is ONLY for this location. 

I've been coming to the Arcadia location pretty frequently over the past 6 months and I am extremely unhappy with the service. About a month ago my boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night. It was a little busy but nothing crazy. Our server took our order and then completely forgot about us. Someone else brought out our food and our server never checked on us even ONCE. I literally had to go track him down to get our check 20 minutes after we finished our meal. And the weirdest part was that he was taking care of all the tables around us... So ridiculous! 

Then we ordered take out a couple of weeks ago. We ordered a Mediterranean platter and a hummus and only got ONE pita! It sucks because we didn't realize this until we got home. Another thing is every time I call to place a take out order I'm put on hold for at least 10 minutes then when I go to pick up my food no one is even in the restaurant! 

Now what finally sent me over the edge was what happened tonight. I placed a take out order (after I sat on hold forever) for a LARGE hummus and LARGE garlic dip and what we got was ridiculous, there is barely any hummus or garlic dip in the containers. It looks like they took a small hummus and garlic dip and spread them out in a large containers (see attached photos). Then to top it off our pitas were completely cold and gross.


I am so disappointed, I've frequented many of the Pita Jungle's in Phoenix or the years and I've never experienced anything like this. We will definitely not be back to this location!
