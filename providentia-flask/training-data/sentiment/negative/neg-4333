What a sad waste of our time. We tried this place for the teppan grill experience as a family. It was bonus that we got a Groupon, so we gave it a try. 
It was Friday night, So I made reservations for 7p.

We got there at 6:50p. We walked in and stood at the door looking for a hostess. NO ONE came up to us or greeted us for first 9 minutes. We sat down on the front bench next to door/register waiting to flag down someone. The restaurant was not packed. We finally grabbed a server and said, "sorry, can we get seated to eat please!?" The girl said, "oh you do you have reservations? " I replied, "yeah for 7p". It was now 7:20p. She said okay. Another family walked in and then we got seated at 7:37p..

Finally we got seated and were grateful to finally get to eat. The restaurant was dirty. There was rice on the ground and chairs. The music was loud and ready for a rave. 

We got our orders in: two chicken teppan dinners and scallop dinner. The chef was great, seemed to know what he was ddd doing. The food was incredibly disappointing.  The soup was more cloudy and salty than usual miso soup, salad had plopped spoonful of ginger dressing on top.  Fried rice was good, although we were charged $3.00 each more. The Asian server was taking our order and was like, "you want fried rice, right?" So we replied, "yes". Lol too funny.
Well it was sad, because each person that ordered chicken ended up ALL having dry chicken. In the end I told the server, she got very upset and walked away. Then she came back a minute later and said, "I wanna try your chicken. Can I?", as she was already reaching her fork to the plate. She chewed it and walked away again. She did come back and deduct one chicken kids meal off which was nice. But overall...do not go.
