Went to this panda location to pick up supper on 2/10/17.  Had a 10 to 15 minute wait just to order. Most of the serving dishes were less than half full to empty. I order a child's meal and added a side and a panda bowl and added a side. This wasn't the first time I'd ordered food like this. When I was asked to pay, even though I was still waiting for food the the add on side for the child's meal was missing. The girl cashiering proceeded to tell me that the side I'd put with the child's meal was added to the panda bowl and if I wanted the second added side that was missed I'd pay full price since it was now on a separate ticket. The extra item should have been $1.50, but instead she told me it would be $4.31. And this after having to wait 10 to 25 minutes for food because the items ordered were depleted and the next serving wasn't ready. I'd gone on 2/3/17 and ordered the exact same food with no problem.  This was very poor customer service. Won't go back to this panda again.
