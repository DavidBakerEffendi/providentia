Oregano's used to be a reliable go-to restaurant with friendly staff and a fun atmosphere.  Unfortunately, over the last year the service has declined significantly.  We have had 4 very bad experiences in the last year at various locations.  Today's experience was negative from start to finish.  Bad, disorganized, slow, and inconsistent service ruined our celebratory graduation dinner.  We had to physically go find servers to help us with drinks, to order meals, and even to pay our bill.
