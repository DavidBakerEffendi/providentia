Unfortunately this location serves you ice cold meals. I will not be returning had I known my meal would feel like I'm biting into ice cubes when I order through the drive thru then I would have had them remake it or either that get my money back. My husband and I love Panera but the last few times we should have learned our lesson and not returned for the sake of spending $10 on the nastiness sandwich I've ever tasted. Coming from a woman who was hungry and looking forward to eating her expensive "fresh" sandwich complete let down threw it directly in the trash. It will be no surprise when this location is closed down for serving people everything but fresh food. That is all.
