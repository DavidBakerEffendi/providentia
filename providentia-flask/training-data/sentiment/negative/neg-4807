Well I am not the best person to ask about East Indian cuisine. It would not be on my list of top choices. So that being said, I will share my impressions of Tanroori Times. I have been there twice for lunch. Both times my party had the same waitress, and both times she was so slooooowwwww. The second time she accidentally charged us for 2 instead of 4 chicken lunch specials. We were honest --  pointing out the undercharge. She proceeded to totally screw up the change (pocketing the $24 cash) and then overcharging the three debit cards as if we did not supply cash as well. If I did not know better I would have said she was blonde. Sheeshh.

They desperately need some sort of new ventilation system. It smells like all the smoke from the kitchen is not venting out correctly. The AC is way too cold. Several in my party were cold. And the bathrooms were gross. The food was tasty, but I'll pass on this one next time.
