Apparently  this is  the original version of Chipotle and Zabas type eateries. 

This was my first and unless every other place like this ( Cafe Rio, Zabas, Chipotle etc) in town closes down; this will be my last visit. Ok. Let me take that back... Even if they all close down I feel comfortable saying I'm never willingly coming back. 

The place was empty so maybe the food that they prepped dried and withered while waiting on customers?

All I know is that the portions were small and flavorless.  The staff was less than enthusiastic and the place was dirty. 



Maybe the weekend staff is not up to par and  hopefully this wasn't their best day. 

Hopefully your experience is better.
