WATCH OUT FOR HAIRS IN THEIR WAFFLES... Ordered $35 worth of food (chicken and waffles, the big breakfast, kid's meal, apple juice, orange juice, and arnold palmer).  After devouring the chicken and making my way through the waffles, half way through I see a blonde hair in the waffle.  Didn't want to make a scene and told the owner of the location and she looked stunned and asked if we wanted her to make me a new batch of waffles????!  NO THANK YOU.  And she walks in the back with the waffle.  That's all.  Lost customers and yes, totally advising others to watch out for hairs in your food.
