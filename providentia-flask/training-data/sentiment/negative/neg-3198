I want to try something new since I never have Latin foods before. I ordered the pollo Saltado to go. Fries on side. No soy sauce. Fine with me as long as no salt on it. all good. About $17 for the meal. Food came out of two big food containers. Not worth it. Small portion. Not enough for the price being paid. Chicken strips is dried. I wanted something with fries so I got this plate. I didn't even get my rice that was suppose to come with the meal! I'm just disappointed. First time and the last time for me.
