I used to frequent this place on occasion because of the location and they offered semi decent food. 

However, a couple weeks ago I had one of the worse experiences of my life. I had walked in literally a minute before closing, so they were not the most friendly. However, they still had a restaurant full and if they didn't want anyone to come in, they should have locked the doors. (which they did after I walked in)

I ordered special combo Pho with extra tendon to go along with a grilled pork banh mi. The wait was short and easy. I paid for my food and was on my way home.

Me and my hunny shared the banh mi, which was half ass put together. I had a piece of cucumber which was literally 1/3 of a cucumber that was just thrown on there. And not to mention almost a whole jalapeno that was just on one side of the sandwich. Talk about lazy and no attention to detail. 

So after we finish the banh mi, I pour my broth in a pot to warm it up and get it steaming hot so my meat can warm up too. When I go to open the container up, the first thing I look at is my tendon and considering I paid almost $2.00 for extra tendon, I felt ripped off. My rare meat, not even cooked had a light brown tinge to it, which means it was not fresh. 

And then to make things worse, two little flies or gnats or whatever they were flew out of the bay leaf and bean sprout pile and completely ruined my appetite.

In utter disgust, I threw it all away and almost felt the need to vomit.

I used to like this place. But now, you will never ever catch me here, no matter how bad I got a craving for Pho or  banh mi.
