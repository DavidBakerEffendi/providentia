Went here looking forward to an awesome Filiberto's breakfast burrito and instead got something that tasted like it was from Taco Bell. The potatoes were obviously the frozen kind and the chorizo was subpar. They didn't even get the horchata right, too sweet. Won't be visiting again. 

Pro: drive-thru was pretty quick.
