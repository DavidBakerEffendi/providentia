I wouldn't know if the food was good or not. My wife and I went in on Monday night, 7-27 at about 5;00 and sat down at one of the booths. It seemed real noisy, and the bartender was yelling across the room at one of his buddies. My Wife and I sat there for over 10 minutes to order some Beer & Wings, but no one ever came over. So finally we got up and went across the street to Poppo's and had great service. We enjoyed a couple of Beers & Poppers. I have heard so many good things about Tailgaters, but if you ask me, that place SUCKS. I don't want my Wife to experience that again, so I don't think we will ever give it another try.
