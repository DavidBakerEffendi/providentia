Stopped in to purchase some spices, the owner was talking to another person in his native language, at first I thought it was a customer. But after ten minutes of him talking with the same person it was either a visiting friend or a family member. I stopped at the counter to ask for assistance finding a spice that I didn't see in the aisle. He continued his conversation in his native language and gestured in my direction but never stopped talking to the woman he was talking with since I  walked into the store. I walked down another aisle and still did not see what I needed. So I left why spend any money at this store when it's obvious my patronage is not wanted. Horrible customer service.
