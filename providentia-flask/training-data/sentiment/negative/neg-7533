If you are the type of person who buys salads from Carls Jr. because of the ads with Kim Kardashian, then this trendy candy shop is for you.

This is all style and zero substance.  If you want gummy candy for ten to twenty times the price that you'd pay compared to any 7-11 in the country, then this is your store.

They have gelato here too and I haven't tried it, but I was so put off by $20 lollipops and the expensive bulk candies that I passed on it.

If you want gummi candy, then go to 7-11.  If you want gelato, check out Jean Phillipe Patisserie in Aria or Bellagio.  If you want chocolate, then Max Brenner and Jean Phillipe are worth checking out.  There are much better options on the strip.  

This is a sweets shop that is so large that it is hard to avoid.  By all means, check it out when you're walking by Paris.  Just don't get suckered in because of the marketing and style.
