Came for dinner. Waited 45 mins for the waitress (Tessa) to take our order while she was chatting with 2 bar customers.  Bad management decision to have a waitress run between the bar and tables so not totally her fault but bad for a customer experience regardless. We decided to leave instead of ordering.  Place was mostly empty on a Saturday night so that should have been a clue.
