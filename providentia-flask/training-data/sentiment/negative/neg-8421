Second time buying a veggie wrap at this specific Subway and I am as disappointed as the first time. There is an employee that certainly thinks she is making a burrito instead of a wrap. This Subway gets one star because of that. Please train your employees so they know how to make a good sandwich the Subway way. I would NEVER go back to this location. Very upset!!! Btw I called to talk to a manager and theres only one from M-F. Woowww!! No wonder.
