Whatever you do DO NOT EAT HERE!! My husband and I ate here on 2/5/17 after the Super Bowl and we both got the worst food poisoning of our lives. We both ordered dim sum for appetizers and the Wonton Noodle for our main meal. To be fair I think it was the dim sum not the noodles that got us sick, but regardless I would advise against ever eating here. We were supposed to fly out the following day but we got so sick that we had to reschedule our flights for the next day and had to stay an additional day at the Venetian costing us over $400 total. In case you don't believe me we even filed a formal complaint with the hotel for future records. If I could give this place zero stars I would. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!! STAY AWAY!!
