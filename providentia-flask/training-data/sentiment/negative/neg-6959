First get the employees trained.  I ordered a peanut butter crunch flat bread and a blimey Limey .  Normally there is a special where you get $1.99 for the smoothie with the wrap purchase.  So I get my total and it seems low so I sign and give a tip.   Then when I get my receipt I'm only charged for the wrap.  great!  Go back to counter ask about my smoothie guy says sorry he forgot. Then can't get me the smoothie for 1.99 . So I pay full price for both and  to top it off it's the longest wait for my smoothie.  I almost just asked for a full refund and left.    Definitely need to get this corrected.  Good thing there are other places to go. I'll be avoiding this one !
