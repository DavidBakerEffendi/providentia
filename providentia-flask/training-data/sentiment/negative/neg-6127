Terrible service.  We stood there for a while waiting for someone to acknowledge us.  They see us standing there and no one even says anything because they're busy talking amongst themselves.  Every once in a while they will call people to pick up their order, but not once did anyone say "hi, hello, or we'll be right with you."
