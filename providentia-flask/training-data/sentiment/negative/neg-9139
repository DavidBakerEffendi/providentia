I was invited here to listen to a good friend sing..they have Karaoke on weekends. There was only a handful of customers that Friday night plus a very large family sitting on one side.. It's a new place. Very clean, not very good service though. My friend and I sat towards the back where the DJ was and we were never asked for refills on our drinks? Not one time....we felt like we were Ghosts? Didn't try the food because it was pretty late for dinner, (after 9pm) We actually felt so unattended, that we left pretty early. Never again. Thank God Vegas is full of great service at other places!! I do not recommend...
