We were pleased to be seated around 6pm on Cinqo de Mayo for dinner. People kept streaming in after us and it was clear they were inappropriately staffed and getting slammed.

It took 10 minutes to get our order taken and then drinks and our guacamole came over fast. The only other thing that happened fast in the close to *two hours* we were there, was them clearing and giving away our table while we were in the washroom!

We had asked our server to pack up our substantial leftovers and bring the bill while we quickly went to the washroom. We came back to a family sitting at our table - not their fault as they had been seated there.

So we stood, holding up the wall in the middle of the restaurant, while they printed up our bill and had us pay at the cash register. They offered to cook us both entire fresh meals to take home and so I said only my kid's. We then continued to hold up the wall waiting while they made it. Why they did not offer to comp an item, which would have been faster, I don't know.

As we were leaving my kid was lamenting her poor tacos all alone in the garbage. At that point we both started laughing. Ridiculous. 

We had been to the restaurant before and it was fine, but tonight was our last visit. The food was good, but irrelevant given the circumstances.
