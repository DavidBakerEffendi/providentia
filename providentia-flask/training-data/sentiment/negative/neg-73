Pretty bad.  Had been here a few years back, wow did this go downhill.  Service was horrifically slow - didn't help that she had way too many tables.  Food - bad, just plain bad.  Had some fried shrimp - how hard is that?  Over-cooked blobs of mess.  Don't waste you're time.  Go across the street to Brennan's.
