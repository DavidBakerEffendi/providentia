This review is purely on service. Sat down with my son, was not given menus. 10 min later, I stood up to get someone's attention.  They brought menu. I knew it was 10+ mins as happy hour ended at 7 pm and hostess sat us with about 13 mins to 7 p.m.  waiter never came. Never said "I will be right with you" no acknowledgement, nothing. Left 8 mins later. Not even seeing Brian or whatever or waiters name was?
