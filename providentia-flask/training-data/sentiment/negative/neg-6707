I've never received such bad service from anyone like I experienced from this store. I went in and order two smoothies plus a soda, and wraps.. The soda machine happened to be broken and instead of trying to help the me the manager and all employees were rude.. Making faces and giving attitude. I got a refund and left the store. I will not be returning to this store again.
