I waited in line forever and a woman called me up to the register very urgently like she was in a rush. I gave her my order of a chicken wrap with no tomato (I don't care for raw tomatos) and then we stand and wait as she doesn't have a cash register. Very effective. Eventually I get to pay and she tells me my number is 267. Anyway, the same lady then goes to make my wrap. I watch her across the distance making it with tomato. She calls number 276. I assume it isn't me because that's not my number and the wrap has tomato. She eventually determines it is my order. I tell her I ordered no tomato. She opens the wrap, takes off the tomato, and gives it back to me. Seriously? It's a really good thing I'm just picky and no allergic. There was still a huge amount of slimey tomato residue. I won't go back if I see her working.
