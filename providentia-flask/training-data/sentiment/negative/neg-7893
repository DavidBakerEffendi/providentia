We were wanting to try this place for a while - we entered during lunch time and we were the only ones there so the wait service was awesome.  FYI:  they will only bring you water and chips if you request it otherwise they will not bring them.  I was disappointed in the menu it was not too big and most of there items were on the spicy side which our family does not eat.  Plus we have an allergy to soy and all there items have not only Soy but Genetically modified soy is the worse stuff ever... the wait staff did try to find me something to eat without soy and they did not realize Soy is the # 1 ingredient in mayo....so could not eat anything except the chips which were really good...They do have a gluten free menu but they should have a Soy free gluten free menu as well - so I will not be returning.
