This was a terrible experience. We have been here a handful of times before, and always had something incorrect or service issues. This was ridiculous. First, the service and the food was awful. Our server clearly didn't care and she was training a new employee! Prices are high for the quantity and quality served, such as $16.95 for 3 Taco Bell size tacos that are underseasoned and underwhelming. In contrast, the fish bites were so salty, they were almost inedible. They brought me the wrong salad. I didn't realize it until the guy walked away. I thought I would try it, but the strawberry dressing they brought was disgusting. I waited almost 18 minutes before our server came to the table. I told her the salad was wrong and the dressing was awful. She said it was wrong and would have them make another one. I told her I did not want to wait and everyone else was well into their meals. She said OK and left. Someone brought me different dressing, but I did NOT like that salad. When she brought the check, we were still charged for the $16.95 salad that she even pointed out I didn't eat. I am SO SICK of having to beg for a manager when there is an issue that the server is CLEARLY aware of. This time, we paid the bill and left. We will write reviews and tell everyone we know about our rotten experiences at this restaurant instead.
