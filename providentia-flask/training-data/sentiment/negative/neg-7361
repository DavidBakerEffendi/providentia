I went into The Thumb last week with my family, really looking forward to the delicious bbq they are widely known for. However, upon getting our drinks at the fountain, my sister seemed to be in the way of one of the Thumb employees with dark brown hair, glasses and a very professional looking nose ring. The worker was carrying an ice tray commented under her breath "Move, Brat," in a tone obviously loud enough given a fellow employee standing next to her felt the need to call her out and tell her she shouldn't talk to costumers like such. I was gravely disappointed given she did not even proceed to saying or showing the slightest bit of apology. Instead, the girl scoffed to her coworker and replied "Whatever." We have always been pleased with the food and the ambiance of The Thumb, and it is very sad to think that we will not be visiting there again for awhile now. "Thumbs" up on costumer service.
