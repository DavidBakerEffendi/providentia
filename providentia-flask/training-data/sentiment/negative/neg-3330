In response to the owner of this formerly wonderful restaurant, you sir have an interesting way of skirting the truth.  By virtue of the way you responded to my nephew ( Sean F. - 5/7/16), yes it was my birthday, you sound like a guilty man.  If it was the case that larger parties are usually concluded after 2.0 hours, don't you think it would have been helpful to let my husband know that information when we made the reservation?  As far as leaving the table to watch the derby, my husband DID tell the young lady when he made the reservation that watching the derby every year is one of our family traditions.  She told my husband that it wouldn't be a problem. It seems like both of those situations could be solved with a little better training.Oh yeah, I wonder who should be doing that? 

The final straw was your contemptible response to me when I asked if you cared that you were ruining my 60th birthday.  You said, " I DON'T CARE, IT'S MY 70TH & I'M MAKING MONEY."  So anyone in Yelpland looking to celebrate a special occasion with special people in your life, don't go to Hoffstots in Oakmont. This guy will kick your family out as he did ours. It doesn't matter how much money you spend, this owner wants more. That goes for you, all potential golf professionals & staff from the U.S Open---don't plan a leisurely meal at Hoffstots, the owner will kick you out & won't care how important the day was for you.
