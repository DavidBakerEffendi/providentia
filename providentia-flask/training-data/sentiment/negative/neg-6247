Went today for Mothers Day with reservations no issues being seated on time no issues with food but thats where it all ends. I have never encountered such bad service in my entire life! We were rushed out of our table to make room for another reservation. If we had been told a time limit when making the reservation it would have been conpletely fine! The owner of the restaurant tried to brush this situation off with some desert but frankly we declined as we had all lost any remaining appetite!
Thanks  but I will never go back!
