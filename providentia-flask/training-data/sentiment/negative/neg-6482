Some of the worse service I've ever gotten. We got food that we didn't order and when we asked what it was our server said it very quietly and when asked to repeat she gave us a very dirty look and walked way. For the rest of our time there she did not acknowledge our existence and walked away from us when we asked for anything, even though we weren't a large group ( just me and my sister). Also the food is mediocre.
