First time there we walk in and are advised by a passing waitress to sit anywhere. No smiling face no welcome to fiber Magees. We grab a table and a waiter stops by hands us menus tells us the special  and we order the all you can eat fish. Tells us we have to order  two drinks in order to get it. Water doesn't suffice.  I'm not much for soda and juice has too much sugar and I don't drink... So the hubby gets a shot. Which ends up being $7!  Our fish and fries come and the fries are soggy and swimming in oil and the fish batter,although tasty in beer batter, is thick and uncooked. It was still doughy inside... I ask the waiter for melted butter but apparently this isn't something you can get as it only comes in sticks... Because melting butter isn't a thing here.. No apologies from the waiter... Never checked of we liked our food or if we wanted anything else.., when he stopped back we asked for the check. He brought it with no questions slapped it on the table and walked away... No thank you for coming to fibbers... Needless to say.... We will not be going back.... Cost is too high service is bad  food was not impressive at all.
