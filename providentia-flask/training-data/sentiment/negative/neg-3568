Just don't go. That would be my only recommendation. Nothing about this restaurant is appealing. The men's bathroom was disgusting. The toilet was full with someone's bowel movement.

One of the TV's was playing StreetzTV, which evidently plays hardcore rap videos that show gratuitous twerking. Not exactly a family friendly atmosphere. 

The food was terrible. Steak every single cut was awful. The only thing that was good was the garlic bread. Even the iced tea tasted awful.
