The delivery service that they advertise thru postdates is a joke and a ripoff.  Twice we have ordered home delivery and both times they have failed to include dishes that we ordered and paid for. How a restaurant this inept can stay in business is beyond me. The food was also mediocre at best, but at least we expect to get what we paid for.  When we call to complain about the incomplete orders, their is a lack of enthusiasm and concern about correcting the incompetence involved.    Perhaps the owner should have stayed in the pharmaceutical business, since he obviously cannot run a restaurant enterprise. How hard is it to package what people order online and deliver it????
