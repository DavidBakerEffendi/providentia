Horrible! Went to breakfast with my fianc√© literally an hour after opening. Toast was soggy, eggs under cooked, some thing's were sour or old, hard boiled eggs where like rubber, their "free" mimosa tasted stale (not sure how that's possible but they managed to do it!)  paid $60 for two people and everything was inedible!
