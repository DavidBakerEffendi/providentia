Today was the first time I had ever gone into this location. The staff is nice but unfortunately, my image of this location is terribly tainted. I took my order to go. When I sat down to eat my veggie burrito bowl, I found a large dead moth in the lettuce. Discussing! Since I was super hungry and really didn't feel like diving back, I decided to just toss out the chunk of food surrounding the dead moth, and tried not to think about it as I tried to enjoy the food. As I took my second bite, I noticed a dead fruit fly in the lettuce. It was at this point that I couldn't take it anymore, so I drove back and got a refund. Never coming back to this location, ever! The manager handled the situation well, but these are just one of those things that a restaurant can't take back.
