2pm and waited in the drive though for almost 30 minuted with only 1 person ahead of me. Service is far below standard, perhaps you need more employees. You are losing so many customers. Also, the person with me asked for extra bacon on her sandwich and their reply was "we can't afford to give extra bacon today!" For real?
