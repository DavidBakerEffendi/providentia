Wasn't too impressed. 

The waiter we had was extremely awkward and made the experience feel awkward and kind of uncomfortable. I don't think they were comfortable in that role. 

The food...too over priced for what you get. I ordered Fattoush Salad with chicken. The salad was eh - not that good - had the dressing but almost just tasted like a garden salad; the ingredients weren't soaked in the dressing so it didn't taste like a regular Fattoush to me, and I only got 4 tiny pieces of chicken on the salad. Those 4 pieces of chicken cost $6.99 to add to the $7.99 salad (pictures included in my review). 

By the time you order 2 main entrees, your better off getting a platter - way better deal. Don't think the platter should be cheaper than 2 meals considering the platters come with a lot more food. Not priced correctly. 

Service: awkward 
Food: nothing amazing and Fattoush was really lacking in flavour. 
Price: expensive for what you get. 

Personally, I wouldn't go there again. Wish I read the reviews below before I decided to go.
