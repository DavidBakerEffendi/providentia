Ya, no.

Horrible experience.  Wings were tiny, like if Derek Zoolander were there he'd have questions.
Sauce was decent, but they rated it 4 out of 5 for heat... I'd have rated it a 2 max.
Only one server who was doubling as bartender.  Slooooooowwww service.  I'll give her a break because she was alone, but come on.  The place was not that busy and apparently had lots of time to talk to fanclub/boyfriend at the bar.

There are much better options, won't be back.
