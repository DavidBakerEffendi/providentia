I never post bad reviews unless it's my first visit to a business and the service is EXTREMELY terrible. So this is a perfect example, my husband and I have driven by here for the last year and keep wanting to try it. Well we did and will not be back due to the TERRIBLE employee they have taking orders. I order the #19 which is a chicken plate and she asks "what dressing?" I ask what they have and her response with an attitude she lists them extremely fast so I ask her again if she can repeat it and she does in a manner as if she was talking to a person who is challenged. Then my husband orders " chicken plate" and my son "beef plate We receive the orders beef plate, chicken plate a few minutes later brings my plate which was a shrimp plate. I take it back up and let her know I order a #19 which is also a chicken plate. She then tosses it on the back counter and grabs a chicken skewers and literally throws it on the grill. So obviously our business was not needed her so I ask for a refund and her response was " I don't know how to do that on this new system  I then let her know we'll take it in cash back then. Then she suddenly figured out the system.  The business owner should maybe have a camera pointing at the cashier as well so they can see how she treats customers. As a business owner I know this is extremely important to me so I hope they take care of that employee because otherwise if they keep people like her people won't be back. I rather drive 20 minutes to my usual place than come here again to deal with people like her.
