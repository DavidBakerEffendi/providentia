This was our go to eatery in New York when I was in college 2001-2005. The few that existed in California have closed since 2005. So I was very excited to see that one existed in Vegas. 

I got my usual grilled chicken pita.  The order taker told the sandwich maker to throw a chicken, and instead of doing it then going back to reorganizing the station (which makes sense cause it takes some time for the chicken to heat) she finished what she was doing first. I then  asked her to change her gloves because I'm very sensitive to onions and peppers which she had been handling. She did it but wasn't very happy about it. 

I guess the new thing they do is steam the pita. She did it before I could stop her. I asked her to use a new unsteamed pita which totally annoyed her. Then we had to wait longer for the chicken to finish. The iceberg lettuce was kind of bitter because it was mostly yellow. Also I'm not liking the slices of cheese. What happened to shredded cheese? Anyways the experience sucked and my pita wasn't very good. I only ate half of it and threw the rest away. I guess I will have to live off my memories.
