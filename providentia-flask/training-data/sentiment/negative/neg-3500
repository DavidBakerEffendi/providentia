I came here because the price seemed to good to be true and as usual it was...

The all you can eat was terrible. The sushi was loosely wrapped and the meats were all gristly. I tried getting some chicken and ended up leaving so much of it on the plate that I was worried they were going to try and charge me for it (this was their policy on the menu that it said they charged you for uneaten food) but it didn't happen.

I'm all for being thrifty but I'd never every go back to this place again.
