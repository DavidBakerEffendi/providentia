Stopped at Saddle Ranch before Coyotes game March 18. Party of 4 including my 4 year old grandson.  My daughter in law was given a plastic up because we were told they didn't have any other glasses clean.  Ordered our food, waited 40 minutes went and spoke to the manager on duty about our long wait for food.  He told me he would take care of it.  Returned from kitchen and told us that it was a crazy weekend & food would arrive soon.  Waited another 20 minutes and the food never arrived.  Terrible service, place was a mess and the restaurant was not even half full.
