We me and my girlfriend like pizza. We have tried quite a lot of pizza places here in Calgary, we have not found one not one that is good let alone great. As for this pizzeria I have never been so insulted and   ripped off. This pizza was not pizza it was crap the crust if you can call it crust was made from Bisquick the toppings were not full of flavour all I could taste was salt. The only reason I ate this was it took over an hour to deliver this travesty of a pizza and I was hungry. I am shocked amazed at the positive comments. Does anyone have any taste? I called to complain about there  so called pizza and asked them if they would do something about there horrible pizza but I knew the answer before I asked "no sorry we can do nothing". Typical all they care about is they have my money you are S.O.L. Lesson learned. This establishment does not need to be here in Calgary. We have decided that we can make better pizza than this so called pizza restaurant. Taste buds beware stay away from this pizza it is absolutely taste less. The rating of one star mean nothing it id the only way to post my review this place sucks.Nuff said.
