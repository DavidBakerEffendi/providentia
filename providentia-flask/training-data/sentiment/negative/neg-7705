Ok so I considered not leaving such a bad review because the food is really good here. It's kinda a hidden gem but that completely made this a bad experience is the service. From the start we waited what seemed like forever just to have our waiter, yes a waiter. Not waitress and I think this is where their downfall was. He didn't come over to say hi welcome or take an order until almost 20 minutes into us being seated. Red flag right there! We ordered and waited again. I don't know how long it was sitting at the counter before he picked it up but food was only mildly hot, so not fresh at all. He asked if we need anything I said yes we want some ranch and mayo. He wanted to stand there and tell me that I don't need it because they put mayo on it already. Hmmm I looked at him and told him again mayo and ranch yet again. He said ok and walked off. It took almost 10 minutes for that, ridiculous. Ok so we ate and like I said food is delicious and the portions are huge but just a heads up you do pay a lot to have big portions. Nothing under $10 in this diner. So we were ready to leave and our waiter was nowhere to be found and this went on for 30 minutes. No drink refill, no checking on customers, nothing! Finally he emerges from GOD knows where and we just ask for a box and our check. I was happy just to leave. It was such a poor experience this time I was very disappointed. Won't be back for a while.
