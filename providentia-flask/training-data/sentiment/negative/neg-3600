We went for dinner before a show and were expecting an awesome dinner. Upon arriving we were very impressed by the cute decor and how busy the restaurant was, however things went downhill very quickly. We waited at least 15 minutes before our waiter came to take or order, and judging by the speediness of the staff we placed our drink appetizer and entree orders all at once. Luckily the waitstaff in charge of water came around to fill our waters at least five times. We waited another 15 minutes before our appetizers came (missing one we ordered) and another 5 before our beverages arrived (missing one we ordered, yet again). The wine ordered came in strange "mouthwash" glasses that were hot...yes...HOT. When we notified our waiter of the missing orders he apologized and ran off yet again. Finally, nearly 45 minutes after we ordered our entrees the food finally came...and with all the built up anticipation fell completely flat. The scallops were sandy, the chicken was dryer than the saltine challenge and the bolognese and curry chicken unremarkable. Portions are tiny and served in a manner that would suggest dining at a much nicer establishment. I had high hopes for this place but it was sorely lacking in service and quality for the price. Maybe if they spent more time working on service and less time hand stamping their menus with honeysalt logos I would have enjoyed it more. Might try in three months but I would stay away for now...
