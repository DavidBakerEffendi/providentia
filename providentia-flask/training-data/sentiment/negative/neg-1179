One star might seem extreme, but this place - despite the decent sushi - has awfully slow and oblivious service. My bf and I waited for a half hour without acknowledgement by their sole waitress. They give preference to takeout orders and ignore those who take the time to walk inside. We ultimately chose to leave. Take your customers for granted, and your success won't last forever. They've certainly lost our business.
