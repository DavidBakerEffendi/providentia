Just to be clear, this is a review of the administration at this place.  I'm sure the food, drinks, atmosphere, and golf are fantastic and fun.  Because of this, I figured that planning a small business meeting here would be a good idea.  However, I didn't know that dealing with TopGolf is filled with more red tape and needless rules than the IRS combined with the DMV.

I just spent 2 weeks trying to arrange a small meeting where I would give TopGolf over $700.  Below is what I wanted on Saturday, November 14th.  All hourly rates are on their website or were listed on the event planning PDFs they sent me. 

* Conference room from 9am to 3pm @ $40/hr ($240 total)
* Hitting Bay from 3pm to 5pm and 5pm to 8pm @ $35 and $45/hr, respectively ($205 total)
* Food/beverage minimum of $300 that could be applied both in the conference room and hitting bay (for some reason, a food/beverage minimum is required to get the conference room)

They turned my offer down and said they were already making too many concessions in their previous proposal.  Bummer.

Anyway, everybody I talked to was very friendly and eager to help in the typical corporate fashion.  You know....pretending to give a darn, but really just wanting to move on to a person/company with deeper pockets.
