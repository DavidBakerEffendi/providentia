Just yuck..  my 1st choice of fast food failed because it closed early.. so my husband said panda..   wow years since ive been here and what a sad mess.. everyone in front of me wanted stuff they were out of ..  place was busy but out of food.. lots of walk outs and people waiting 6-10 mins for orders.. i dont eat fast food but wanted  egg roll but they were so burnt cooked by untrained or lazy people.  Soooo yucky..
