Ew. I think I'm still healthy after eating here, but it was the worst lunch I have had! Sorry to the really nice staff at this casino, but everything was cold or lukewarm. It was 4th of July! Use a Grill and grill some burgers and hot dogs!  Have some grilled veggies. I had cold Mac and cheese, and a premade hamburger with a too small bun. The salad was fresh and good, according to my husband. The food looked so bad that I resorted to eating the safest things, corn bread and apple pie filling. I ate one bite of green beans, they were cold but fine. The best part of the lunch!!!!!,,,,I won $200  right after the lunch!!!! Will not be back or recommend.......sorry. Ew.
