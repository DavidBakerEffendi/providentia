I was here a year ago and hopefully expected differently today. I ordered jjampong which it was eatable, jjachangmyun was nasty, pork tangsooyuk which it came out like oily crackers, worst then a year old McDonald's french fries, I also ordered orange chicken which the color was no dought orange, but taste was no near and very soggy. I live here in Vegas, but don't spend your money here, there are alot of great restaurants with excellent service. I'm Korean but this place make all Koreans sad :(
