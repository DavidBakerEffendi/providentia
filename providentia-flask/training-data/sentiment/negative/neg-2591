Ordered lettuce wraps. They were served to our table dirty. With a sizable clump of black dirt on one of them. Sent them back of course. Fresh lettuce was then served. New York style pizza. It was okay. Nothing fabulous. Parmesan cheese is not fresh, Unfortunately. With all of the amazing restaurants in Vegas, it is highly likely we will not return to this one.
