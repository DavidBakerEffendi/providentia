Dog shit. Server was rude from the first minute. I'm apparently a bother to be waited on. I order I flight of beer which was pleasantly all NC beer  I order a spin dip and it came in a plastic container as a greasy pile of dip. Totally reheated out of the Applebee's catalog. Asked for salsa or sour cream and was never given either.  Totally not worth the money.  Go eat McDonalds or something for a better meal :(
