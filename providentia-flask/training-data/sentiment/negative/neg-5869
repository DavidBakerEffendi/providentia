What a disappointment this place was! I was told by a friend about the amazing duck dishes this place used to serve and last week found myself with an opportunity to check the place out. Let's just say I will not be going back.

My colleague and I walked in at 12:30 pm. I was afraid that we would have to wait for a table as this was right in the middle of the lunch rush, but shockingly, there was not a table occupied in the whole joint. This should have been a red flag but we stayed, regardless.

While looking at the menu I realized it was a cash only restaurant (and the menu items are all fully priced). This relegated me to the cash that I had in my wallet -- bummer.

They have an excessively long menu and after a great deal of reading decided I'd just get the chicken lo mein since I thought that was un-mess-up-able. I thought wrong! I was presented with a huge dish of the nastiest tasting, ugliest pile of beige. The chicken was little more than tiny pieces of salty poached rib meat and gristle.

Side note: the server had a fungal infection under his fingernails. That's not exactly the last thing I want to see before I dig into a meal...gross.

I wound up eating about 6 mouthfuls of noodles before I could tolerate no more. The horrible taste stayed with me all day. I will never return.
