I went back here after a great experience the first time.... I had a friend here visiting from Australia and wanted to show him something different and special.... I up talked this place from my good first time memories...

We waited a while for our table, even though we had reservations... But, got a drink at the bar... All good....

Service then was quick... I ordered the same think I ordered last time... Chicken Rio.... He ordered the lasagna.... 

The chicken was rubber.... I could tell not freshly cooked!!! Waiter came to the table to see how we were and I said, "not so good" I told the waiter it was inedible.. He took my plate and that was it.... I shared the mediocre lasagna with my Aussie and left so embarrassed!!! No compensation NOTHING!!

Never going back.... Unless it is free of course...
