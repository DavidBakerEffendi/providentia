I went with my children to this McDonalds today. So I ordered 2 kids meals and then 2 times Nr 7 medium with Dr Pepper. 
The staff of this McDonalds is absolut not capable to run this place. The girl on the register gave me 2 kids cups and then I asked where my cups are from the 2 meals? 
What meals? She asked
She put in a 10 piece chicken nugget order and not the 2 meals in medium with my drinks. 
A guy comes up and he got no clue how to fix it. Me terrible annoyed already. Then the manager comes over and I said you might want to train your Employees better to listen what your customers order. 
All I get to hear is the girl is new, she's been here for 2 weeks. Well if she doesn't know how to listen to a customer, she can't take a order. And if she has issues with taking orders, I don't know why she's still working there or why there's not someone else standing besides her helping doing the right thing. 
Needless to say, I wanted a refund and left that place.
