Just left this POS restaurant feeling disgusted and disgusting. Long story short, found steel wool in my food. The staff was dismissive at best--offered to void the cost (after I expressed A LOT of disbelief). I recognize that this was a genuine human mistake, but currently, I can't get myself to really give a shit.
