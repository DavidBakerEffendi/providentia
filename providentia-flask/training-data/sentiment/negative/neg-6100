10/28 lunch. Bad wings.  Used to be my favorite in town!  Sierra Nevada keg was stale.  Server is non responsive!  I won't come back. Ok gm erik came out and apologized for the visit.  Not sure it sunk in to him.  No offer to credit bad food.  He is short staffed I guess?
I'll love to spend 50 on lunch somewhere else.
