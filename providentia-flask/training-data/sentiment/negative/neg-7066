This place is a mess. I've been to plenty Robertos, but this one takes the cake. None of the sodas had any carbonation, hell scratch that, none of the the drink dispense fully worked. This place over all is fucking nasty, don't know if it was the crew that day or just the management. I'm glad the Robertos closer to where I live have better quality than this shit hole.
