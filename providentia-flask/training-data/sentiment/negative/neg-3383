Stayed at the Palms for a few days so boyfriend and I checked out the back room burger spot. Over priced burgers and fries. Wasn't impressed at all with the food. Server wasn't very friendly either. Now I see why they are handing out 20% off coupons . Dont see this place staying in business very long.  And by the way this is coming from a local not a tourist. Too many other spots to go for a good burger thats worth $11.00
