Since the service sucks at this place, I thought of ordering takeout. I called yesterday and spoke with the owner Afzalbhai, I asked for his opinion on some of the items on the menu, his reply was quote" I don't have time for this, I have a lot of catering orders and I am busy, can't discuss the menu with you, bye" and he hung up the phone. This guy is rude and has no concept about customer service. Don't bother going to this place, the service sucks and the owner does not give crap about your business.
