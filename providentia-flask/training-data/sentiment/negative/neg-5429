This McDonald has 2 drive thru lanes but often only one is open and it is poorly designed. As soon as a few cars get in line it blocks the entire parking lot and makes the whole process very frustrating. 

And the only time I want ice cream the machine is broken so I sat in the drive thru for nothing. Waste of time and unacceptable.
