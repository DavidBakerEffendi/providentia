I'll keep it simple:
Music is WAY, WAY too loud (and I am in my 30's People will try it once for the novelty, but won't come back because they know they'll have to scream over dinner.   Note to the restaurant:  Let people talk as they eat, and then turn it up after 8:30pm for partiers.  
One of the "part-owners" who doubled as our server was really patronizing and rude to me during a few interactions.  It was the first time EVER that I didn't leave a tip (and I used to be a waitress, meaning that you pretty much have to spit in my food for me NOT to leave you a tip).  No, he did not spit in my food, but he was pretty, darn rude.  I'll just leave it at that.      
Food is NO WHERE near the quality of a Postino's.  
Bottom-line: I would genuinely love, love, love places like this to survive because I live around here and want a more unique dining experience, but this place left a bad place in my mouth.  
Go if your curiosity beckons, but go ready to SHOUT over dinner.
