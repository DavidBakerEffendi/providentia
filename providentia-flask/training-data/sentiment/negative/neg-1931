Ridiculous, ordered a Pizza at 10:00 pm (I received my confirmation email) Pizza never came, no one answered the phones.called the next day to figure out what happened, the manager didn't even bother to give me the curtesy of calling me back. Don't bother coming here, usually they serve food cold/burnt or the wrong order,  the one on 35th and Thunderbird is better.
