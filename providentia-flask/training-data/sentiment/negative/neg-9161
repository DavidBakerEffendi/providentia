Awful!! Party of six and never even was acknowledged. Wow!  This place is for sure a place to avoid. I can't comment on the food because we never had a chance to order. We stood in the bar area for 10 minutes and had to initiate contact with the bar tender before even being welcomed. At this point, we decided to leave.
