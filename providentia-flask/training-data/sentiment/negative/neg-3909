Got so irratated trying to order a Matcha Grren tea with almond milk I finally had to walk out. All 3 employees drilled me so hard on my diet needs and what allergies I may or may not have i got pissed off.i never mentioned having any allergies. I order the same thing several times a week and have never had to put up with this kind of questioning.
