Service was okay and food was good (drinks were a little slow coming from the bar to the hibachi grill area). We were a party of 9 and were charged a mandatory 20% tip. I have no problem tipping 20% for good service, and the service was not bad. The reason ii have given such a low rating was the bad business practice of forcing tip on an after tax dollar amount. All tips should be given on before tax. I am not tipping the state of ohio. WHen i brought this to he manager's attention, he basically said too bad and this is how all places do it. He did not really care. I will not come back based on principal. Plenty of good hibachi places to go to that will adopt proper business practices.
