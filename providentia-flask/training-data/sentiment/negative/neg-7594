I thought about writing a long review about my entire experience, but I'll just sum it up by saying that this restaurant is HORRIBLE. The staff is horrible, the food is horrible, and the wait to get food is also ridiculous. I wanted to try and look beyond the recent bad reviews this restaurant got but was that a huge mistake. I now know why they are rated so bad and why they will continue to be rated so bad. We wanted to order a tamale with our meal and our server grabbed one of the menus and pointed to the delicious, authentic looking tamale pictured on the menu and said "you see this tamale here? this is not what you're going to get here. This is food photography and is meant to make food look good. The tamales here are not good and I would not recommend them." At first I was pretty shocked that she would bad mouth the food there since she worked there, but was appreciative that she was honest if that were true. If it stopped there that would have been great, but then she goes on to say... "it's like if you guys were craving miso soup.." We stared at her in disbelief and I could not believe what this ignorant server was saying to me and my family. Then she continues on to say "wait, you guys are not Japanese I'm sensing... are you?" and I politely told her no, we're Korean. She then tries to save herself but we're already angry and tuned her out. 45 minutes pass and our food finally comes out. The steak in the ultimate burrito was so chewy like rubber and tasted really odd, the refried beans were watered down and gross, everything we ordered was drenched in cheese and sour cream and that's probably because the meat they use is not good so they try to mask it. Do not come here... there are millions of other Mexican restaurants that serve way better food and have don't employ ignorant people to serve customers.
