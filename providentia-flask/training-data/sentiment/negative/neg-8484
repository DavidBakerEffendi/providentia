Stopped here for dinner to go for my sister and I. 
Ordered sweet and sour chicken it was over cooked, added fried rice which was mush.  The dumplings and teriyaki chicken we're good.  The California roll made with imitation crab and seriously tasteless.  

Decided that the best part of the meal was the Nithing Bundt cakes that i took home for desert...
