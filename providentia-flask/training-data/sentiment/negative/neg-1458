Don't come here!!! Unless you wanna die from the insane amount of salt in their food.

I had a gift card to use up and with their free app coupon, decided to check it out.

First, the spinach dip was so oily and salty, it was horrible.

We both got burgers, the meat was good, but it was SOO salty, couldn't eat it without drinking water between every bite. Same goes with the sides, I couldn't even touch my salad with the mountain of dressing on it. It was ridiculous.... Which is something considering I like my food salty.

THEN it took us 15 mins to get the bill and a good 30+ mins to pay and get out. I honestly wanted to just leave because of how ridiculously slow it was.

I will never be back here... Or any Milestone. Overall just a complete waste of my night.
