I would subtract stars for this location. The downtown Mesa location is like another restaurant. It is almost false advertising to call this Pete's!  No messy fish sandwich?  Are you kidding me?  That's like no Big Mac at McDonald's!  Do us all a favor and close this joke of a restaurant!  Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!
