I really wanted to like this place. I went there for my birthday as i was craving for Mexican food. We had made reservations and when we arrived we were seated immediately. However, we soon found out that the service thereafter was extremely slow. We ordered for nachos which took 45 mins to come. They were really bland with no taste. Next we ordered for baja fish tacos, crispy chicken tinga tacos and some veggie tacos. Again the order took 45-50 mins to come. The fish tacos were kind of ok but the rest of the food was just meh. Needless to say i am not visiting again.
