I purchased a Groupon to the NatGeo Photo exhibit last year.  I couldn't attend, however, held onto the Groupon because I wanted to see if I could apply the amount paid to a ticket for the same event that returned less than a year later.  

Calling the box office with this simple question, the rep sounded combative, and made an ASSumption that I expected her to do something over the phone.   I just wanted a simple answer.  All she had to say is go ask in person.  I said fine.  I asked her if she happened to know when tickets were going to be available for the Epicurean Affair.  Once again - "We don't know when, you have to ask the front in person.  We're just the call center."  This is the box office number listed on the website and they don't know anything about their future events?  Why have a call center if they tell you to get your answers "in person" ?

I think the only function of the box office call center is to sell tickets.  As far as answering questions, they're useless.
