We went once and had awesome food and equally good service. The last time that we went was awful. It seems like the staff has a lot of turnover because I did not recognize any of the workers. When we walked in, the neck tattooed host was scratching his crotch and rubbing his face. We were very, very hungry and figured that since he wasn't a cook, we would reluctantly let it go. I explained to him my special dietary needs and asked him if there were any dishes that they could customize for me. He went to the kitchen and quickly came back with a "no" answer. The host did not care to work with me; their food is prepared a certain way and that was that. So, we left.
