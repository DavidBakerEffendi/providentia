I don't have a lot to add, paying cover to drink a pint isn't something I like to do, but I do understand that the bands need to get paid. And the bands come from a-far. 
This place is totally NOT my style. But, I was with a few other folks from the East Coast. So, the only point to going to Grace O'Malley's is to reunite with othe East Coasters and listen to bands from the East Coast. 
I'm not against East Coasters, I can't wait to visit Halifax where I can drink a pint there.
