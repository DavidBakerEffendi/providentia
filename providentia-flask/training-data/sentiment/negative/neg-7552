Service was poor. Not enough wait staff for number of patrons. 

Ordered the fish and chips for lunch which were over greasy and leaked onto the plate. Fries were frozen and fried with same texture as McDonald's fries. Also they were soggy. For the same price point you can get higher quality fish and chips almost anywhere else. Girlfriend ordered a chicken crepe that looked like an enchilada because it was swimming in cheese. Not worth the price and will not return.
