Not the usual that would expect from Dunn's. Came in for breakfast with the family Sunday morning.  Eggs were cold, potatoes were cold. Service was polite but slow. As my wife put it "The best part of the breakfast was the slice of orange on the plate". I hope things improve for this "famous" place.
