My boyfriend and I were asked if we wanted to be seated in the back patio area where the menu is much smaller. I am vegan so I said I was fine with it as long as there was something I could eat as a main course. The waiter said that the special of the day was a veggie pizza. I asked if it had cheese, to which he said he wasn't sure but he would ask, then he came right back to say no, it did not. It was also written on the specials board, where it listed the ingredients (it did not list cheese). What mattered though, is that the host said it didn't have cheese.

So we we ordered chips and guacamole for starter, I ordered the pizza, my bf ordered his main. So when the main ends up coming, the pizza has cheese on it. My server and I realized the error that had occurred here and I asked if they could please remake it without cheese. He said the kitchen does not do modifications. He then asked if there was anything else I could order but I said no because I specifically sat in the back patio area because the host specifically said the pizza did not have cheese. 
Then he asked if we wanted to cancel my bf's food too, probably thinking we would just go because I can't eat anything else. He did not offer to discount our bill of the drinks and chips and guacamole we ate. I honestly would have expected more than just, "I'm sorry, the host is new here"... he would not accommodate the fact that I am vegan and that I was told that the food I was getting was too. Very rude. He did not offer to discount our meal. 

The server's politeness did not make up for the lack of effort and caring about your customers.
