**Disclaimer** Did not dine here, but was looking forward to...

I made reservations back in October 2017 for New Years Eve dinner on OpenTable.  On 12/30/2017, at ~5pm, I received a phone call from the owner demanding my credit card information, in the event that we did not show, or cancelled last minute, that the restaurant would charge the card $50/person.  I told the owner that I would call him back to confirm (as I was not comfortable giving out this information in a public place), but he instead decided to cancel my reservation in OpenTable.  

While I don't disagree with a deposit policy for NYE dinner at a restaurant, I didn't think the way by which this owner decided to go about it was appropriate.  He sounded extremely perturbed by other customers calling and canceling last minute, and made reference to that in the call.  Very rude and condescending tone on the phone as well.

I am happy the reservation was cancelled, as it would have been bothersome to know I spent money on an establishment that treats potential customers in that manner.
