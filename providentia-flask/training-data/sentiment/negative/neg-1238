This place is honestly not worth the $25 comp. I've eaten here a few times and at most of the buffets in town. The selection is very limited: pasta station carving station Italian and Chinese sections salad bar and desserts. All are of mediocre quality AT BEST with the pasta station being the best part of this place since it's made fresh. Absolutely do not pay to eat here.
