Wow ... f'n nightmare I knocked my egg rolls off counter. I call the busboy over to tell him and he proceeds to step on one of them. He then calls my waiter over and shows him. The waiter picked up my egg rolls and he passes the trashcan two feet away, walks back to the fry cook who I can plainly see over the counter, says something in Chinese, then hands him the egg rolls and the cook threw them back into the fryer!!!!! I WENT BERSERK! Filthy scumbags! I've eaten there a million times over the years. NEVER AGAIN! Avoid this place like the plague. Not only was he going to try to serve me stepped on egg rolls, but he also contaminated the entire batch of fry oil. If they pull this shit in plain view... whats going on in the back kitchen????? I called the Venetian Management, and Venetian Food and Beverage Manager and they were both appalled.
