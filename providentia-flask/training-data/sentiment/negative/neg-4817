The food was good be service was very slow. We ordered a shake waited 15 mins before we learned the main ingredient was out of stock. Our food made it to the table still no shake since we changed the shake order. A table was sat near us was never greeted got tired of waiting they left without eating at all. At the end we sat just waiting to pay so we could leave over all not a good experience may not go back.
