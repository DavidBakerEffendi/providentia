I am sure that the 4 things on the menu are well done, but to have only 4 options for dinner is very puzzling for me. The wine is $16 a glass which is pure robbery (especially for the wines they were offering) and the chairs are so uncomfortable we decided to get up and leave to go some where else. Sorry lemon but I don't understand how you could have regulars with such a limited menu!?
