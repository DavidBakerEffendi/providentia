I wouldn't complain too much about the food.  I enjoyed the spicy crab sushi roll and I would come back for the food if they changed everything else.  

Prices.
First, they use paper plates, which I'm fine with, but $16 bucks for chicken teriyaki/shrimp combo? Only after I got my food, I found out you can change your rice to fried rice for an additional $3??.  Umm $19 for a combo plate ... ouch ! you gotta step your game up.  The portions are too small.  Use real plates instead of paper or serve it to us restaurant style because I doubt this family orientated neighborhood is going to pay over $20 bucks for 1 person to eat.  Let me get my money's worth.

Variety of Food:
The name "sushi express", you're thinking a variety of sushi but there is not much on the menu.  Also no descriptions on any of the rolls so you would need to ask them what is in it.  Maybe a suggestion would be adding bento boxes or lunch specials so people can have a combo of hibachi and sushi instead of paying full price if I want both.   

Atmosphere:
Seating is limited so if you have a large group stay away.  No music, no decorations so you can hear everything and everyone. 

I hope they change some things up because I love seeing new places succeed !!! I know our neighborhood was excited about something like this opening.   For now, if you want a chicken teriyaki bowl I would go down the street to teriyaki madness for 7 bucks and if you want your sushi fix, go to your favorite sushi restaurant because you'll be paying the same price!
