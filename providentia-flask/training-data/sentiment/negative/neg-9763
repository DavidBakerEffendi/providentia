I really don't like writing bad reviews... But o well.. We come to this place all the time... However, we will never be returning to this location. We are really big on customer service, but everyone has a bad day every one in awhile so we don't pass judgement...but this time I had to complain, im not sure of the guys name but geez was he rude. The lady that helped me was very sweet.. But I couldn't hear her over the jerk in the back making my sandwich that was talking crap about me... I called the wrong store on accident to place my order. When I got there he said there were no orders waiting and thats when i realized i had called the wrong location... I felt bad and said it was okay they didnt have to make it.. The lady that was helpful said it was okay we will make it anyways they still had 10 mins anyways. Then the this kid  started talking crap saying things like i was making up that I called the wrong store so that I can just get them to make my sandwich 10mins before they closed and  "that's a good one" and continued to yell out that next time he was gonna walk into a place and "try that one" They close 9pm.. It takes all but 5mins to make a quick sandwich. Bad day or night...a customer doesn't need to hear that. I tipped them anyway just to kill them with kindness! From now on I'll make the drive to another location!!!
