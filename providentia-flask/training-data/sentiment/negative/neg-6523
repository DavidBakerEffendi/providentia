The bartender here seems a little over worked. When I walked in i was told to-go orders was taken at the bar. I waited 10mins b4 the tender even came back to the bar. She was in the back packing up some1 order. When she came back she handed the guy his order then proceeded to make drinks for another party at the bar. She told me 1 min. After she was done making drinks. She ran outside to catch the guy she just gave the food to because she forgot to take his money. While she was outside another guy (white) walked in. And sat next to me at the bar. She finally came back in and just completely ignored me. I said excuse me. Are you gonna take my order? Because I have been standing here a while b4 this guy walked in. She told me with a attitude No drink orders come first. I quickly asked for someone else. Soon as I did that she began to take my order. It's so obvious she needs help. I will NEVER come here again. And I don't recommend anyone else does.
