The very first time I was there was so great. We had beer and wings....perfect.... fast forward to staff drama and cross contamination.... OMG.... smoking outside without washing hands....dropping raw food in the fryer and on the grill with no hand washing.... saw ONE pair of gloves....and Zero hands washed.... When I asked about it, I got WAY too much attitude.... staff battles we're VERY UNCOMFORTABLE....... It was fun when the sisters we're there....they take time off...Horror!
