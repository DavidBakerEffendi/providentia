Banh cuon is made fresh, although they have become stingy over the years with the portion of meats.
DO NOT order their drinks as they make it half ass and not authentic. 
I ordered a soy drink cold, the lady who runs the place made it from packaged powder and hot water then added ice... face palm. 
Took a sip and threw it out, horrible drink that costed $2.50 , more than the powdered soy from the grocery store itself. 
Service is terrible, the owners do not have any sense of customer service and had an attempt to snatch the menu out of my hand when I wasn't finished ordering which resulted in a mini tug of war with the menu, a big wtf moment. 
They only accept cash unless their son is working because he's the only one who knows how to work the moneris machine.. another face palm. Shouldn't run a business if you don't know how to accept payment and refuse to make drinks the authentic Vietnamese way. 
1 star only for their banh cuon dishes and because I can't rate it lower than 1 star.
