Why didn't I just go to the first watch off mayfield rd? Came here for a healthy birthday breakfast after the gym and I've never met the most uninviting people. I asked the hostess about a booth and she replied as she walked away from me she didn't walk me to my table just set the menus down at the table and left. My server didn't give me eye contact just asked me "what would you like" my response was what is your name? I later found out it was mike. What ever happened to hi my name is.....I'll will be your server today. Food....just ok but Lisa was very pleasant
