DOWNGRADE. I'm adding a new category thanks to a conversation with the manager of Cibo. It is the U-LIST. Unbelievable. Just returned from Cibo and could not believe the manager. 

The main course was raw and there was no offer to adjust the bill. She stated that our dining experience was not significantly interrupted while having a mouthful of raw meat. Apparently, I was unaware that raw meat as part of the dining experience is a minor event. It then follows that the new Cibo customer service policy as of yesterday, October 1 is: If you have a significant interruption in the quality of the food served or level of service at our establishment, the customer will not be offered an adjustment of the bill or any other compensation for our error. 

Anyone who pretends that others should accept improperly cooked food and a poor dining experience without some form of compensation, while they themselves would not accept the same is unacceptable. Would like to hear from others who have had to deal with this manager. 

Sorry, but it's difficult to give this establishment future business as a result of this unpleasant experience. The one star rating is extreme and given the lack of vision, communication and problem solving ability on the part of the manager it is warranted. 

As always - You decide. For real. Unbelievable.
