Not good...terrible food, and even worse service.. The papaya salad definitely had mold in it and was then told by, whom I am assuming was a owner, that it was their recipe and that it was fine.. The pad Thai was mediocre at best...very dull and a single note of overly sweet and sour sauce.. Felt ignored the whole time after telling server about the papaya salad... AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, the server tried to short my change over $10.. Pretty bold to tip yourself after a dining experience like that! Will never return, which is too bad because I love good Thai food, I highly suggest you try Thai Basil if you want a great Thai food experience! I would give no stars possible, you can give that one star to the beautiful statues put in front and the great decor.
