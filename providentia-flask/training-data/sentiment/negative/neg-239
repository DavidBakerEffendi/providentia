YUCK! Whomever said that this was award winning chicken, obviously has never had a piece of fried chicken in their whole entire lives. Absolutely horrible! Overpriced and overrated. Even the fries just tasted like potato wrapped oil bombs. I could have went to Kentucky Fried Chicken and gotten better tasting chicken than this. Disgusting. You have been warned.
