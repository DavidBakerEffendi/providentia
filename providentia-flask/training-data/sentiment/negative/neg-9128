The only saving grace of the awful restaurant was the guacamole . As I entered the restaurant entrance there was a pack rat full of smokers blocking the way in. Only to find out its the employees bitching about the customers inside . We were greeted by an Unfriendly senior Latina waitress not bothering to look our way, as if she was too tired to deal with another tourist as it was getting late 7pm Our food is at the table in less than three min  tamales with chile relllenos it was buried in a thick gloppy green  sauces that look and tasted like to much cornstarch was added . it look as if some one threw up on the plate just terrible ,a bland texture and taste along with a mushy non forgiving tamale . This place lacks so much . It need a complete head to toe makeover from decor to. Food  and honestly they  need to get rid of the front staff even if is is family a lazy group of unfriendly zombies I hardly call this Mexican as this place seems to of given up a long time ago Shame on my hotel  to suggest this  Pit hole I will be speaking to them . Now I wait in my room to start felling the effect of this abortion of food and what it is going to do to my stomach
