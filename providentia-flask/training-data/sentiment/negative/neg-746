Came here at 8:50pm to grab a smoothie and they were closed...which is odd considering they're supposed to be open until 9pm. The worst part is there was an employee standing right at the door as I tried to open it getting the trash bag and she wouldn't even look up! She knew damn well that they should of been open still. It doesn't take more then 5 minutes to make a smoothie, but I'm sure she didn't want to have to stay to clean up. Horrible customer service! You should have your doors open until you're actually closed! She then went to the back as I started taking pictures of the time and how the lights are off.
