The Green Regime is part of a pharmacy. It looks a little weird from the outside, not your typical smoothie place... Once you are on the side, it looks more like a smoothie place, though. Kinda weird, but ok.

I went in 1 hour and 10 minutes before closing. Nobody was there. After 3-4 minutes, a head appeared from the kitchen. The woman told us that she couldn't make any food because she 'just turned the grill off'. She was adamant that because she was closing soon, she couldn't do any food.

Apparently, a wrap requires a grill (news to me!) or at least, a wrap requires more than 1 hour and 10 minutes to make? I hope not!

We all left. If somebody cannot be bothered to work within the last HOUR of their shift, they obviously cannot put that effort into doing their job. Who knows what food or drink items we would end up with... Probably would have skimped on ingredients so that she could go home early.

If you want a pricely smoothie inside a pharmacy, sure, go here.

Bottom line, is that there are much better places with better atmosphere and staff that do their jobs. 1/10.
