Ordered $60+ worth of food and when I got to the restaurant they were still making the order. When she was done with making all the sandwiches she just threw them in a bag and I had to take them all out of the bag and put them in correctly while she just watched.  She didn't offer to help or say sorry. Also, I was missing my salad and when I asked she grabbed it from the refrigerator below and also threw it on the table. I felt as if I was bothering her more than being a paying customer!  I know they where backed up but that doesn't mean they should skimp on customer service.

Lastly, I ordered a drink with my meal and she forgot to ring it up and instead of just comping the drink she made me pay another $3 which I just charged $60+ on my credit card and I wasn't about to charge another $3.  

Not impressed at all with this place.
