Worst service ever my Togo order sat over 15 minutes until I asked to have it I'll never come back here. The cashier was slow incompetent and rude. The manager was gossiping with the waitresses while food sat waiting to be served. I bet my food is cold. 

Got home and I was right the bisque and gravy ice cold my over medium eggs were over easy. The hash browns were not hydrated enough so they were hard and cold. Stay away from this s Denny unless you want crappy food and worse service.
