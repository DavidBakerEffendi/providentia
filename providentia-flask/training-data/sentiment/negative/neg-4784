So after returning the chicken kabobs twice because they weren't cooked I decided I didn't want to try for a third time. I told the owner that my chicken still is pink and his reaction was priceless. He told me people like their chicken undercooked here and I told him the the other food seemed cold he actually started eating food from my plate with his hands. Telling me that my food isn't cold. My wife couldn't believe her eyes and either could I. My wife did like her food but the owner acted like a small child.
