Ugh, we really should have read the reviews before coming here.

We decided last Saturday night to ditch the Arcadia or Scottsdale dinner scene and drive up to Cave Creek for the evening. Thank goodness for the great weather and live band outside at Heralds that we could hear from our outdoor table. 

When we arrived, we asked if could sit outside (we saw seats available when we were walking in). The hostess went outside and then came back to let us know there were none available and we would have to sit inside, then walked away. Not wanting to sit inside (all I saw was an ugly red interior and a huge, empty restaurant), I asked the other hostess how long the wait would be. Luckily, she went outside and there were two tables for us to choose from! Thank goodness for her.

We asked for water right away, that came about 10 minutes later. They did have a nice beer selection, however, my beer was room temperature, hardly cold. When we ordered, I made sure they had bbq sauce as that's what I dip my hamburgers in (weird, i know) - she said that was no problem. So our meals came - apparently they "discontinued" carrying bbq sauce. My burger was just ok. My fries were good though! My boyfriend's steak was barely edible. He said his baked potato was the highlight of his meal.

Oh, and not that this matters, but we found grammar errors on the menu! And, the menu itself is quite basic in food offerings. Nothing unique at all.

I think this is the first one-star review I've ever given. However, it was sadly, a huge disappointment.
