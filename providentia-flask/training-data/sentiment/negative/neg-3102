Other than the cruise itself the food was awful and the boat is old and I was glad we sat alone I didn't care for the flying bugs in our window seats I know I personally killed 2-3 and that was gross until I looked behind us and notice our neighbors window seal had a huge spiderweb of these flying bugs In His window thankful we didn't have to look at those during the meal that was not worth the cost. I wouldn't suggest this cruise to anyone, the best thing was the beautiful weather and they had no control over that . I hate to critique a place so hard but honesty is the best policy .
