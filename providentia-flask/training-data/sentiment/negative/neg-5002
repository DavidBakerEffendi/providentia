Just left this Hooter's after eating the most foulest oyster.  I have never tasted something so horrible.  I pray I don't get food poisoning from it.  Told our waitress about it and got an "Oh", that's it! nothing more. The overall service was fair, nothing great.  Food was fair, but the bad oyster and the total lack of concern is the reason for me giving one star. I never give one star.  If I die tonight let this be a warning to all who thinking eating oysters at Hooter's is good idea.  It's not!!!!
