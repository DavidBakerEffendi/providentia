Was looking forward to getting takeout for dinner, would be ready for pickup in 15-20 minutes.  When I arrived to pickup my order (20 minutes later) I waited in line about 5 minutes and asked if my order was ready and was told they didn't know.  I asked when it would be ready, they could not tell me.....so since it was 8pm on a Sunday night I ended up at Wendy's.
