I've been on the hunt for amazing Mexican food since we moved to Arizona. You would think that Mexican food would be comparable to that of California because of it's location, but that is definitely not the case. It's been disappointment after disappointment. Service was prompt; however, food was bland. My burrito was full of carne asada; however, it was flavorless. Thank goodness that I took my meal to go. It allowed me to add carne asada seasoning, improving the taste of the meal. No rice or beans in my burrito either. Don't go. It's not worth your money! Stay home and make your own carne asada burritos.
