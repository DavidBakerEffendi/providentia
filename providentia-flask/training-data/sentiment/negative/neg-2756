My mom ordered the biscuits and gravy, took one bite and knew instantly it was horrible! I even took a bite and I couldn't eat them at all. The gravy was putrid!! We informed the waitress that they were horrible and asked for a menu. She did not ask if we wanted something else in exchange, and didn't offer to remove them from the ticket. So I ended up paying for nasty biscuits and gravy that I didn't even eat. Would not return!
