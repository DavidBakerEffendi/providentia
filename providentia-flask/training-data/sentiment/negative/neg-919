On the third visit to the buffet at The Bellagio I remember the first time was when I got married there 13 years ago we had a nice brunch
The second time that we were there I was with a big group of friends from Los Angeles and it was a typical buffet

But on the very last visit to this buffet with my husband I was unfortunately served a very bad piece of beef Wellington. 

When I got back to the table and ate it I didn't realize that it was bad until I felt a weird sound in my stomach and I said something to my husband and all of a sudden I could not control myself and I actually vomited at the table I didn't even have time to excuse myself it just came up. 

The people around me were aghast
I've never seen someone vomit in a restaurant on the table but it was pretty dramatic
My husband grabbed the plate and said you I believe it's that
The waitress Busser and manager came to the table asking if I was OK
I told the manager to smell the beef Wellington and he refused
It made me extremely angry that the manager refused to smell would had obviously made me sick

It had a rotten smell. 
I was absolutely shocked I grabbed my purse I was so humiliated and embarrassed that I walked out my husband stood there talking to the manager as I just left and went back to our room. 
I never ate or recommended the buffet at the Bellagio ever again
I am not a buffet type person but the Wynn was much better
