This place is nothing BUT express. Waited 20 minutes for two Chicken Kebab Sandwich for take out, and I was the only customer during dinner service.

The sandwich was extremely bland, with barely any seasoning, or lack thereof.

One more thing, the guy who was preparing my sandwich did not wash the lettuce I saw him chopped and he did not wash his hands after handling raw meat either.

I won't go as far as recommending McDonald's instead of this place, but Subway is definitely a wiser choice.
