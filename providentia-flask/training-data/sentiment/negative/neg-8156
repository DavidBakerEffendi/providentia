This has been the worst dining experience of my life to be the least. Three and a half hours it took to serve our party of 20. In the first hour and a half I had not even gotten my second drink. Service was dragging to say the least. When the food finally did come out two and half hours after we ordered the majority was cooked wrong and cold. This was called to the managers attention a blonde woman and she was super unprofessional. We watched her talk to our server and roll her eyes then walk over to us and spit out some half ass apology. I'm not sure why it took 30 minutes to get our server to come get a drink order then another 30 minutes to bring the first drink. Then another 20 before they even took our order it went on and on. My gosh it was pathetic. If I wanted to spend 4 hours at a restaurant and spend as much as we did I'd pick one with much better food and reviews.
