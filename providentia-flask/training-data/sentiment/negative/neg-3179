Not the same Peter Piper Pizza I grew up on. Ordered pickup for extra cheese extra pep and I didn't even get regular cheese. There was no one one in the place or in the parking lot, it's 10pm they don't close till 11. I'm like cool. It's like the workers took absolute no pride in making a pizza that someone else paid for. Total half ass, more like quarter ass job.. The job they did does surely reflect real poorly on the attitude taken on by the employees. Very disappointed, I will make sure not to order one here ever again and notify corporate.
