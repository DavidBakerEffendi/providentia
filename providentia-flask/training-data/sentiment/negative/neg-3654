The service was ok but the food was horrible.  Those who are familiar with authentic Japanese ramen should run away from this place screaming. I've eaten ramen at many places in several countries including Japan and it's one my favorite foods,,,but this time after my wife and I ate less than 1/5 of our respective bowls we became quiet and very sad. I had never imagined that any food especially my favorite dish could give me this much depressing effect. Whenever visitors from Japan ask me if there is any food in Phoenix which they would never be able to find or taste in Japan, then I would proudly claim it's Nishikawa Ramen.
