I dislike writing negative reviews and tend to avoid reviewing fast food chains, as you tend to know what you're getting. However, after not having gone to a Boston Market in at least ten years, this was a massively disappointing let down. To begin with, I checked the menu on here and they didn't even have multiple of the items listed. My girlfriend and I tried the 1/3 Bourbon Bacon Rotisserie Chicken, sides of mashed potatoes and gravy, stuffing, green beans, Mac and cheese, and Parmesan cream corn. The bourbon bacon sauce was so terribly sweet, it only tasted like honey. The special Parmesan corn was nothing like advertised and only the green beans were average, the rest was below mediocre. This meal also cost almost $30, which is way too much for this quality. The staff was at least pleasant though.
