Actually they don't deserve one star. Poor service, really rude and nasty. The wife must have had bigger dreams for her life in America because she seems more than miserable. I am not going to call her racist, yet. I would say the times I have been there she will at least crack a fake smile for the few caucasians that walk in. I tried to blow it off as just a bad day but she's way too consistent. I mean the people in this neighborhood keep your business running and you show up every day without an ounce of gratitude. The wretch won't get another penny from me.
