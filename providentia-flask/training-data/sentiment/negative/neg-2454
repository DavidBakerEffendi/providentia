All I want to do is leave 5 star reviews. Don't you? I'm not a pretentious jerk, I just had a really bad experience at Tom's. Unfortunately it's all due to one server, Eddie.

The big issue was when the bill came and it looked like I was overcharged for my food.  I thought the $6 happy hour tacos meant that the 3 tacos that were normally $17, were $6.  What a deal!  Nope, I was wrong.  The tacos were $6 EACH, which is not a deal.  So when I called Eddie over, all he did was argue with me and tell me I was wrong and that if I wanted, he could charge me $18 instead of $17.  Huh?  Why would I want that?  Instead he just threw up his hands and said "Fine! I'll pay for it then!  Is that what you want?" and walked away.

Soooo as soon as he left, my friends explained to me what Eddie failed to do.  That they were $6 each on the menu.  Oh, shoot, ok!  So when he came back to basically throw the bill at us, I tried to apologize (even though he was rude and didn't deserve) and he wouldn't hear it. "Nope, nope" and walked away.  Good talk.

This meal could have gone one way had "the customer is always right" been Eddie's attitude.  Look, I used to be a server and of course the customer is wrong sometimes, but you have to leave them wanting to come back.  Unfortunately I won't be back and I won't recommend to my friends.
