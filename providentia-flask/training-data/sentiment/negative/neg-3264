Food was far too salty.  There was a salsa bar but they did not provide chips.  If you wanted chips you had to pay for them.  I was disappointed with the overall experience.  My friends were very dissatisfied with their food and overall a really poor experience.  We were really excited to eat here and we were really disappointed.  We ordered fajitas and two different kinds of enchiladas and all three of us did not enjoy the food.  Our bill was just under $100 for three people and my friend did complain to the owner.  He was kind and wanted to refund our money but also wasn't open to commentary on the food.  He basically said that this is how the food is made and its too bad that you don't like it.  We all eat authentic Mexican food regularly and I don't really know how anyone could enjoy the food.  It was truly disappointing.
