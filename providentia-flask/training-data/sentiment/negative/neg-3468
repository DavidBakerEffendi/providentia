Lunch stop here blew my budget and was a disappointment. Certainly I don't mind paying for good sushi but standard rainbow roll had very little fish and no personality. Hand roll of salmon skin had unrecognizable crumbs of fried something. Even ginger condiment was a small pile of half shavings. Edamame was not fresh. Prices inappropriate for quality & ambience; too many wooden fence panels indoors for me.

Restaurant was clean. Server provided entrees while talking on the phone.
