Formerly Cadillac Ranch, and not much has changed. Brisket pizza was satisfactory but thick sliced fresh jalapenos were a bit too much. Mahi mahi was very good, but somewhat small. Wait staff was average, and it goes down hill from there.  Music included F-bomb dropping rap, unacceptable for a place that claims to be a "family" place. Then a 18% Gratuity tacked on a party of 4 adults an 2 kids. Needless to say, I wont be going back, and made it known on the customer comment card.
