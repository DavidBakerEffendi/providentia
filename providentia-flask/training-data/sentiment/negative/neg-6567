I've tried two Rise & Shine locations and both times I've had issues.

Southern Highlands location - Once seated, it took close to more that 15 mins to get our water,  30 mins for the server to take our order and another hour to get our food. We've seen people get seated, eat and leave while we were seated. Totally unacceptable.  We spoke with the manager but did nothing about it.

Henderson Location - Thought I'd try this new location out. I ordered for pickup. Low and behold, I had a very long piece of hair in my food. We called and spoke with the manager and requested for a refund but we needed to go back to the location. Once at the location, the manager was no where to be found.  Got the refund from the host but WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.


I DO NOT RECOMMMEND GOING TO THIS PLACE.
THIS PLACE IS A JOKE. I HAVE HAD BETTER SERVICE AT DENNY'S.
