Stopped in for a bit of breakie, was forced to sit outside with my son.  (Manager said no kids allowed inside , but the menu stated it was family friendly, hmm)

Wait staff was pleasant and quick...  Food was under par.  If your there for beer and sports I'm sure it will fit the requirements.  Just not for anything else.
