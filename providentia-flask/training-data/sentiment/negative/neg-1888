The service made our experience an agonizing headache.

I sat down at our outdoor table before my husband came in with our son. From our young, inexperienced server, I ordered our two mimosas, a strawberry pomegranate juice in a kids cup, and a kids scrambled egg breakfast with sausage and hash browns. Once they came in, we settled in and enjoyed the open patio on the Sunday morning. The kids drink came out (no mimosas yet) and it was a very thick juice, so I diluted with some water and my son couldn't get enough of it! I then ordered eggs over medium with extra crispy bacon and my husband asked for the Incredible omelette with no mushroom and extra crispy hash browns. The server wrote everything down and even repeated a bit of it back to us.

This is where it started getting annoying. 
- Kid's breakfast came out with bacon. Was sent back for sausage.
- Had to ask for silverware.
- Asked for straws for our waters and an extra napkin, which was thrown on the table.
- Asked two extra times about the location of our mimosas.
- Hash browns were not crispy, as requested.
- (omelette actually had no mushrooms, so small victory)
- Bacon was soggy.

By the time we got to my bacon, I was pretty much through with this place, but my son had eggs, which are his favorite, so we weren't going anywhere. I sent back my plate for the chef to get my bacon to extra crispy and then.............................. it never came back. My husband didn't touch his gigantic plate of omelette (that thing's seriously huge. split that shit) because he's a gentleman who waits for everyone to get their meal. Our server uncomfortably sees I still don't have my plate and makes a beeline inside. We notice him continuing to help other tables, so we just wait. He sees our table again, stops and says he'll go check on my bacon. When he comes back out, he looks a little frantic, saying that my plate must have gone out to the wrong table. So I ask for the manager. 

The manager comes and asks us how our meal is. We explain that I don't have my meal and that my husband hasn't even tried his yet. We tell her about our wait for mimosas (which ended up coming out about when we got our food) and all other issues which led to this moment. Not saying anything to us, she turns her head and calls out to the server to begin asking him if this is true. She walks him inside. Uh, what? I thought this was going to be a conversation between us and you. I am but a human being - I need closure! And THEN you do your managerial thing in your professional way to a server who doesn't know what he's doing because this is a learning experience. But, no. When my husband walked up to her to ask what was going on, I chugged my mimosa and asked the server for our tab for only the mimosas and the kids meal. He tried to explain to me his actions in a very unprofessional way (it's really busy, it's Saturday, you didn't tell me you wanted mimosas, you never said the bacon needed to be extra crispy!) until he finally left, effectively making me very uncomfortable. When the the server finally came back out, he told us to "just go" and that he's getting chewed out by his manager now, so thanks. No, kid. Thank YOU for this experience. 

As we were gathering our things, the manager came back out and turned into the woman that I'd hoped she'd be from the get-go. Apologetic, understanding, and caring. She even handed my husband an envelope, saying she would really like us to come back and try them again. Maybe, he tersely replied.

When we got to the car, he opened the envelope. A $10 gift certificate. For wasting my time and a beautiful Sunday morning?? What a joke. We gave it to a waiting couple and will never ever come back.
