This place is closing down at the end of the month -so I'm just writing this as a word of caution in case anyone, curious like me wanted to experience this place for a last time to be part of kitsch history. JUST DON'T!!

Surprisingly, this place was a full house on a Friday night. I guess everyone heard the news and wanted to check it out.

I thought it'd be a fun outting to dine in a cheesy tropical polynesian themed restaurant, I had low expections but didn't think it was possible to sink this low.

Food was horrific. Greasy, lacking flavor and selection, decor was old, dusty, grimy carpets, dingy lighting, bathrooms made me nauseous.
Service was so slow - We ordered cocktails that never came while others who dined with us received their drinks after half an hour and they were diluted, disgusting. 
Basically just food coloring in water mixed with a little ice.

This is by far the worse restaurant I have ever dined at in my life- I have traveled extensively, been to third world countries, eaten at crummy shacks in the middle of nowhere and never witnessed something this bad.

At 14$ a person + tax, I felt seriously disappointed. What a waste.

Overall depressing - avoid at all cost!!
