Just left after having "lunch". Walk in, there is a putrid smell of sewer all over the restaurant. We were waiting on a prescription to be filled at Walgreens across the street, so options were limited. 

Guy taking the order acted like he was really put out that we were there. Bf and i ordered 3 items total: vegetable tempura, one avocado roll with cream cheese, and a chicken/beef lunch "special". $32.00. Seriously? 

While waiting i used the restroom which had an even WORSE sewer smell. Food arrived. Immediately a fruit fly flew into my soy sauce. Bf's lunch special was huge, mainly more salad than meat. My avocado roll consisted of 5 slices, so big in circumference that it couldn't be eaten in one bite, so the thing falls apart with each bite. Barely any rice, tons of avocado, and a speck of cream cheese. Veggie tempura barely had any breading, and veggies were still crunchy. Not at all cooked. 

Only one other table in the place, when they left, the same employee let the table sit dirty at least until we left. Needed a box and had to retrieve him from the back of the place where he was sitting at a table and ask him for one. His parting words were: "just leave the stuff on the table". Not coming back.
