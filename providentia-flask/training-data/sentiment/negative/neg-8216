I feel ripped off. I blindly ordered a carne asada burrito and I paid close to $10 no drink. I sat down feeling like I over paid trying to figure out why it was so much for a regular taco joint burrito. Since this place is on Rainbow maybe it's unicorn meat I thought but nope. The burrito is good however not $10 good. I will never go to this place again just because it's over priced.
