After going to other Subways in Henderson and Las Vegas, NV, they always provided mil/vet/police/sr discounts but not this location. I bought a 6" salad bowl that you don't get much in it with the price of $6.76, is pretty sad. The owner is David Bonbara and I was told he won't offer discounts to anyone and that's ashame after few heroes who worked hard deserves this discounted rates. It sounds like the owner doesn't want to give up his comfort in collecting more but only for himself and here we sacrifice our lives for his freedom!
