I don't know.

Well maybe it's that people don't get out much.

For me it doesn't have to be a fancy meal to be good.  Yet Bellagio uses the term "Gourmet".  So be it.

Don't be fooled by fancy terms like "prime rib" or "sushi" or even Graham Kerr's favorite - Gourmet.

If you are looking for a lot of mediocre nearly tasteless food head down to the Bellagio, get in line and strap on your feeding bad.  At least the Char Siu Pork and Noodle dishes are good.  But not worth $40 and a wasted opportunity to eat at another fine Vegas restaurant on a Saturday Night.

If you want food that tastes good you'd do better at Noodles, First or hell go down to main street station.  You will spend less and get better food.

Trust me.

I am sitting at the Buffet right now writing this review and my signal is gone.  Conspiracy?  Just like the thermite paint theory my friends.  They want to cover up the fact that I had a bad meal so they are blocking me.

Maybe if I arch my back and wave my hands like that commercial for the Aria Hotel.

What was that pop?  

OMG I've been hit...  glub glub glub
