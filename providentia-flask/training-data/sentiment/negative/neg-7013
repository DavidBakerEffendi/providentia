Oh how do I start this review?!!!! 

The restaurant itself (as in decor) is amazing... Cozy and comfy, but that's where it ends!

I walked in for my first time with a friend, and the service from the minute I was "kind of" greeted, was uncomfortable! The waiter was clueless about the menu, the so-called hostess was too busy talking and flirting with male waiters and the food was a JOKE! Ok I will say it, it was NASTY, lacked flavor ", was cold, and did I say lacked flavor?! I could be the only one star review because I'm not a lush who drinks my lunch or dinner, but this is not a place to come for any food or appetizer... The chef and the staff need a major makeover.
