I couldn't stand this place! I am actually very surprised other people gave it a good review. Aside from the service being very poor the food was nothing too exciting. I did like the spicy chicken and rice soup, however they brought me out the wrong soup the first time. I was also brought out the wrong drink too! 

My date ordered a salad which was not bad, but not very good. There was too much dressing and it made everything else in the salad very soggy. I had the sweet & sour chicken, but was not impressed at all. 

The food is not the worst, but I can get better Chinese food down the street from this restaurant. I do think the service was so bad that it did bring down the rating, I did get a laugh however because they seemed to mess up on everything we ordered like we were on a hidden camera show.
