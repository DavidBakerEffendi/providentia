Horrible service. Dan the manager should be working at McDonald's not at this place. Ordered a beer and decided not to stay because the place was filthy and the bartender looked like he never washed his hands in weeks. We decided to leave before the beer got there and the bar tender and dan followed us outside and pretty much yelled at us. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Not to mention the place was filthy.
