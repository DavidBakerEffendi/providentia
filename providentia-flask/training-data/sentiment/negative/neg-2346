I have been frequenting this place for about 10 years now.  It has in my opinion and experience fallen from what I once would have given it a 5 star a few years back but no more.  I thought maybe I had a bad day a few months ago and thought Id go again and give them another try.  I love Korean food, especially Kalbi in the dinner entree so this is what I orders for lunch...at $22 bucks its not cheap.  Kalbi is not a very tender cut to begin with because it is connective tissue but got this for lunch and the first three pieces were nothing but grizzle...which tells me it didnt get heated at a high enough temp or a bad cut of meat.  So I told the server to take it back and I ordered a Bulgogi in its place.  While waiting I knibbled on the little Kimchi dishes and rice.  When the entree was brought I asked if she could refill 2 or 3 of the Kimchi dishes and she said it would an extra cost...about a spoons full of vegetables.  So this kinda set me off and told her I have been coming there for 10 years and all...never charged an additional for replenishing the Kimchi dishes and I asked for the bill...paid the $18 plus dollars for three pieces of grizzle, a table spoons worth of rice and two teaspoons of cabbage...told them Id never be back.  I used to love this place.
