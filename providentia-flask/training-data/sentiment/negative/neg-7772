The food is HORRIBLE! We ordered our food and in less then 5 minutes we were served. 
 Burnt pancakes, breakfast potatoes were plain and hard, sausage had a bad flavor, bacon over cooked, toast was chewy. The entire meal tasted like it was out of a frozen breakfast meal box that was heated in a microwave. Hostess and waitress were nice.
The quality and size portions are not good but I guess we got what we paid for..... Cheap crap food .
