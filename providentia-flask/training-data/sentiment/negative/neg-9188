Stinky.


You're greeted with a dank smell when you walk in the door.  Like an old mop head or bar towel that's been festering in a bucket of old  water.   We looked at each and decided to give it try, hoping it doesn't stink in the seating area.   It did.  It was horrible.   Look, I know its industrial grade Italian and wasn't expecting anything spectacular, however, cleanliness is important to me.    

Once the server arrived we decided to leave, we explained to her that it was horrible stinky and she said we get that all the time!   She blamed it on the cheese that gets dropped on he floor 

We split, heading out the door and the hostess asked what's up and we explained and she said she'll let the manager know.


Oh yeah, last thing, this smell reminded us of Houlihans in the mills when it was open.  You were greeted with the same stank dank smell.



Not going back.
