Terrible service the SECOND we arrived. We were a party of 11, but the hostess said she was not able to assist us because it would be over an hour wait(although a few tables are available). We decided to split our party so the process can somewhat be faster. This hostess claimed that even for that party she "still CAN NOT" help us. HA don't even think about this spot if you're with a group of friends!
