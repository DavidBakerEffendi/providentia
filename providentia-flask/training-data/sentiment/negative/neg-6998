For starters, it took the hostess 2-3 min to greet us even after she saw us. We were sat at a dirty booth, so we switched to a new one. It took 15 min to have our order taken, and 20 min for me to receive my weak $9 cocktail. My food came out disgusting. How can you mess up chicken strips? Well, don't cook them for long enough and don't drain the oil off of them whatsoever, and that's exactly how. I told the waitress I didn't want them. She took them and said she'd show the manager. The manager never came over to apologize, and neither did the waitress. She even acted like I was being unreasonable. And she expected us to order dessert! Don't waste your money there....
