Was fairly unhappy. Service wasn't the best and they didn't really explain certain things to us when we asked, and came off fairly rude when we would ask certain questions about the menu.. One thing that stood out was it seems like they almost try to trick you into buying more that what is offered. One of our usual stops includes the Wonton in the dinner menu, this one they asked me what soup I would like with my meal, instead of asking if I would like one with it, which hints that it is included in the price. Nope.   Would most likely avoid this place again.
