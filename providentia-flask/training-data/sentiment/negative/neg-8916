Went here once. My husband and I got a night out without the kids. We didn't want to drive very far so I told my husband about this sports bar that opened up right up the street from us. So we dropped in for a beer to check it out. We were greeted by a lady who looked less than thrilled to see us as we sat down at the bar. The first words out of her mouth were, "the kitchen's closed, the bars closing soon, what do you want?" It was 8:30 on a Saturday night. Really??? First of all, chill out lady, put a smile on your face, and give us a beer. I had decided within 30 seconds of being there I would never be back. The pissed off bartender served us a beer while making me feel horrible for being there. Do they hate customers this much?? Or at least she did. Why would they have this miserable lady working at the bar on a saturday when they are trying to build a business. Bad move. Also want to share that the atmosphere made me feel like I was in a subway. Reminded me exactly of a subway restaurant. Did not feel like I was in a bar. One last thing...are they closed?? Haven't seen it open in a long time. Living so close I drive by at least once a day. I wouldn't be suprise if they didn't make it.
