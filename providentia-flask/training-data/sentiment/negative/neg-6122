Ok, brand new place, less than a mile from our place. We love capriotti's, and eat there quite often. We have also been to many locations around the city.
This particular location has one major flaw. The food is excellent at all locations, including this one.
Unfortunately, this location is the only one that puts WAYYYYY less meat on their sandwiches.
I can't say this for sure, but I would assume it's because number 1) it just opened and 2) therefore, they stick to exactly the recommended amount of meat and toppings.
So in the defense of this location, they are really not doing anything wrong.
I gave it one star however, because it's not just a slight difference, it's huge.
If I had to guess, it's probably around 60-70% of the amount the other locations put on the sandwiches.
It's enough for us to make the extra 3 Mile drive to go to the next nearest location.
You can decide for yourself, because like I said, it's still a great sandwich.
