I was told at door that you can only hit irons have to take woods and hybrids back to car.  Great job on designing a driving range that can't hold a shot over 200 yards.  Expensive place to begin with but way overpriced if you can only hit irons.  Been to one in Wooddale, IL.  Great concept just not in Scottsdale though.
