Misleading menu. We ordered a salad that says it has watermelon in it. Once I looked closer at the description it said watermelon radish. Not what I wanted at all. I even mentioned to the person taking the order how excited I was to order a salad with watermelon in it. I won't come back. The salad was 11.50 and was mostly lettuce with a few scattered beets and a tiny smear of goat cheese.
