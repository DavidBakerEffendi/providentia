I have been going here since day one and it use to be the best breakfast spot on Mill Ave in Tempe. It's sad to see such thriving business decline. The food is now served cold. The prices have been raised to not such a good value anymore. The pigeons/birds ____ all over the patio. You order food only to sit and watch 5-6 people that were behind you get theirs before you. The icing on the cake today, their POS system is down so they were turning business away. You mean to tell me you don't have a back up plan when your registers go down !?!? I know why do I keep going back ? Well honestly My Co-worker was in the same frat as the owner and I thought if I mentioned the decline to him it might get better. Pfffft they don't care. Today was it for me. To many other breakfast spots in the area now seek other options
