EXTREMELY rude on the phone. Steer clear if you want to be treated with any respect. She actually hung up on me after our few second "conversation". I didn't get a chance to have my question (which was simple and polite) answered. I phoned back and she again hung up on me. I promise I did nothing to deserve that treatment.
