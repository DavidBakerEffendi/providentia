The large pizza used to be $5.99 now they've gone to $8.49 and tried to get third party people like GrubHub to sell it now I hear they're closed Monday and Tuesday that's 30% of the week are they on the verge of going out of business?

You don't close up 2 days a week if you're doing well you simply hire more people
