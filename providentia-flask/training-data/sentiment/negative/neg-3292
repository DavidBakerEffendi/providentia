I have no idea why this restaurant won so many awards. It was a huge disappointment. Everything we ate was good, but nothing exceptional. And certainly nothing worth the price we paid. We tried the fois gras, blue cheese souffle, ceasar salad, rib-eye, pork loin (you get 2 slices of pork, but 1 was undercooked, the other was over-cooked). I have a sweet tooth, so I was hoping maybe at least the dessert would be good, but no, it was the worst part of the meal. I got the smores, and there was way too much marshmallow cream before I could even get to the chocolate. And I don't know what they did to that chocolate, but it wasn't sweet enough. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant. For the prices they charge, save your money & go eat somewhere else.
