I gave this place a 1 star because zero isn't an option. I have received poor service here on several occasions and didn't want to visit tonight but I was out voted by the rest of the family and didn't want to make a separate stop. I ordered the Tendercrisp. It was cold and hard, the breading was tough and dry. My husband ordered the BBQ Bacon Whopper. Laughable. The meat was the same temperature as the lettuce and about as thick as a piece of paper. I now have the family's backing that we will not return. Thank God.
