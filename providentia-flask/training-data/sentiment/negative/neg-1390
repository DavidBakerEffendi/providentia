1.  All the food taste salty 
2.  Service was bad, restaurant is dirty
3.  When there is no service and we only have 5 people, they included 15% service charge on our bill, I told him what is the service charge for? and I am not paying the 15% SC for no service....they just look at me and play dumb....
4.  Don't waste your money here, go to HK Star down the street, they have great lunch special and service is always excellent.
