Pizza is one of those things that if it's bad it's still pretty good. Unfortunately this is one of those times where I just was completely unsatisfied I've had better frozen pizza wait strike that I've had better dollar frozen pizzas. Ordered online using the pick up method because I was told I couldn't call in my order. The place is clean and bright and weld it nicely decorated was a long line of people waiting to get their pizzas. This is sort of like the McDonald's of pizza, do not believe the hype they have choices for different sauces I chose spicy no flavor whatsoever the crust was burnt around the edges as you can see from the photo it tastes just like it looks no flavor
