I was not impressed with this place. It seems to have gone the route of many other Las Vegas restaurants; large portions at large prices. I'm always amazed that people will excitedly say "the portions are huge! woohoo!" without taking into consideration that they just paid for two dinners worth of food that they couldn't possibly finish. French fries are no good the next day. What's the point of spending $18.95 on a hamburger and a pillowcase full of french fries that you can't finish and that isn't good the next day?

On top of this the service was terrible and I had to go to the bar to get a beer. The bartender gave me a bottle and a pint glass that still had two tablespoons of water left at the bottom.

Yeah.....no thanks.
