So after getting horrible service the first time around I told myself I wouldn'tcome back here until they can figure out how to get their stuff together. 

 So I lied and decided to come back here because it was on my way to work and I was hungry for a bagel and cream cheese.  I ended up getting my bagel to-go so I can chow it down at work.  After spreading the cream cheese on took a bite into it I tasted something awkward in my mouth.  I pulled it out and found about 2 inches of a piece of plastic in the bagel!!!!!  I ended up throwing it away and was starving the whole morning.  So I will definitely NOT come back here EVER again!!!  This place needs to close down and figure this 'restaurant' business before it opens to the public!
