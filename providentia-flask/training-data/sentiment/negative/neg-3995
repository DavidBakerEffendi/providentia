I've eaten sushi burritos from this place maybe around 10 times but today, I got food poisoning. It wasn't any other food because I ate a granola bar in the morning and the sushi burrito was all I ate before this review. I threw up absolutely everything after having diarrhea. After throwing up I feel so much better but I don't know what more will follow.
