I've literally never had a worse pizza in my life... the veggies were so dried out that they were actually chewy... like chewing bad jerky kinda chewy. Thinnest crust I've ever seen on a regular pizza. Both pizzas were supposed to be stuffed crust but were both hollow inside. We were quoted 30 minutes but it took over an hour. I've literally never had a good pizza from this location, but never anything this bad. We usually opt to drive to the rainbow location rather than order delivery from this one. They are literally always out of whatever the special pizza that's being advertised is and the quality is horrible. 
There are too many pizza options in this part of town to order from this location. We used to order pizza hut weekly before we moved to this house and now don't just because the Flamingo store is the only one we can order from.
Yay another long rant on Yelp. Not bashing pizza Hut, because it's become my favorite, but I won't order from this location again.
