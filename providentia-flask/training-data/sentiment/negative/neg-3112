After a good movie at near Harkins, we went to this location in shopville. I order the most basics of greek food, a "gyro". Now, you would think this corporation would at least get this right, no. The meat was dry and four pieces of what passes for tomatoes in america these days, were just awful. So its on to the humus and pita bread. I mean did they store the pita in a steamer? Two of the most basics, ruined and awful.
