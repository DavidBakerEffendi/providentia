I hate giving any place 1 star but I have to.

Tried 2 gelatos -- mango and salted caramel. The salted caramel had no sea salt at all and was too gooey and overly sweet. The mango was sour and did not really taste like mango. 

Given the $9 we paid for these 2 individual separate scoops, and how bad they were, I simply cannot give this a "eek! methinks not" which is what Yelp classifies as 1 star.
