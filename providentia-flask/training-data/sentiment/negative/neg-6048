If you're looking for a place to get a good salad, just keep walking past this place. I was in a hurry and wanted a chicken caesar salad so i stopped at this Fit for Life.  Asked for the salad and no croutons.  They made my salad i paid and was handed what looked like a child size salad for 9 bucks. The container is about the size of my hand.  HUGE RIP OFF.  Go to the grocery store and buy the salad bowl instead. The dressing was terrible and the serving of chicken tiny for the 3.00 add on.  They also use sub shredded lettuce. FAIL
