Wasn't worth how much you pay. Also, I had the salmon and it wasn't cooked properly and had stomach issues for the last 3 days! The waiter was new and he was actually really good. Too bad the restaurant wasn't up to par with the waiters service. The place also needs a bit of a makeover because it seems very outdated.
