I know this is one of few spots for a late night beer in Medina, and their prices are right...but just so you know ITS NOT WORTH IT.  For the following reasons:

1.) It smells like sewage, sat down at the bar, quite far from the bathrooms and had to move to the far side of the establishment because it smelled like straight up porta potty.

2.) The service is pretty often terrible, and I'm not sure the bartenders are of age (this is subjective of course, but someone should ID those girls)

3.) We came in on a weeknight, when it was pretty empty and put $5 in the jukebox to play some groovin' tunes (Lettuce, Hiatus Kaiyote).  Soon, we noticed they were being skipped about 10 seconds in and kindly asked the bartender what was up.  She responded, "Oh, I'm sorry...I thought that was on our radio, there wasn't any words...it sounded like elevator music so I skipped it  Another patron backed our music selection stated "I liked it, it's pretty funky".  We didn't get to hear our music, or get our money back.  Rude.

4.) If you went to Medina High School and prefer not to run into your classmates who might still live in town or visit for the holidays, avoid this place. 

I have a strong appreciation for dive bars, but usually its because they have great service and a fun atmosphere, this place is just sad.
