This was my second visit and I am very disappointed. The food took forever to come out today and it wasn't even busy. The quality was just ok today and since they are close I probably will come back to give them another try BUT not when I'm in a hurry like I was today. It took over 25 minutes for my burger.  Last time it was less then 10 minutes and they were packed!!! It hasn't been that long since they opened.... I'm wondering if the service will pick back up?  Cheese want even melted on my burger.  It was COLD!! What a huge difference from that first visit!! :( :( :(  the fries were soggy.... Burger was lukewarm.... Fried jalape√±os were greasy on my farm burner burger. Food (1/5) Sadly, I think McDonald's across the street would have been better. :(

People that came in after me got their food first? How is the cool??  And the kicker to the not so good experience was that I couldn't use the $5off for downloading their app. When I downloaded it.... It never said that there was a deadline on when I had to use that coupon by. So I couldn't use it and they didn't even apologize for that. It was just like oh well u gotta read the fine print... And I understand that's a mistake on my part BUT I think if there is a time limit that it should clearly be stated somewhere. :( and there should have been an apology at least.  My first visit, they touched my table numerous times to see how things were going.... Today all i got was the food drop off.  Service (1/5)

Very very disappointed since my last visit with them was so good. I hope they get back to where they were. If they keep going at this rate.... They are going to be losing customers. :(
