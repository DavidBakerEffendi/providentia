This place is so inconsistent. We had four two-for-one 33 oz beer specials, so we went there two different days. The first day, they gave us four 22 oz beers for free instead of giving us four 33 oz beers and making us pay for two. The second day, they told us that they weren't sure how the coupons worked, but that they would figure it out and make it work. Then, halfway through drinking our beers, they said the coupons don't work, but that they would give us one beer for free. Really, we only had to pay for one extra beer, but it was frustrating that they told us that we could use it and then told us we couldn't after we had already ordered. Service was also very slow, despite that only a quarter of the bar was full. They also had to comp an entire table near us because of bad service.
