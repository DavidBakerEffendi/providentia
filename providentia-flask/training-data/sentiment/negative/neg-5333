What happened to this place?  Have been going here for 25 years with great, consistent service and quality - over the last 4 months this place has gone down hill fast.  They reduced their entire menu by 90%, their service is slow and inconsistent and the quality of their food (especially their brown rice) has gone down hill.  They now "out source" their California rolls and they are now made with a disgusting "paste" like substance that is terrible, they are also now using poor quality seaweed that smells terrible.  The entire place needs a good cleaning and when people walk in they think it is closing.  Very sad for a place that was once very good.  I would eat here 2-3 times a week, now it may be 1-2 times a year if they don't focus on quality, service and overall appearance.
