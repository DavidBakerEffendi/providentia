Disappointed with the delivery. Ordered Honey Walnut Shrimp and it was placed in a to go container with a side salad with ranch dressing. By the time it got to my house the lettuce was hot and wilted and the ranch dressing had mixed all over the shrimp. It was pretty gross. Will not order from again.
