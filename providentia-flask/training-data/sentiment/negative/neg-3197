What a corrupt seating system. Came here for dim sum on Chinese new year and the restaurant was packed. While waiting, I noticed the only way to get a seat is to know someone who works at the restaurant or bribe the hostess. Taking a number means nothing at this restaurant because numbers never get called. Decided to leave after waiting almost two hours and complaining multiple times. Definitely will not be returning.
