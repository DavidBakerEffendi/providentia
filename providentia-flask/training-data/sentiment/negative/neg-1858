I drove past this place multiple times and had always wanted to try it, but sadlythere was much left to be desired.

the staff was nice, they explained the food well and were excited about the food. but the food was not as flavourful as i hoped and was a bit expensive for tacos.

the food took a while to come as well, despite there being no one in there besides us.

i had the chicken, which i thought would totally absorb all the flavours, but was a bit dry and did not have that much flavour. i had to keep putting that mild sauce that was on the table on pieces of my burrito to get some flavour.

the blackened fish tacos were a bit burnt too and there were only two pieces. again, not enough flavour.

the decor was nice, i like the coat hooks at the front! Apparently the patio has the sun shining onto it in the late afternoon, so beware of that depending what time you go.

i'll take a pass next time for food in the area. wasn't worth the money.
