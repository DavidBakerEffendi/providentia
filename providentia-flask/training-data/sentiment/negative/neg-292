Our family dined here this past Sunday and had a pretty disappointing experience.  There were 5 of us and each of us had something wrong or missing from our order.  

We were seated fairly quickly, but it took a bit for our server to come over and greet us.  We ordered beverages and by the time our server delivered them we were ready to order.  Food was delivered in an adequate amount of time, but that is the most positive thing I can say about it.  My soup salad combo didn't have the requested piece of garlic toast with it, my sister-in-law had asked for a small side of poutine fries with her kid's burger and was charged for a full size portion, my brother requested refill on his "bottomless" sweet potato fries and in the 45 minutes we were there was told multiple times they were "on the way" but none were ever delivered to the table, my niece's burger was just so-so and her bottomless fries refill were warm at best. My nephew ordered a chicken entree and it was not delivered with the rest of the food. It was clear by the food delivery person's face that the order had not even been keyed in.  When our waiter realized the error he didn't say sorry, he just said he stole one from someone else's order so it would be out fast (it wasn't, and how does that do anyone any good anyway because now 2 people don't' get their food on time?) and then left our table as quickly as he could.  Another server or maybe the manager (unsure of which because he never introduced himself) came over and said sorry and asked if we needed anything. We made another desperate request for sweet potato fries, but alas, we were again given the "they are on the way" spiel but never saw them.  

They did take my nephew's chicken entree off the bill without being asked.  But that was it.  There are plenty of good places in Champaign to get a good burger, so I'm not sure we will be back.
