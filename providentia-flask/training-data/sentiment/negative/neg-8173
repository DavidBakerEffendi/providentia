Nope!Nope!Nope! Turn around and RUN in the other direction! If you eat sushi often you'll know what to expect. This place was DIRTY I mean gross! There's sauce splattered on the Windows, sticky floors and table. We went on a Sunday after church, there where about 10 diners and I was amazed to see a FULL conveyor belt of sushi. My first though was ok? Maybe they're expecting a rush? After 2 rolls I was disgusted! The fish looked like a fruit roll up, was NOT fresh at all. It was room temp which was disturbing and scared me to death. I really tried to give it a chance thinking maybe I'm being a sushi snob...? No, my husband was looking at me like to took him to an undergroubd sushi place in  Mexico because the standards we not there. I'm still in shock. The waitress was rude and did not want to be there. My 2 yr old son got teriyaki chicken that came with a size of sweet pickles that looked like they'd been sitting on that place from a previous customer who didn't want them either. YUCK! We paid and got out of there as fast as we could hoping we did not get sick. Don't do it man! Cheap but NOT worth it. I'll pay the extra and go to Sakana as I usually do. I should have known better!
