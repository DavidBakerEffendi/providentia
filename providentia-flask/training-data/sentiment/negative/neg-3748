I should have walked out right after I walked in.  My gut was telling me to leave, but I didn't.... I stuck it out.  Big mistake.

We were the only ones in there at 1pm on a Saturday.. bad sign #1.  I ordered the 1lb of boiled shrimp, "Original" style with rice.  I didn't realize "Original" meant "no flavor and way overcooked".  They were so overcooked they were hard to peel and were served with a chipotle mayonnaise!!  Gross!  The rice was literally Asian rice, with a sprinkle of  "cajun seasoning" on top that tasted exactly like a bowl  of white Asian rice.

My partner had a Jambalaya thing, thickened with corn-starch and had overcooked shrimps as well.  

I would highly recommend avoiding this place.
