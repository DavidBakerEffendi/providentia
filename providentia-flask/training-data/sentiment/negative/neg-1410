Just went there about two hours ago. Lots of choices but the food is really just fruit and cream (which, why would you mix those two together) and lots of late night eating. I guess it's a thing people do, but not my kind of food.

I got #32, the jelly with red bean and coconut milk- cold. I didn't taste any coconut milk, very watered down and the chunks of jelly were inconsistent and way too big for that tiny spoon in the cup. I guess this quality is standard for this kind of food, but i'm not impressed. oh yes, and they forgot my order. I was waiting 15-20mins, before i had to follow up on the order. The waitress didn't seem too bothered or bubbly.

I really wanted to not tip at all because i was disappointed, but since the bill was not split, and my friends wanted to tip 15%, i paid $8 for that drink which i absolutely did not find it worth it. overall, not impressed with service or quality, and personally, i'm not coming back.
