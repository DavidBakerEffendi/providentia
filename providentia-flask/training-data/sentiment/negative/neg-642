I decided to try this place when I was in the area as the previous koryo locations that are now closed (Sherway gardens and Yonge/Dundas) always had big servings. 

If you were used to those, you'd be disappointed with this one as they staff try their best to put less food on your plate. Asking for extra servings on those sides will be met with a scowl. 

It's only a matter of time as nobody buys from this place. Good riddance in advance haha
