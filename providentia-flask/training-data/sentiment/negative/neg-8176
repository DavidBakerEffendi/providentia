Wow. Went in the store and never have we been treated so poorly. The woman was rude and downright unhelpful. If this place had the very last morsel of food on the face of the planet I still would NOT buy anything.
On top of that, shelves were bare and atmosphere was awful. Don't waste your time, there are much better places to get your British goods in the city with much friendlier owners/staff!
