We walked in and put our name in for two. The wait was about 20-30 minutes. We sat down to wait and the host sat four other parties who got there after us. When I asked her nicely about it she didn't know what to say. I told her we were going to leave she rudely said ok bye. This was our first experience and will be our last. I can understand that the place was busy and there may have been a miscommunication but there is no excuse for being rude!
