As a Hong Konger, living in Madison and being able to feel like being back home is at Hong Kong station. The food is really authentic and I always have a feeling that it's my parents cooking despite I am miles away. In a small city like Madison where I can find such authentic gem is almost unbelievable. The food worths a 5 star. However, the service was terrible. The ill-mannered, irrespecutful server made all kind of excuse to ask us to share a table when we already sat and ordered. Whereas, after we left that table, they did not ask the another ethnic group of the same number of persons who came later than us to share a table. Thanks for being so racist against us. I tried to talk to this server, and she walked passed me and ignored me. We do not want to receive this kind of treatment, no matter how good the food is. And I will never go back to this restaurant ever again.
