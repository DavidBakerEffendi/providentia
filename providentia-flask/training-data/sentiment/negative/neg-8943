Was there Saturday for UFC event- poor service from making us wait when there where open tables to the drinks that where very light and took forever to get. What's the deal with having prego servers? There was like 2 and another one behind the bar- I get they want to work as much as they can but come on. Been to this spot many many times and never had this experience. I give the food a 3 star-
