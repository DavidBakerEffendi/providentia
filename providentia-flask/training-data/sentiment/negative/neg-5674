Used to love it but their oyster is really bad. I could eat a lot of oysters, but I could barely eat their oyster because its not fresh. This is really important because people can get diarrhea from that and that was what happened to us. 

Constantly out of oysters and when they have it, they are not fresh. I couldn't eat it at the end because the oyster tasted really bad. I was ok that night, but my friend and family had diarrhea and they had to go toilet in and out all night. I felt bad for them.

$50 for a seafood buffet that has bad seafood. Bad choice
