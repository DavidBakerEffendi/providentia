Horrible... We went there a few months ago and the server was OK. The kitchen staff on the other hand was disgusting. I am sure no one wants to hear this but we ordered and our coffee cups were dirty, our utensils were dirty, and the food was late with hair in it. On top of that we did not order a side of green beans and they came soaked in a bowl of butter. I am sure any vegan would of got sick from that. 15 caliores for beans and they were soaked in 400 and freezing cold. Don't eat here. They gave my boyfriend his meal for free for the hair and made us pay for the rest, just a icky experience.
