Horrible experience.  Me and my wife waited 20min for the bus boy to bring us a glass of water on our first visit.  We got our food about an hour after we ordered it abd it was mediocre at best, cold small portions and not the correct items but at this point we didnt feel like waiting another hour for a remake.  But the manager came over and gave us a $20 gift card.  So we though maybe it was an off day since it was saturday and we would try it again on a weekday when it wouldn't be so busy since we live close by.  And it was ab exact repeat.  But this time when we asked to speak with the manager they said he wasn't in today.  How can a restaurant have no management. We walked out before we even ordered.  Maybe we'll give the gift certificates to our kids cause we will not be returning.
