Let me begin by saying that I am not picky about my food, I am very much like a compost bin for my family ...with the ability to eat any crap.

I went to this joint with my girlfriend and she ordered this spicy ramen, level 2/3. While I ordered the donburi except the waiter told me they no longer serve anything on that menu page (I wonder why they even gave that to me). So I had to choose a ramen. I picked a shoyu one instead.

When the ramen came, my dish was edible. Alright, salty and a little spicy (I asked for a tiny bit). Nothing really that special. But my girlfriend was having trouble eating her dish. Apparently it was too spicy, thou she was korean and she was accustomed to the nature of spicy foods. I decided to try one beansprout from her dish and I began to die. It felt like my entire mouth went on a trip to the boiling volcanos. I have high tolerances for spicy foods too (and I really enjoy it) except what was infront of us was not something that is edible for human beings. 

We asked the waiter what he could do since there is no way we could finish that bowl without causing damage to ourselves. He gave us another small bowl of soup but that didnt really help much. My girlfriend began to collect the dark red oils and place it all into one bowl until it was about a cup's worth of "hot sauce" collected in a separate bowl. Needless to say, this was a challenge for the both of us. 

I quickly finished my bowl and told her to take her noodles out and put it in my soup. That became a little better but after our meals, her mouth was swollen from the pain of the soup. I never had a meal in my life where I had to struggle so much. If african children were to eat this, they'd rather wait for their next meal. 



We ran over to mcD next door afterwards to recover by munching down on some ice cream. Thank god we survived. 

NEVER AGAIN!!
