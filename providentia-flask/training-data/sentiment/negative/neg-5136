I hate to be the first reviewer for Peacock and give a negative feedback. Exactly the reason why I held back from posting this for all these days!

We land at the restaurant at 5:30pm and the gates are closed. We stand outside for a few minutes, somebody peeps from inside, sees us and ignores. After waiting for a little longer, i call them to check if they were open. The gentleman on the other side tells me that they open at 5:30, when it's already 5:45. Anyway, after i mention that we were waiting out side, they take us in.

We order a Mysore Masala Dosa (nothing Mysore about it) and a plain Dosa. We know that we were a little early than they had expected, so we don't mind waiting. Finally, the dosas arrive but without sambhar. The sambhar was served after we had finished more than half of our dosa! 

Nothing great about the taste. 

Though, i have to mention that the setup was above my expectation. I'd clearly rate the ambience above that of Peacock's competitors in the area.

Oh! Did i tell you about the final nail on the coffin. A hair in my dosa!! They did Offer a fresh one but my appetite was murdered by the sight of that hair. We were never charged for that dosa. Courtesy!

Owner/management reading this, you need to get the spelling of 'Peacoc' right on your cash memo, unless of course, that's how you want to be known!
