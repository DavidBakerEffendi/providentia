So looking forward to the margaritas,
There were four in our party,we were seated.Then since we weren't having dinner  were asked to move to the bar,which we did,but noone ever came to take our orders,so we approached the bar tender who served up the worst gawd awful drinks and charged $15 each.yes they came in a mason jar,but weren't drinkable.stayed until the band was getting ready to start and left.Don't get me wrong I love country music and margaritas.
But the are really desperate to employ such unfriendly people,especially since it's obvious they didn't graduate from a mixology class....no tip,no recommendations,maybe toby should visit and see how he likes it.
