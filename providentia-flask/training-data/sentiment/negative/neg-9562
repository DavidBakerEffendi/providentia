Ordered a "Ripp'n" Chicken Platter with an iced tea, coleslaw, and mashed potatoes no gravy. Paid for everything. When I got home, in my bag I found the chicken with a biscuit, mashed potatoes with gravy and an extra thing of gravy. I don't like the gravy, which is why I order the potatoes without! And I was ripped off a whole regular sized side. The chicken was soft and not crunchy at all, and I swear the biscuit was doughy on the inside. Don't waste your money at this location, and if you do, never leave without checking your order.
