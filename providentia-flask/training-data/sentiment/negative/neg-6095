Has the health department ever visited this place. The bathrooms were hideous, the food was bland.  I was skeptical just walking in because the place was t very clean, but decided to give it a chance.  Staff was unfriendly, or just unhappy-- not sure. If I had used the restroom first I would never had tried the food.
