We stopped by to check out the new location and grab a quick bite. Upon entrance, the manager and a host were at the seating stand. They made eye contact, but no statement. No question of How are you? Or How many today? I got the conversation going by letting them know that we were looking for a table for two. The manager looked at me and just walked away from the stand. I can appreciate that sometimes they just want to let the host do their job, but at least a notion like "Enjoy your meal" would be nice, especially since he already stood there for a while. Next to host began to look over the seating chart, but made little to no eye contact from start, all the way to the table. The whole exchange just felt very cold and uninviting. She did let us know who our server would be. Being that there was only one male server in the whole place, it wasn't hard to figure out who we would expected to come over and say hello. Well the server walked past us, looking at our table 4 times with no introductions or getting drinks started. You could tell he was waiting to see if we were ready to order. We weren't ready to order because we were waiting for him to come over as we had questions on the menu. After sitting for roughly 8 to 10 minutes without any contact with our server, we decided to leave and go across the parking lot to Char. In a restaurant you expect to have a certain level of service. Not high expectations but at least some service. You know, like eye contact and people talking to you.
