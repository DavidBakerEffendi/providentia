I would give this place NO STARS if I could. Pretty much they bait and switched what I had reserved and stuck us in a double queen when i had booked and PAID for a king. They didn't give a sh*t and said its part of there policy that they cant guarantee a room type. Um well then why in the hell does my receipt say I'm getting a King and NOWHERE does its state you "policy" after multiple complaints I was given a pitaful 10% off! Really! The obviously do not care about customer service or repeat customers. The rooms was OK and the bathroom was SMALL. The worse hotel experience ever!
