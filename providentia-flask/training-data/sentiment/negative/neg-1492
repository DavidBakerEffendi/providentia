I should have listened to the yelp reviews that didn't like the place. The salad was fine, but it's served in a plastic bowl.  Kind of odd.  Dinner was on a normal plate.  I had eggplant, mistake.  The sauce is off--just doesn't taste right.  Tried the side of pasta they brought--same bad sauce,   Service wasn't very attentive.  Felt like they were assembly line employees.  Serve, clear, check leave.  Could be I lived in Italy and ate authentic Italian.  That said, I do love Rosals in Chicago.  Won't be going back.
