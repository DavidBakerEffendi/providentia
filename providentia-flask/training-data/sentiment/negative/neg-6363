I was so disappointed with my experience here tonight.  The appetizers might have been good if they were not served cold.  The melted cheese appetizer was just a floppy  mess.  The trout cake had an off flavor.

The schnitzel was pretty good but this one bright spot was overshadowed by continuous bad service.  Slow to take orders, slow to deliver orders, not clearing dirty plates and a sincere but clueless attitude about what needed to be done in the dining room.  Sweet but unprofessional.
