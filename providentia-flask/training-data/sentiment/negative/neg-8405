They charged me 50 cents more to use my credit card without telling me. I asked why did you charged ne 50 cents more? She said is the taxes. I told her you already charged me for taxes. Her manager came and said we charge you 50 cents if you use your card. I told them that is their fee and not mine. I work in banking and that's illegal. The merchant gets charge a fee to use a terminal and accept cards. She didn't say anything. Said well you pay it not us.  Whatever I'm not coming back to this scam. I hope they lose their business because I'm reporting this.
