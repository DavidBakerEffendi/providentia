We used to love Grazie. We used to frequent both locations when they had North Scottsdale too. Our last 3 visits -YES we gave em 3 shots after a truly unacceptable experience- the service has been atrocious and the food average at best. No one in the place and dirty tables, no one to greet you and when you are finally acknowledged, a grunt to take a table. Waited again over 15 minutes for anyone to even give us menus. I don't know where their lovely daughter Sam has gone but she needs to return and rescue this sinking ship fast.
