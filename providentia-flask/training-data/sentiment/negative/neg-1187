BUYER BEWARE, stingy, stingy, stingy
$9.50 for a burrito, that's unheard off, 
A burrito that has full of clusters of rice I mean a lot, tortilla you can taste the raw dough, for the quantity of sour cream and cold wacamole, and seven pieces of chewy meat, meat that you can see is medium well, our cook didn't mention options, so he slams the quesadilla into the heater with out asking for toppings, very bad service, this guy should be trained better, Sunday may 21st @ 11:00 am, stop giving me the stink eye, yes I'm writing this in your face, 
This is a Mexican restaurant sort off, so you will get Hispanic people, as I notice white people gets Better treatment than
Hispanic is that what I'm seeing here.???
What a awful experience, may be they just want to recover from the lettuce with Ecola, that's what prices are so high, 
FIRST AND LAST, we'll never ever to come back to any chipotle, will try Qdoba I think it will be better,
