If I could give zero stars thats what this location would get. First we pulled up to the door, the employee signaled us to the drive thru even though even though there was someone in there with him. Apparently unlike all the other locations, you cant go in to watch your food being made. And if all that wasn't bad enough, once I got my smoothie i went to take a drink, and i guess this location doesn't secure the lid to the cup either because it spilled all over me. This was really an awful experience.
