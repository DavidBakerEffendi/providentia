This is my $6 burger... where's the burger? Also, I asked for honey mustard as a sauce to dip my fries in. Wtf is with your employees at this location? Never have I had a bad experience with my food from when I first ate at a  Carl's Jr.  as a kid, to this day. This is the product your putting out. Would you be satisfied paying over $10 for this and the lazy service? Also, how has this location been around as long as it has with so many negative reviews? Making money on the mouths of the tasteless and drunk. Good job
