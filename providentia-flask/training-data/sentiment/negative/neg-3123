The only reason I'm giving one star is so the yelp can let me post but I would give the Silverton no stars !! 
My wife and I stayed at this hotel this past Wed all the way up till Saturday it was a horrible experience!!!
My wife has an aunt that is a cancer survivor which was humiliated and their buffet the Manager Ariana made a joke about my wife's aunt because she has one eye due too cancer apparently that is funny to her !!when we put in a complaint it was worst !! 
The manager of the hotel did not speak to us to address the problem.It felt as if they did not care. They sent the security Jimmy  to handle the situation and this security was harassing my wife to sign voluntarily forms of a complaint!!! Who does that ???
But that's not all when we checked out Saturday the same security accused my wife and I for vomiting on the sheets !!! In front of several people !!! It was embarassing and we were being falsely accused.
This was clearly another harassment stunt on the securitys behalf and the hotel/assistant manager, manager was in on it My wife and aunt were very humiliated and drained we went there to relax and for a vacation !!! I wouldnt wish this experience upon anyone for I am still dumbfounded.
