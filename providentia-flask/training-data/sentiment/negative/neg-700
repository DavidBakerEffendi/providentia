Used to come here for lunch .. it's was quick and good. Stopped by for quick dinner . Ordered 3 basic pulled pork sandwich platters .. took 35 min for them to bring our order .. food was cold .. I was so disappointed and since we were staving we just didn't have the energy to resolve it ... no management in house, just bunch of high school kids in kitchen ... we were promised a dessert on house for our long wait ... never saw it .. I usually never leave terrible reviews especially about my little towns joint .. but this is I had to post .. just so so disappointed. Food is bland and tasteless .. I wonder if management changed !!! But I sure won't be back to find out .
