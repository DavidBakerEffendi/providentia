Wow. What a disappointment. So 4 of us went for a business dinner. 2 bottles of wine, 3 starters, 3 sides ,4 entrees, 2 desserts and $400 later.... But really. I wouldn't have minded the price tag if the food was actually good. For starters we ordered the octopus; which was overcooked and tough, the oysters; good, and the crab souffl√©; rubbery. Sides; a Corn dish which was decent, portobello fries; also pretty good and kale... Way to salty, but cooked well. Entree; I had the scallops-way way way too salty. I seriously couldn't even eat it. Even the risotto was salty. My husband had the crab linguini and for $39 I expected way more crab in the dish. The restaurant itself has an amazing view and beautiful interior but the food is nothing to be desired.
