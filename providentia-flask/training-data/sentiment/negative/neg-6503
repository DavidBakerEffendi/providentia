I have been here four times before and few years ago - once for our anniversary and had good experience. Came here once again in 2015 dec - it has changed. Service is very poor. I came for three nights  with my wife and four year old. It was a spacious 1200 plus sq ft room with nice bathroom and extras. 

For every bad experience i am taking a star away in my review.. And its just first day into the stay!

1.It took 10 minutes to get a person on line to order dinner - and they dont have Kids menu! The reservation included breakfast- when called it took almost 7 mins hold to get a live person. 

2. The bed was bad that I almost hurt my back and neck by the morning. King bed is almost queen size in most of other luxury resorts

3. Electric car charging is not available at Valet... They asked me to goto Another resort to do charging! Really

4.asked for water and delivered  after almost 1 hour. Anything else you ask to the room service they say No very fast.. Asked for Foam bath and they said No..went and checked in the bathroom I found it was there in the shower.. They dont even care what they have- say no to any special request.
