Nothing worse then being given menus and the bartender just walks away with barely a hello as they were to busy with each other than taking an order. 

Waited ten minutes with no one ever gazing in my direction. I like casual but the hostess looked bored and put out. The bartenders seemed more interested in drinking the traps and chatting with each other than making any money. 

No real desire to go back and be bored myself waiting on a beer.
