first time at this location they told me it would be 5-10 minutes for a table at 430pm with over half the place open. Then they proceeded to sit the next two couples that walked right in and each time looked over at me. I left thinking what terrible service and I refused to eat here.

Two weeks later came back, even though I shouldn't have, sat at the bar, got the ore platter and honestly it wasn't very good. The Mac and cheese was good. The Asian bbq wings were also, but the tri tip, rotisserie chicken and shrimp were all just decent. I expected better. Same girl at the front was working as well and she completely pushed the bar again so I don't understand why they don't want people in the dining area. It's what I prefer but regardless, they will have their way as I won't be returning.
