Terrible! Dirty rooms! RUDE staff! 
It's beautiful on the outside and I've always loved the shops here. I was so excited to stay at the Venetian. From the moment the limo picked us up at the air port I was disappointed. The car wasn't near as nice as other cars from other hotels (the drive was very kind).
Check-I was easy enough, but the room was less than desirable. Staff was very rude and not accommodating. Literally EVERYTHING was a hassle and disappointment!!
