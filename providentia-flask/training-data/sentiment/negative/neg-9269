Where do I begin??? Reserved a TABLE for 5. They took us to booth. When I explained I asked for TABLE in reservations we were given a TABLE for 4. Waited forever for drinks. Cannot get refills on cranberry juice. 45 minutes and still no food. They have horrible customer service. Do not waste your money go to the Hub where you get excellent service and food. Do not waste time or money at this place
