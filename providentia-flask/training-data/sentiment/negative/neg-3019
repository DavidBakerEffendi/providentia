I love Texas Roadhouse... usually. Unfortunately this location desperately needs to get with the program. They've been open for nearly 6 months now so things should be running smoothly now. Since opening, I've probably visited 6 or 7 times. I've tried desperately to give them the benefit of doubt but I think we'll travel to the Stapley location. The issues are poor customer service, wrong orders, and over cooked meat.
