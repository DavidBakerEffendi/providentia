A blind folded sloth would be a better server than anyone at Blue 32. While getting upset with the poor service, a waitress had the audacity to use a tone with my clients that had flown in from Houston.  Could've gone to the store and cooked a meal by the time we got our drinks. 1 out 5 only because 0 is not an option.
