I wish I was able to say something positive.  My story...well on their actual website, I clicked the reserve button.  I was so happy to see that I was able to reserve on boxing day, my birthday.  So I reserved a table and received a confirmation number.  My husband and I got ready, took a cab ride and ended standing in the rain outside a closed restaurant. Thanks so much for nothing....well we ending running in the rain and had a great dinner at Vivoli.  Thanks Vivoli for a great dinner and beautiful dinning experience.
