An absolutely abomination and an insult to anyone who has ever patronized a restaurant on this planet. After waiting a fair amount of time for a table, we ordered drinks and food from what I would consider an extremely limited menu.

We allotted ourselves 90 minutes to eat and then walk 20 feet over to the hockey game, which anyone will tell you is probably more than enough time. Apparently, it is not enough time at this restaurant. After our drinks came, we didn't get a visit from the server, ever. But we watched as entire tables were sat and fed while we waited. I pulled the server over and requested an update, and she told us the food was almost ready. 15 more minutes, and we stood up and left. We had sat there 55 minutes with no food. And we ordered basic, what I would consider quick, fried bar food. We almost missed face off at the hockey game because this place sucked so much. 

The server chased after me and said not to worry and that they would take care of the drinks. Um, yes you will. Idiot.
