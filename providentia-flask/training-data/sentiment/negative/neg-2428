Nice atmosphere. Very nice presentation of the meal. Friendly staff. Food was awful at best. Very bland cardboard. We did have a party of 14, but seated at 6pm saw 1st pizza at 6:30 and the last pizza came out at 7:55. Other groups came at and left before we were even finished being served. Felt bad that others in my party had to wait to be served below par food. The staff did apologize and comp 3 pizza and offered a dessert.  Oh I forgot, when they brought out the kabob. It was raw. They forgot to cook it. Oops! Not a good experience. Will not recommend or return. To be clear. Wait staff were very kind and gracious. The problem is the kitchen.
