This is absolutely the most disgusting place I've been in!! There is trash everywhere, no one has swept or wiped down the tables in the 30 minutes I've been here. The toilet hasn't been cleaned in a VERY long time (there's a mildew ring around it..). Floors are disgusting as well. Ew ew ew!! Won't be coming here again!
