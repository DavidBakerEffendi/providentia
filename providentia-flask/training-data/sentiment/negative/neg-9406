This is a tough one. This restaurant is a lot of fun, has reasonable prices and very good food. 

Unfortunatley you can expect a wait of 1-2 hours seemingly anytime during the week, night or day. Even take-out usually takes over an hour!

I suppose that's evidence of the restaurant's overall quality, but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that I rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad, because they probably have the best wings I've ever tasted.
