This is one of the worst McD's I've been to in Vegas.  It's super slow and dirty.  If it wasn't close to my work, I wouldn't go here...in fact, if I do go to McDs, I will just opt to go one closer to home just to avoid this place. 

Also, the drive thru is horribly organized.  You're likely to get into a car accident if you try and use it.
