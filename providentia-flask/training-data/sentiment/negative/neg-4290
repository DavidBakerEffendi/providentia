We are always on the lookout for new delivery places for our lunchtime cravings. We were excited to see a café on beyondmenu.com, we were really looking to mix it up instead of having Chinese or Jimmy Johns yet again so we were willing to pay the ridiculous delivery fee of $3.00

I wish I could say we had a good experience, but that just wasn't the case.

The website said delivery times were 30-45 minutes so at 60 minutes I was calling to see where our food was, but no one answered my phone calls. Finally, our receptionist told me our food was here. I went to get it and she explained that it had been delivered 20 minutes before hand but they didn't have a name on the order so they had to leave, go look up the name, and then call her with it. This means our hot food was no longer hot. I am pretty sure the food would be excellent but my cold and congealed omelet didn't do it for me. 

Because there was an $18  minimum for delivery, we ordered a $3 side of potato salad to cover the difference between our meals. I wish I could tell you how that was, but it wasn't delivered and again when I tried to call there was no answer. 

So to recap the 1 star score: Over an hour to deliver, they don't bring the name of the order, cold food, missing food, no answer of the phone when there are issues. 

Maybe the BB stands for Bad Bad?

8/20: As an update someone did call from BB Café and talk about waiving a delivery (whatever that means) to make up for the bad experience, but the first impression with this one is sticking around. Had there only been one issue, maybe a second chance would be given, but I am not changing my mind on this one. It was too many issues.
