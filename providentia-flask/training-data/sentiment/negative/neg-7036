Very average food considering the price tag (~$35 a plate), very slow service - took almost an hour to get a meal for one prepared on a Sunday night in a half empty restaurant. The waiter was nice, when he was around, which he wasn't very often. There are really no redeeming qualities to this place, forgettable and overpriced. Can't see them being in business for very long.
