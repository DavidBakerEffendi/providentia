Very unaccommodating. We came in a semi large group and very unaccommodating seating us together. They would not let us move 2 tables together. This isn't some fancy restaurant where they have some elitist image to keep. It's your run of the mill, a dime a dozen cheap pho hole in the wall.
I'd give them a zero star rating if the app would let me.
