If you have 25 minutes to burn waiting for lunch to-go orders, this is the place for you! I ordered one of the simplest items on the menu (a vegetable salad) and I still waited over 25 minutes for my order...I'd probably still be waiting for it if I didn't flag someone down asking where the food was. About 8 people who arrived after me and were eating there got served before me. It's like they cared more about the dine-in customers more than the to-go orders. If that's the case, stick to what you're mediocre at and don't offer a to-go option.
