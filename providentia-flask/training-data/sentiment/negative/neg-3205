Top Golf is meant for drinking only.  It is not meant to practice golf.  This place is a total joke.  YOU CANNOT HIT YOUR DRIVER, FAIRWAY WOODS OR HYBRIDS.  You can only use your irons.  I bought a Groupon and no where does it say irons only.  Call the driving range and they tell you NOTHING ABOUT IRONS ONLY.  I guess some genius didn't figure out that if you are on the top floor some balls will fly over the net at the end.  You can tell this place is poorly run, step inside and you would be hard pressed to find anyone to answer your questions.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU STAY AWAY FROM THIS JOKE OF A GOLF OUTLET.  If you want to drink and wait for your drink, go right ahead.
