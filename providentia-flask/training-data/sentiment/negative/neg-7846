We've had way too many ups and downs with this place and after our last visit this past week, we will not return. Or problem is never really with the waitresses, more the kitchen.  While we were there, they were  surprisingly busy, but we didn't mind. When we ordered, we were told it may take a little longer than normal, fine. I ordered the California wrap with crispy chicken instead of grilled and my husband ordered a burger with potato salad instead of fries. About 35-40 minutes later, our food arrived. He had fries instead of potato salad, easy fix. Mine however was the completely wrong wrap, I received the oriental wrap or something like that. At that point I just told the waitress, but told her I wasn't going to wait another 30 minutes for food so I wouldn't send it back. There was SO much oriental sauce in the wrap that I couldn't eat more than a few bites of it, it was disgusting. After all of this, she only took off 10% ( which was a whole $0.98 off of my wrap). We never leave here satisfied, it's always more problems then not.
