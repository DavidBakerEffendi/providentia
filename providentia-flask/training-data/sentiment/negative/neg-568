Where is the habibiz (love) ? Only gets a star because that's the lowest I can offer it...writing this review to prevent other potential victims to a mediocre hookah joint. 

Review - when drake rapped" it's my birthday I can get high if i have to" he probably was high when he walked in here because the lights would have that effect but if you're walking here to expect some extra fun save your time ...cause it's a 1 star hookah joint to me. I can have a better session in my room than this average restaurant.

Staff- very late, too busy eating Shwarma & falafels  to help their customers...took 15 minutes just to get the guys attention.

Seating - no problem finding a seat, but getting into it is another habibiz..like chairs are so close together in order to sit in those Comfy sofa areas is you need to move the furniture first.

Music- I understand its suppose to have a middle eastern vibe...but stop playing tracks that all sound the same...promoting habibi habibi .. Like I understand.

Shisha experience - not great...using fruits such as oranges as flavour holders .. Creative but USELESS! I'll give them the Martha Stewart award for the fruitiest hookah set up. Also it came to a point where the whole apparatus was oozing blood like fluid...and that's when I realized its time to yalla habibi.

Washroom- only best part about this joint...cause I could take the nicest leak in peace

Price- reasonable 15$ but waste with the experience I had.
