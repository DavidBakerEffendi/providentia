This place staff needs more training, also they always mess up our order for the price of the food. They need to be better at counting how many pieces of chicken. We ordered a 12 piece and only got 8. Last time we ordered an extra side of plantanes and gave us a side of corn salad. Seriously?! Worse customer service too. They never answer the phone and their corporate never gets back to you either. Last time we are coming here.
