VEGANS AND VEGETARIANS BEWARE!! Spring rolls are my absolute favorite so the first time I went to Mr. Hunans I inquired to make sure they were vegan, as in didn't contain eggs in the wrapper. They said they did not, so I ordered a few and fell in love with them; honestly they're delicios.

I went in another time, ordered more spring rolls and went on my way.

The third time I went in I ordered a bunch of spring rolls to go and to my horror, the person working informed me that not only do they contain eggs but also SHRIMP PASTE. I was super disgusted; not only do I not eat any meat or animal products, but I despise all sea food. Admittedly, I couldn't taste the shrimp but knowing it is in there I cannot eat them any more.

Being in the service industry I understand that sometimes miscommunications occur, so I did not get mad at the guy at the counter, as it was not his fault but the person who has misinformed me before. My dietary restrictions are mearly preference, however restaurants need to take such seriously for people who have allergies, especially to shellfish. I explained this to the counter person and his response was that even though he has tried to tell other employees this, "it is a cultural thing and simply don't understand." That's no excuse at all; as a food establishment it is their responsibility to ensure food safety and preferences when required by certain guests.

Like I said, the food in my experience was tasty, however I was deceived into eating something I would never have by choice. If you don't have any dietary requirements or preferences I would say go ahead and try it, but just know they'll likely say anything to get you to by their food and you may have no idea whats in it.
