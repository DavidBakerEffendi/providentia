We were in town for a wedding and stopped in late on a Friday night for a slice. The employees were nice and helpful, and the pizza looked decent. The kids had cheese pizza, and I had one with meat- maybe called the Extreme?  Cut to two hours later, I have horrible food poisoning and 30 hours of misery. Unfortunately, I was so sick that I couldn't even attend the wedding we flew across the country for.  I wish I had read some of the Yelp reviews before we stopped in. Eat here at your own risk!
