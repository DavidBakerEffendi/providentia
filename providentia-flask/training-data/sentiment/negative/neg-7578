This is  a review a couple of months back. The food here is not fresh or tasty. It's the most lazy ass cooking there is. I order toasted thick bread with peanut butter and condense milk and they did not toast the bread they slap on the peanut butter and milk and the whole thing looks gross! Of course I return it telling them "how can I eat this? it's hard and cold!". If you have had this bread before you should know the milk on top should be a little burnt and crusty  almost looking like a cheese pizza and really Hot!. I think it was like $3.99 for that toast. I also got the mapo tofu, spelling might be wrong. The mince pork in mapo  tasted like nothing, it was very bland and smell funny. I would never return here again even if it's free! It's really nasty.
