This is by far the stingiest Chipotle of all time. I mean, they were giving portions like it came out of their own pockets. Tiny scoop of rice and tiny scoop of chicken. I get to the condiment section and asked for corn and lettuce. It was the smallest handful of lettuce ever. I also asked for sour cream. She gave me a massive scoop of sour cream, so my food was literally drenched in it, ugh. My food got cold instantly from all the sour cream. All the chicken was gone before the rest of the rice and vegetables. Probably the first and last time I'll be at this location. 

P.S. Hearing "Hi welcome" from the employees over and over for each guest walking in was a little annoying.
