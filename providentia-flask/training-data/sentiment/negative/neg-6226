I have never felt compelled to write a yelp review... HOWEVER. I just got back from Mooyah, I would love to tell you how my burger and fries tasted however I never got them. After 20 minutes of waiting for my food I finally went up to a manager today to ask if they had forgotten about my order. He said no, we are dealing with an online order. No apology, just kind of looked me in the face like "deal with it". I explained that I had to get back to work to which the manager told me to go to the register and ask for my money back at the front register then. I asked him if he was serious and was actually stunned that instead of fixing the problem he basically told me to F off and eat somewhere else. Another manager or owner guy saw i was upset and offered me a free burger on my way out. I literally have never been treated like this at a fast casual place before. I give a lot of grace to new restaurants but when its the manager acting like that then you have a problem from the top down. 

Can't say I am even going to use this coupon, there is no way the burgers are that good. I am not eating lunch today now and was late back to work.
