I tried the delivery service for the first time. I have never been inside this JJ location, but it's closest to my home so I ordered. My boyfriend made the order, which included a conversation about onions with Alyssa (I believe) that went something like this:

BF: (thinking he's just being funny & she'll understand) Can you make the Country Club extra country? And by extra country, I mean add onions? Haha.
Alyssa: So...you want extra onion?
BF: Oh...does it already come with onion on it?
Alyssa: No.
BF: Ok...well then put onion.
Alyssa: Extra onion?
BF: It doesn't come with onion already?
Alyssa: No.
BF: Ok...then just add onion...regular...not extra.

The $20 delivery of 2 sandwiches, one bag of chips, one cookie, and one drink arrived very promptly. Alyssa was the one who delivered it. BF joked & asked if the sandwich was extra country. She said she didn't know...she didn't make it.

We start eating. I take about 2-3 bites and realize I haven't tasted any onion. I open my sandwich...absolutely no onion. Good thing they had that big convo about it, huh?

I considered calling back to get it fixed but all the employees at Jimmy Johns stores seem to be high school kids that I have absolutely no doubt would spit in my food for complaining, especially 15 minutes prior to closing. I decided to give "Feedback" on the Jimmy Johns website instead. Using my smart phone, I wrote a small description, filled out my address, phone number, etc, etc... and finally hit "Submit". I got a message back that said "Bummer...could not submit. Error 404" or some crap. Bummer? Really??? 

This PLACE is a bummer. And the fact that I will not be eating there anymore...that's a bummer for them. And my sharing a crappy experience here on Yelp...yep...another bummer for them!
