We visited this Moe's yesterday around 3:30PM.  We had a 2 for 1 Burrito coupon and had seen Moe's on Under Cover Boss, so wanted to check it out.  When we walked in no one shouted "Welcome to Moes" like we had seen on TV.  As a matter of fact there was no one to be found, except for one customer eating at a table midway towards the rear of the restaurant.  We walked up and down the line a few times and checked out the food.  The meats were covered.  After about 5 minutes we decided to walk out.  Maybe I should have walked to the back to try and find someone to help us or but I didn't.  If business is that slow, put a bell on the door.  I won't be back.
