Taco Bell, Taco Bell, Taco hell how does your garden grow, with all the grease you serve in your food I just don't know!!  It seems taco bell through out my life goes through cycles of crapness to craptastic!  

So like 20 years ago, it was like you ordered taco bell you would get grease tacos with some lettuce and something that resembled cheese. 

Then like 10 years ago it was like "Yo Quiro Taco Bell" with that little annoying fucking Chihuahua which was OK Taco Bell was kind of hip and tasted craptastic, remember according to the movie Demolition Man with Sly all restaurants will eventually turn into Taco Bells...this thankfully will never happen. 

And once again Taco Bell is now crapness food that is similar  to Filberto's only good if you are somewhat drunk and nothing else is open. I told myself I would never go here again after gas prices got up to around 4 bucks and I went in to order two chicken soft taco supremes, and it was like 6 bucks for just the two of them, and I was like are you fn kidding me? They said they had to raise their prices due to the rising cost of fuel.

This is right about the time they came out with their value menu of you can get a tortilla filled with baby poop for 79 cents campaign, I recently made the mistake of hitting the drive thru one hungry drunk night and  remembered why I vowed never to go there again.

My check was like 10 bucks for what I think were 4 soft tacos and a large drink, they could have been something someone puked into a tortilla with some lettuce and some bile for that matter, I was sick for two days...literally.

 I will never go to this location again, except maybe to protest the poisoning of the people by a huge corporation...eat here at your own risk it could be your last meal.
