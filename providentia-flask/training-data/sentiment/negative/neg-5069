No longer offering any gluten free options says the manager today. 
A sushi place that can not do gluten free. This is a first for me. 
" you can order rice" is the quote I will end this review with. 
Bye Ru Sans, you once showed me a great gluten free meal, now you are not willing to accommodate. 

Best of luck in the future.
