I found this restaurant off of Yelp and was excited to try it out as it was a AYCA sushi place. Upon arrival there was two servers and one person making the sushi. One server appeared to be new as she was delivering food to the wrong tables and being told by the main server to clear tables. The restaurant was in no way full and the staff had a hard time keeping up with the incoming orders.

When ordering, the server wrote down your order on a pad and did not offer anything for you to write your own orders down. We didn't receive several of the items we wanted and ordered. We knew this as we kept a note open on our phone. 

The food was okay but the service was so slow. We waited about 10 minutes for each item to be delivered to our table. We also ordered veggie tempura and had to ask for it 4 times before they delivered it to us at the very end of our meal. The tempura was very low quality and a very small portion. It almost seemed like they didn't really care about the presentation.

The main server appeared very tired, not sociable and seemed to be angry when asking questions about the sushi.

I'm not a picky person but this had to be the worst sushi experience I've ever had. I go to Spring sushi from now on for AYCE due to the disappointing food, long wait times and not receiving the proper order. 

Save your money.
