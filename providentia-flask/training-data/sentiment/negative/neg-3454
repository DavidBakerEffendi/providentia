Needed to go to target and had never been so I thought I'd give it a try. Not even half full restaurant and most already had their food, and no one at the bar. I had to wait 30 minutes to get my one pita sandwich. Seriously considered just canceling my order a few times. Next time I feel like getting a pita I might as well go shopping for the ingredients, it's probably be faster.
