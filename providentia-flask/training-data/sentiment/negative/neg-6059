After a friend recommended Lou 's,  I had to try it. So here it is - The Good - The Bad - and,  The Ugly.
The Good.  Nice atmosphere. A throwback to years long gone. The waitresses are helpful,  and few are actually walking talking stereotypes of a stereotypical 50 's and 60's era diner. Opinionated older women that roll their eyes a lot when commenting on current events. Lot's of "color commentary ". I thought I'd stepped back in time,  I choose to put this in the "good " category,  but someone else might not dig it. The food portions are MASSIVE. Not necessarily flavorful - but humongous. The prices are more than fair,  the cost of a meal is *cheap *.
The Bad. AND The Ugly.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak. With O 'Brien potatoes,  scrambled eggs, and toast. With gravy.  The gravy was all but tasteless white goo. Pretty generic. Thank God for the salt & pepper. The chicken fried steak 's breading was like kevlar. The steak itself was done in most parts - very pink in other parts. All in All,  I would not go back. 
I wanted to like this place,  but I was disappointed.  The food was just not well prepared.
