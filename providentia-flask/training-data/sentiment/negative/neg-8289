READ THIS BECAUSE THIS IS ALL TRUE!!!!! When we went there an old lady was being are rude to us. We asked her where we could sit and she said " I'm right here maybe you could tell me!" We were shocked by how rude she was. Besides that, this guy brought us 5 little pieces of bread and it was 3 people at the table. We asked him for more and took him about 40 minutes to "cook it" when he brought the first piece of meat it was literally BLACK and when he cut it blood poured down of my plate. I was grossed out!!! After a couple minutes he brought more meat and it was BLACK again and as hard as a rock! Every meat I tried here it tasted worse than trash!!! We left there feeling sick and I'm NEVER going there EVER again. I RECOMMEND NOT to go there. Save your money unless you like to throw your money in the garbage can because this steakhouse is the same!
