Wish i could give no stars. Management is unprofessional, unsanitary, and rude.  Order a sandwich took a bite, order was wrong took food back spoke to manager Ana. Most disgusting health code violation. She took my sandwich which i had already bitten. Told staff open my sandwich put correct ingredients in, gave back bitten sandwich and began preparing other orders without switching gloves. Huge health code violation. DISGUSTING. Who knows how many orders she tainted with such disgusting habits. Poor Management all around.
