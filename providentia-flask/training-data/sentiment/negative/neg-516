My friends suggested we try this place for sushi. This is one of the worst sushi establishments I've ever been to. First the waitress sat us in the way back And she didn't even hand us a menu!! The only reason I knew was because the ppl beside us started ordering off menu items. 
Second the sushi did not look fresh the mayo was turning a different color and not many choices. Also on the conveyor belt were weird items like juice boxes and random stuff that looked like they took stuff out of the fridge...the only pro is that their plates are cheap. But I rather pay for higher quality & a better experience
