This place is terrible.  We had just arrived in Vegas and were thinking about eating at Joe's Stone Crab or Planet Hollywood.  Both were packed, but PJ Clarke's looked pretty empty.  We looked it up on Yelp and found that it had decent ratings so we decided to give it a try.  

Considering the place only had a few patrons and that it was mid week around 9pm, we thought we would get served immediately.  The hostess was nice and brought us to our table.  The atmosphere seemed OK, but the wait was ridiculous.  We made eye contact with 3 different waiters and smiled assuming they would come over and help us, but they just ignored us.  It looked deliberate as it seemed they were about to come over, but instead just kept talking.  We couldn't believe it.

Now I understand we weren't dressed formally, but I was with my wife and mom and we were just dressed casually (khakis and shirts, nothing too fancy, but nothing bizarre either).  It seemed as if we were being discriminated against for whatever reason as they didn't even greet us for 20 minutes.  We tried to get their attention, but they just kept pretending to ignore us.  In fact I'm not even sure if it was just us as the table next to us seemed to be getting pretty slow service as well.  It was really strange because we were the only two tables on that side of the establishment and there were only about 2 other tables occupied on the opposite side.  We continued to wait......and NOTHING!!!

We decided to get up and leave.  The hostess approached us and asked what happened and we told her that we were ignored and nobody approached us to take our order.  Again she was nice and tried to call one of them but even that took a while so we just walked out and went to Planet Hollywood (good meal and good service).

Regardless we are not going back to PJ Clarke's again and recommend that nobody else does either.
