I can't trust Yelp anymore, it's profound how this establishment received 4 stars for their disgusting dishes and glacial-paced service. We ordered scallops which were overcooked and served with this bland fried rice cake. Next was the brown butter gnocchi which tasted almost bland with a hint of bathroom freshener and had the texture of a semi-softened laffytaffy with a crunch in the beginning. The truffle fries were decent, nothing impressive. Tasted like store bought frozen fries. The spaghetti aglio e olio tasted like a cardboard with a hint of garlic. The rice au gratin with chicken tasted like trash. Disgusting. Honestly, I would've been better off making myself some pasta roni and rice a roni. Super slow service, there were barely any people there. If I could give it negative stars I would. I don't know what's wrong with all of your tastebuds lol
