We came here for lunch and though service was great, food was not.

Both Earl and I got the sashimi lunch special which comes with 6 slices of assorted sashimi, a choice of spicy salmon, yellowtail, or tuna roll, soup and salad ($12.95 each)

-The 6 slices of sashimi: thinly sliced and poorly cut.  Doesn't even look and taste like sashimi grade.
-Earl got the spicy salmon and I got the spicy yellowtail roll.  Both rolls taste the same, except for the rice that covered the rolls.  Why? Because the rice that covered the spicy salmon tasted SPOILED!  It was Earl's pick so he didn't want to escalate the issue.  I would have.
-Soup: standard miso soup
-Salad: at least there were no wilted iceberg lettuce.

Needless to say, I won't be returning.
