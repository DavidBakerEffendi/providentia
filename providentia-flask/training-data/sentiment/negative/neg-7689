Really disappointed with this place. The first time I tried it I liked it a lot (not loved) and I decided to come back.  The food was good but it was never hot or tasted fresh. After a few months I decided to go back today. The rice and beans looked and tasted old! I get the feeling that the side of rice and beans are preserved and in their little plates waiting to be ordered. They definitely didn't taste fresh and they were cold. I also ordered a Mulita which was also cold. The meat didn't taste good and the cheese was HORRIBLE! You know cheese is cheap and not good when it is transparent. At one point I even gagged. The sauces from the sauce bar even tasted different. This place is extremely expensive and can not provide quality food. I have given them my 5th and final chance but best of luck to you because you won't get any more of my business.
