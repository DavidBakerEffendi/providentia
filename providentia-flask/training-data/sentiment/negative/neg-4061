I literally wish I could give this place zero stars. Actually I wish I could give this place -10 stars. This was some of the worst service I have ever had. The food was mediocre at best and that is being generous.

Spoke to a female manager and she showed no remorse for the horrible dining experience that I just had. I am moving very close by and there is no chance I will ever be back. I will tell all of my friends to avoid this place and if I decide I want a burger I would rather drive 100 miles. Thanks for nothing.
