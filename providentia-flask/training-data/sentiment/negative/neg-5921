Do Not Come Here.The Food Is Nasty.The Lunch Menu Doesnt Specify  That It is Only During The Week,If You Buy The Groupon You CANNOT Use It For The Lunch Special Even Though It Doesnt State That ANYWHERE.So Beware Of That If You Are Crazy Enough To Come Here.The Pad Thai Tastes Like Sugar,The Waitress Was Dressed In Sweatpants And A T-Shirt,Unprofessional.I Cant Believe We Wasted Our Money.Mcdonalds Has Better Food. Krung Siam Is A Much Better Thai Restaurant,The Service Is Good And The Food Is Stellar.

I Attched A Picture Of My Food AFTER I Finished Eating.It Was So Sweet And Disgusting That I Couldnt Eat It.
