Went into Tap Haus for breakfast on 12/29/13 to check it out since we had never gone in there before. My experience was not pleasant. I ordered biscuits and grave and a side of eggs over easy. You would think that the time it would normally take to prepare such a meal that it would not take very long. Actually it was just the opposite, it took approximately 20-25 minutes. When I received my food the eggs were stone cold and the biscuits were so hard that I could not put my fork though it. The waitress was really nice about and took it off my tab. What I found very disturbing was when we were leaving the response from the woman that appeared to be the manager. I told her about it and her response was, "we are aware of the issues with our breakfast." I was obviously stunned. The only thing I can say it unless you are drinking do not order any food.
