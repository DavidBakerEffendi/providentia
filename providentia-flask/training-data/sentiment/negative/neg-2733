One of the worst experience I have ever had in any restaurant in Canada. I went there to spend some quality time with family after having a very busy day in office. I was served everything altogether including starters, dinners and drinks in spite of telling them let me have starters and drink first. I was told that kitchen was fast enough to get everything cooked altogether. After the escalation to manager. They took dinner back and promised to serve it fresh when I want. However, they kept me waiting for the dinner and never served even after reminding the server. Finally, we asked her to pack the dinner and get us check. This was my biggest mistake to go there when I had an option of Montana's or Moxie's in the same location.
