So it starts like this. I walk in and see two counters with people standing at them. The first has a girl standing there wiping down a menu. She looks up and doesn't say anything. I ask if we can be seated and she still says absolutely nothing. I walk over to the other counter and stand in front of the gentleman at that counter. He stares at me, doesn't greet me, and asks, "do you want to eat?" Well, of course I do. 

He walks passed the first of multiple open tables. He stops at the first. Shakes his head and keeps moving, goes do a second, stops, and then continues. At this point I'm really confused. It is obvious by the hosts body language he doesn't want to be there and could give two shits about his job. 

After passing the third table he balks at that and places me and my son in the furthest corner table possible. He throws two menus down and I ask if he has a kids menu. No smile, no emotion, just pretty much turns and walks away. I waited about 7 or 8 minutes and he never returned. I walked to the front to find an employee but I couldn't find anyone anywhere. No joke! The same female stood there and I asked if he worked here. She looked up at me and then put her head down and totally ignored me. I was miffed but I figured Id stick it out. I walked back without the menu.

A server walked by us. Ignored us again. After about 10 minutes someone came out with waters. Let me preface this by saying there was approximately 15 people in the restaurant at this time. I asked for a kids menu again and this server finally spoke up and said they are making copies of one.  

Eventually service came and we were able to order. I was l, well, pretty underwhelmed with the food. The absolutely horrible welcome and service left a sour taste which wasn't helped by average food. It was very obvious why it was dead at 6pm in downtown Scottsdale. If they ever want to survive they need to do a 180 degree turn. My recommendation would be to walk around the corner to The Mission.
