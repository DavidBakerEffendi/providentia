I enjoy going to the location on Priest since it's a little more convenient for me, but tonight I went to this one since the wait was going to be a heck of a lot shorter. The sushi selection was the same as the Priest location, which was nice, but man was the service awful. We got seated immediately and got our waters relatively quickly but after that, it all went downhill. I think we were there for a little over an hour and someone came by once to check up, but we waited and waited for our check. We were clearly done - napkins on plates, looking at the time, glancing around - and all of the waitresses looked at us at one point or another but chose not to approach us. It took about twenty minutes and flagging someone down to finally get our check. The girl that helped us was sour, to say the least. Once she took our credit cards, she brought the checks to the front counter and LEFT OUR CARDS THERE while she went into the back. About a minute later, she came back out chewing something, so I can only assume that she left my debit card on the counter to go go the back and eat. How long does it take to run a card?
