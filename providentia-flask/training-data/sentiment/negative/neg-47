My first time to a Steak 'n Shake will not probably be my last the food was not the greatest it's like anything you can cook at home. Oh the food was decent warm the female server refused to move us where it was less noisy she placed my party and I right in front of the milkshake area. Where it was hard to carry on a conversation..
