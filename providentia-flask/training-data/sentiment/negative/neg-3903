There should be a way to leave no stars.....or negative stars....this is the messiest and most disorganized Chipotle I have ever been to. Had this been my first it would have been my last. The people serving are in the wrong business as well. Most of them should be on the streets hustling 3 card molly. It.is filthy throughout and the service...well. i am so seeking to say somethi.g nice but i should have known something was afoot when i walked in an doth my date and I smelled what was obviously a burt smell. Well be the ever positive persone i am i want to try it especially when i saw that the chorizo was back...my bad thats what was burning. Oh word to the manag3when you finish with firering the entire staff teach the new ones that the rice is the cheapest ingredients you use. So you should probably use the right amount. This will give the apearence of quality covering the obvious. Good luck
