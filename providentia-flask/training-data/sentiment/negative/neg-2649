First off this breaks my heart, but I'm finally fed up with this location...... I used to order weekly, and I would always ask for extra sauce for the diablo, and they would literally never give it too me.. sometimes it would have less sauce then a regular portion. The last straw was asking for el diablo chicken and then giving me shrimp... what if I was allergic....  Finally I decided to call tonight and tell them about the problems, and they didn't give two shits to what I said. I then proceeded to order; I get their and he girls super rude working the counter and didn't apologize for any of their mistakes.... I payed and left. But I will never go to any location ever again.
