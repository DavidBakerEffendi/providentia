Prices here are average. I ordered a Vietnamese Coffee and Fresh Spring Rolls with shrimp and pork. As much as I was looking forward to my lunchtime snack I was left disappointed. The spring rolls were made with iceberg lettuce? And served with hoisin sauce?? Okay- I know I'm Caucasian but I grew up in Little Saigon and know hoisin sprinkled with peanuts is an insult of a dipping sauce for spring rolls. I had ordered to go so by the time I got my box open there was no way to turn around without being late to my doctor's appointment. 
The spring rolls were subpar and my coffee!! Oh, my coffee. It would have been good if the almost $3 I spent had actually filled my cup... It was ALL ice. I saw the girl behind the counter mixing a small glass cup of coffee to the side but thought it was for herself- NOT my order. There was no way that small cup would have filled my cup. My coffee cup was not full of anything but ice and I got maybe 5 small sips from the whole thing. The rest was sadly big chucky ice cubes that needed to melt in order to quench my thirst at that point. Did I mention there was so much ice packed in the cup my straw broke? I'm really sad because I usually don't try to write bad reviews but this place made me regret trying a new Vietnamese joint. Who messes up spring rolls and coffee?! Hopefully this was just a fluke and others have better experiences but I won't be coming back. I know what I like and this place isn't it.
