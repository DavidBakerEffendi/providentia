Jack and the box, one of my favorite places to eat. Up 
Till now. Two bad experience with the same thing. 
French fries, curly fries. The first time went to the drive thru, second time, I decided I would go in side. 
Thinking I would get fresh fries. But no, wait !! 
Served from the same manager.
I called, made a complaint. They said they would 
Talk to him about it. I go back same manager, 
Same bad service. So I take the food back ask for 
A refund. I asked him would he eat these fries. 
He looked at them and said no. He than said 
Sorry. Given my money back. Then he says
You can have soda. I said no thanks !! I really wanted to 
Eat some jack and the box. That day, I had to settle 
For (Burger King). But got fresh fries $$
