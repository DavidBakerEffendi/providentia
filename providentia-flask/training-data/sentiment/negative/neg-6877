I will not be back, nor would not recommend this place to anyone.  I took my brother here 16th birthday, thinking he would get a kick out of the place.  I understand that you are supposed to get a funny dining experience but I still expect to get napkins, silverware and plates (hello, how am I supposed to eat my food?).  The waiter walked away before I could ask him for any of these things. I think our waiter was more interested in the game that was on TV.  We never saw him till we asked for the bill. 

The food was awful and dry.
