This place is supposed to be open 24 hours correcct?  Well I barely can get in the door good and I was told that they were closed!  What do you mean closed? So didn't get me any breakfast this morning and allotted for that time to stop and get some there and didn't have time to go another place.  I went to another one by my house yesterday and they told me they were closed also!   

What gives?  What kind of  24 hour place closes in the morning for whatever reason? Very extremely disappointed!!!!
