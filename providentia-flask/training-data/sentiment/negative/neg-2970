I would like to start out by saying, I am not a picky person at all! I will eat just about anything as most times I have no choice:) I Ordered to go through Postmates... It was awful! The tomatoes on my wedge salad were literally mush because they were so old, I could eat any of the salad because I was afraid to get sick. Gross! The steak was ok but I couldn't eat that either because of the tiny, cheap plastic utensils, the kind you would probably get from a gas station. I did go down to the lobby of my hotel and get 'real' plastic utensils, the food was cold by then. Thumbs down
