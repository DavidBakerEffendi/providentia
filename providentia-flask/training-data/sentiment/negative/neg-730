Drove out of my way to come here tonight (because they have bomb veggie burgers) only to find out they are out of FRIES. wtf?! What kind of burger place runs out of fries? Also, would have been nice if the girl at the register informed us of that right off the bat instead of letring us go into great detail ordering our burgers. So disappointed.
