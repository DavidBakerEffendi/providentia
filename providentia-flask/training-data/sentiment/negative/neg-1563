I don't usually make a point to yelp fast food places. But this burger Kings bathroom smells like a gas station. I just don't even understand. How can ur bathroom smell so bad that it hits u when u walk in the door. Like shit smells stronger than the food..... like how?  How? How can ur bathroom smell so damn bad that now not only do I not want fries, but I'm not even hungry. I'm just pissed. They could freebreeze or something. Maybe get some stickies. Possible a fan. Or just freakin mop. I'm so pissed.
