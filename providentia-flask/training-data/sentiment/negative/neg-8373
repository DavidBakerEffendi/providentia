HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE..DID I SAY IT WAS HORRIBLE.. my boyfriend and I read that this place was voted best breakfast in vegas by Seven magazine this week. I have tried the location and was unimpressed..i would not say it was the best breakfast but not horrible..I come from san francisco where mom and pop places flourish and do breakfast like an artform..I have found that the Black Bear Diner does the best comfort food breakfast in Las vegas in the 3yrs i have been dining here so i was excited to have a new breakfast place that was featured on restaurant impossible now have a location literally behind my house on jones and warm springs..we decided as a family to try this place out this morning hoping it lived up to the reviews in Seven..since the spring mountain location was nothing to brag about..now for me i could care less about ambiance and decor of a restaurant or if its packed..i will eat on the ground if the food is good..hence my monthly trips to the fuku burger truck!!.. with that said..we got up early antcipating this amazing chicken fried stk and red velvet pancakes..instead we got a gamey hamburger that is dip and deep fried smothered in what tasted like canned cream of mushroom soup..dried potatoes..in fact that tasted old like the potatoes had been sitting in a card board box for a long time..the eggs were okay..scrambled a little raw for my taste but my daughter and boyfriend seemed to like them..the red velvet pancakes were dry and burnt a bit..but when smothered with butter and a cup of maple syrup they softened up and were edible..not good but edible..i was soo mad and disappointed..im not sure if the people at Seven have faulty taste buds or if they got a kick back for a good review..but there is no way either location deserves best breakfast in vegas..i wish i could give negative stars..i wil NEVER GO BACK..
The service was what would be expected in a run down bar location..if the food was better this place has potential but my first and 2nd impression of this business is awful..so no more horrible breakfasts for me!!!
