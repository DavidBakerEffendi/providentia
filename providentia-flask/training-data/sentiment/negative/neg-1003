ZERO stars! Absolutely the worst place I've ever been to for sushi!!! Terrible service, "forgot" items I've ordered (it's written on a damn sheet, you can't forget), terrible food quality, dingy place, etc. I only tipped $1 (shouldn't have paid for the meal at all) and they got all pissed off that I was cheap. HA!

Avoid at all costs!
