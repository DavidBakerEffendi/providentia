I ordered through Amazon Restaurants. They gave my driver the wrong order. They called me 2 minutes before my driver arrived to let me know they gave the driver the wrong order. Then they just cancelled my order Instead of fixing it after I waited an hour. There was no apparent attempt to rectify their mistake and I am left starving.
