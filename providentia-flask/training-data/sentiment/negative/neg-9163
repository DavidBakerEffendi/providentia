Arrived 10 min after they had opened one day in -30 weather. We were not the first customers as there was someone there already. Upon walking in, three employees stood at the counter staring at us as if we had walked naked into their living room. So awkward. No greeting, no smile, all three just stared. 

Once we got settled we went back to the counter to order - they didn't have boba ready. At a boba shop. Needless to say, it was pretty disappointing experience.
