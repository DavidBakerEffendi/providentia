If I could give 0 I would. Very poor customer service. We tried to give this place our business, but they weren't interested.  We watched them turn away a group of 3 customers because it was 4 minutes before 10a.m. (when they open). We tried be be considerate, and gave them until 10:05 to open the doors, they just look at us. So we turned around and went to a fantastic place, called burger shop, on 35th ave and thomas.
