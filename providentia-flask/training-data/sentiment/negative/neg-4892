This is far the worst service I ever had. I was in the drive thru for ten mins before I even reach the box to take my order. The lady who took my "order" she was extremely rude. When I pulled up to the first window to pay for my order, I had ask if I could speak to the manger she told me to pull up to the second window. I told her that she had horrible customer service that she needs to work on it, I was trying to explain to her that I understand how stressful this could be because I'm a manger at jack in the box, before I could finish she said " you could call customer service line " I ask for her name and her name is Lupe. Well when I pulled up to the second window I ask the lady there if I could speak to the manger she said yeah, well a few minutes the lady came to the window and told me that the manger was busy. I told her that was fine, well as she told me " are you gonna order anything?" I told her yes, I already did, she said she didn't see anything on the screen, so I ask her if she could take my order she said no because I was holding up the line, I told her that's not my fault. Well the girl told me to leave her drive thru window and get back in line. I told her are you  serious and she rolled her eyes and said yes. This was far the worst. I understand people have bad days but come on! If I could I would give this location a negative star or rating. This happened on 6:20pm Sunday Jan 29. Highly disappointed.
