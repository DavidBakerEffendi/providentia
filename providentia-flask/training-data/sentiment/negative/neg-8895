Was lead to believe this was a new and bright star for restaurant row, but good marketing does not equal quality food and or service. They need to send their wait staff back to basic training 101 or take hints from the Olive Garden corporate staff for training guidelines. The wait staffers were hardly pushed to the limit, six tables in a sitting area for 16 tables. The bright spot was the pork belly, delicious on its own! The French press coffee was pure light colored mud, and had to be taken back once and not consumed the second time, tres leeches cake was also a hit, but again it was tough to makeup for the "CHICKA" like wait staff, and that's not a put-down on kids, in fact my kids have and do a far better job in dining etiquette than these wannabes staff members did. Time for the management crew to do a review and correct the glaring and apparent short-comings. Unfortunately we were not the only patrons (Saturday night) that came away disappointed.
