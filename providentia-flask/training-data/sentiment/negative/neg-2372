Terrible experience at the restaurant!! Will not be returning here!! I will recognize that it is a holiday weekend, however...they should plan on having enough staff to take care of their customers. My daughter has food allergies and the server Jennifer was not empathetic nor did she try and be accommodating. She was on the verge of being rude. She was not attentive at all. Terrible service and they insisted on charging an 18% automatic gratuity due to the size of our group (9 people). I don't appreciate paying for piss poor service. 
As I stated before, I will NEVER return to sugar factory.
