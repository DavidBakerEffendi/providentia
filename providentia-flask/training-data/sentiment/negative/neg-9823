I was looking forward to a nice lunch while visiting Mapleside Farms, especially since the new owners took over, but I was wrong. I should have listened to the other Yelpers. The view although pretty, was hard to concentrate because the dining area was infiltrated with bees and flys. Not good. Then the soup I had was cold, and just plain awful, it tasted like baby food, I post the picture of it so take a look. 

Our meals were cold, hard to cut and just not tasty. It's not like they were busy either, it was only like 11:40am-12pm. Just not a good restaurant. The prices were okay but still for how bland everything tasted, it wasn't worth it. 

Sorry Melrose, the view is the only thing worth going for at Mapleside
