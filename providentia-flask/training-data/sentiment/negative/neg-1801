I went to the Winter Wonderland to skate, but the ice was fake, so I couldn't skate on that thing. I had to walk on the rink. I totally didn't expect to have that kind of experience as they advertised that there is an 'ICE' RINK. They didn't say it's fake. Thus my boyfriend wanted to talk with a manager, but the Mexican guy was so rude that he didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. He kept saying that he cannot understand my boyfriend, even though my boyfriend is speaking in proper English. I don't know how he got the manager position with that attitude and disability to have conversation with customers. Hopefully nobody goes to the event and wastes money. It was such an unpleasant experience. It also ruined my view about Silverton. It will be my last time to go to Silverton nor any other event will be held at the casino.
