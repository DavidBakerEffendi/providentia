I eat pizza hut all the time me and my kids. Every single 1 of us is sick and is fighting for the bathroom. There's a sanitary problem indeed my pizza had a burnt pepper on the bottoms as if it was from another order. I'll be making a call about this. This has to be fixed. Would hare for any one else to get sick
