The food is dreadful.  Its greasy, dried out, bland and oil laden.  We were even lucky enough to get a taco with a long black hair baked into the shell.  I think people want to truly love this place because its a landmark and has been around for so long, but honestly - it's just plain bad.  Beans with the dried crusting edges, watered down salsa, cheese crisp that you have to mop the oil off of, enchilada sauce congealing with the oil slick sheen on top and meat with fat globs clumped into it.  Seriously, if you are even considering mexican food - avoid this place.  I am truly baffled by the amount of 4 and 5 stars for this place....
