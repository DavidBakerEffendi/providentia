Be careful going to this location at night. I ordered my food and a lady by the name of Carol B helped me. She had a funny pungent odor as soon as she handed me my bags of food. So I began to eat my food when all of a sudden I felt something stringy after one bite of my burger and it was hair! It definitely did NOT belong to me. I went back to get a refund and she asked where did I find it, and I explained where. The cook even leaned in to wonder what happened and he "seemed" shocked. Wont go to That location ever again.
