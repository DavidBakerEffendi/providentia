This was by far the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten. I saw the mixed reviews and was in the area, and decided to try it out. 
      The queso. Velveeta cheese and rotel tomatoes and chillies. Although the chips are good, this was only so-so. Thanks to yelp we didn't have to pay for it! Free from the check in. 
      My friend and I shared two meals. One was one of the feasts. It came with lots of different things. All of which were disgusting. 
      The staff there are super nice. Our waitress was friendly and kept up with drinks and chips, so we tipped her well. We even met the manager, who also was super nice (and comped our meal). 
      Some suggestions: change the cook, or your ingredients. Guacamole should not be hot in an enchilada. Queso should not be made with velveeta at a restaurant. The prices are way too high. This is not authentic food and it makes my tummy sad (and sick).
