I went to this provider about 3 years ago. Dr. Mansoor charged me over 110 dollars per visit and what made it worst is I had insurance. My teeth hurt from a broken tooth and all she wanted to do is clean my teeth. I had my teeth cleaned 5 times within 8 months. The only good thing that came from that doctor is the oral surgeon they referred me to. I ended up going to another dentist because I was so frustrated with Dr. Mansoor. The other dentist I went to was awesome. He said he couldn't understand why they only cleaned my teeth when he could clearly see that my tooth was broken. I told the dentist that the first cleaning was fine. But Dr. Mansoor would only clean one side of my teeth and then made me come back to to do the other side. Then she would charge my insurance as a teeth cleaning. So she said I needed 3 deep cleanings.  That would be 9 visits. My insurance would only cover 2 cleanings. So after the second cleaning, which was the other side of my mouth. I had to pay full price which was around 150.00 dollars or more. After the 5th visit, I was so mad I cancelled my appointment and went somewhere else because my teeth still hurt. I still have all the receipts of all the over payments!
