After being told our wait would only be 10 minutes. We were told it would be another 10 minutes for the next 30 minutes of waiting. I understand that the restaurant business is a tough business that can unexpectedly become busy but it's unexceptionable to leave 4 tables dirty and empty without cleaning them to seat your customers. Embarrassing. Edit: after going to the host stand 20 minutes after my aunt was told there were parties ahead of us.  I was then told there were 5 parties ahead of us? I don't know how that's possible after watching 3 tables get sit. I will never be back here. There are a lot of other establishments I would support before waiting for your extremely average breakfast.
