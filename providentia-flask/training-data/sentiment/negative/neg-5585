Would give them a -5 stars if possible. If you enjoy chinese food don't ever come here! 

Food was epic failure. We had 3 dishes with rice and the total came up to $55. Seriously... Wth?!? 

The three dishes golden shrimp, garlic pork ribs and clams with xo sauce. The garlic shrimp was terrible! $20 for 10 pieces and they don't even get rid of the intestines! We fought to not be the one to eat it. The shrimps were so soggy and the shrimp were not very golden. The ribs were fried beyond redemption and were not marinated prior to frying. The only garlic in the dish were a little bit of minced pieces scattered on top of them extra crispy and dried ribs. The clams was the onlu edible dish and it was also only mediocre. 

This place is a trap. They know customers would never come back so they charge insane prices to stay open.
