I just returned from my very first time visiting Vegas. On my last night there, we wanted to do something special to go out with a bang, the seasoned Vegas vets I was traveling with, (who just happen to also be my parents) told me the fountains at the Bellagio were a MUST, so we strapped on our sneakers and headed out for the mile long trek down the strip. When we got there it was packed, after a while we were able to get up to the railing. After waiting about 20 minutes we started to get confused, the show should have started? We waited another 30 minutes and only then heard a faint recording on the speaker saying the show had been cancelled due to wind. Well I was out there and there was a light spring breeze but no real wind. Pretty upset for several reasons, I wasted my last night waiting for a show that was never going to happen, there should have been a BIG, continuous announcement it wasn't happening so me and the thousands of other disappointed people could have moved on with our night. I get it, it's a free show, you don't owe it to us, but it doesn't change how heartbroken we were over not getting to experience it and wasting hours in a quest to do just that.
