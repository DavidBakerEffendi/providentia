There was a time I ate there every week. I loved the Santa Fe skillet. It had great chicken and chorizo together. Then I started getting them with a pile of hash browns and very little else. I ate there today in Chandler because it was closest and we were looking for breakfast. Same exact thing. Totally tasteless almost entirely hash browns for $12.
