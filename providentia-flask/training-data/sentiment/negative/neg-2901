I know better than to eat here, it was great back in the day, but now the 3rd generation is running the place.  And I'm sure there hasn't been any upkeep since then, the place is dirty, run down, staff is rude.  

I had the carne asada dinner last nite, and within 10 mins of leaving I was sick.  That's it for me, I won't be back.  

BTW, don't go in the bathrooms, they were really dirty.
