The food isn't as great as the buffet at Wicked Spoon or Bellagio's..I bought a travelzoo deal and yea it's for two people and you get 2 wines, but still..the food is eh and not very great in quality. I do like how they have a sugar free dessert bar, but the ice cream was super watery that it melts once it's inside your bowl. The Chinese food pretty much sucked..the crabs weren't bad, I suppose the only thing I liked was the cauliflower and the pork siu mai..lots of salad selection though, so if you're into salad, sure why not..

I def wouldn't recommend this place nor would I ever want to go back. A bit of a disappointment and the line was a bit long and confusing because I wasn't sure where the line even started.
