This place doesn't really deserve 1 star but I needed to balance out the inflated scores other people are giving. It has been so incredibly hyped up that people who can't tell the difference between great food and average food will be compelled to give it 5 stars based on ambience and reputation alone.  
Yes, the atmosphere was farm-chic, but that also brings an air of snobby when you're close to Summerlin. That justifies them serving up extremely overpriced dishes that are average at best.
Don't get me wrong--I'm willing to spend the money for quality food. I've paid $1800 for a sushi meal for two before that I felt was worth every dollar, but the whole experience here left a sour taste in my mouth.
