I love how the other reviewers only ever had one review and it was for this place...makes you wonder if the reviews are genuine or just friends of the owner. The soft serve is average, I get the same from my yonanas machine. It's just frozen bananas mixed with a few toppings...easy to make  at home. What really ticks me off is they claim to use the finest ingredients yet they don't use organic and/or fair trade ingredients? Using the logic that the "finest ingredients" means handpicked themselves, I guess my yonanas soft serves are from the finest ingredients since I pick them out myself too! Honestly, save your money. This place is nothing too special, just get a yonanas machine and add the toppings yourself for much less. 

This company has claimed to be 100% vegan and then admitted that their toppings were not and it was a mistake. Sorry? You mean you didn't know 100% meant everything? 

They also claim to use the finest ingredients but hand picking bananas at metro is not "the finest ingredients". 

These claims are false and their product is average. Save your money. Will not be supporting this business until it lives up to its claims...that means fair trade, organic and 100% vegan.
