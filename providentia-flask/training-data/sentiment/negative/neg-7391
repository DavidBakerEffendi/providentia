We were going to the ghost bar at the Palms and decided to try out N9ne for dinner as it is right below the bar. After being seated it took over 10 minutes for our waiter to take the drink order. Another 15 minutes to take the food order and then we waited about an hour for the entrees to come out. When my Kobe beef burger came out, the fries were cold and tasteless and the burger was dry and completely tasteless. I would have been happier with a burger from TGIFridays or Islands. At $28 (the cheapest item on their menu) it was a ripoff. My brother had the surf and turf (lobster and filet mignon). The steak was very soft, but the lobster was chewy and again both were very bland.

Because we had friends with us totaling 6 people in our group, our waiter who we hadn't seen since he dropped off our food decided to include 20% gratuity on our bill, which was laughable. He thinks because our bill came out to $500, that he is entitled to a $100 tip?  What a joke. We left a $40 tip for him and on our way to the ghost bar he comes running out after us to tell us we hadn't paid in full. When we told him the service was lousy he got mad and started to argue with us. Very professional. Definitely no need to go back here again. I would have been more satisfied going to TGIF. The food and service are both better regardless of N9ne's prices.
