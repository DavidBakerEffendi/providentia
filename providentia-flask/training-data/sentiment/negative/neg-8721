Was there lastnight (7/7/11) for the Ty Herndon show.  Sat at the bar and took 22 minutes to get served.  The bartenders looked right at me and were just busy in their own conversations and horsing around.  It took another 40 mins to get another beer.
To top everything off, the IDIOT bartender LEO had ear plugs in, and would start just holloring like he was having a stroke or something and then start just banging on the bar with stuff or slamming the door into the wall to make noise.  Dude, if you dont like country music, take your ignorant ass somewhere else and work.  You ruined the experience for everyone at the bar that was there to LISTEN TO COUNTRY MUSIC AT A COUNTRY MUSIC ARTISTS BAR... you're a moron!  I will NEVER go back to this place and the icing on the cake for me...... I WORK IN COUNTRY MUSIC!  Worst bar experience EVER!!

PLEASE get rid of that LEO idiot !!!
