WORST PLACE IN TORONTO... Go to one of the other butchers in Roncie if you prefer good friendly service! 

The women that work at this place are heinously rude. They treat everyone who comes in like they're a burden and do nothing but roll their eyes at people and say insulting things about their customers in polish. They don't realize... Just because I don't order in polish, doesn't mean I don't speak it... 

Don't go to this place unless you wish to be humiliated to your face in another language. If you speak polish/Ukrainian/Slovak... Go in for a good laugh to see how a bad business is truly run...
