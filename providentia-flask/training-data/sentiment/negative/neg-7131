The receptionist was really rude. This morning we went there for brunch, while my friend was in regular line, I went to the Mlife line to ask if the Mlife member could be served seat right away, meanwhile I wasn't sure if I am a member (haven't been to Vegas for a while), so she said yes it's for Mlife VIP member. Ok I went back to the regular line and checked to see if I'm a Mlife member, and I found that I received lots of emails with my membership#. I went back to the VIP line again and showe her my emails, but she started feeling annoyed and impatient, didn't wanna assist me, but said VIP means I have to accumulate 25k points(something like that), new members are not qualified. Alright, I understand that, but the thing is that she didn't even wanna Check for me, how could you be sure I'm not a VIP? Or does the VIP member must show a VIP card? As receptionist you are supposed to be friendly, smile at least right? Even I am not VIP. But the way she treated me was so rude, like I'm begging to get in the buffet!? No way! There are better choices in Vegas! Not coming back!!!
