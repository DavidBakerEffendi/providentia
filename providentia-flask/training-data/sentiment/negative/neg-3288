Every Chipotle I've visited has provided excellent customer service and delicious food. Except for this location. I've come to this Chipotle at least four times when visiting family. Every time there has been an extremely long wait (longer than typical for a Chipotle...on average 20 minutes) and the staff just don't seem to know what they are doing. They have also consistently been out of items. This time they were out of fajita veggies and when I ordered them the employee said, "Well, we'd have to toss them and cook them..." and trailed off as if veggies were not available for the rest of the day. I asked if there would be a discount or something since it was a veggie bowl I was ordering, but there wasn't. Another employee chimed in that I finally asked to speak to a manager. About 10 minutes later I received the veggies on the side. The bathrooms were also out of toilet paper and paper towels and were indifferent to my husband when he informed them of it.  I can't fathom how these employees have managed to  keep a job at what is typically such a great chain. And the manager should be ashamed for hiring and keeping on such incompetent individuals. Chipotle has a great reputation, but it's poorly run establishments like this one that will destroy that good name. Makes me think twice about trusting the name Chipotle.
