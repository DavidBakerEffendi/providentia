The most horrible service on the planet... wanted to order food at 10 pm this evening, was a short gentleman with greasy hair at the register, completely ignored me didn't acknowledge me... nothing!.. and they weren't even busy, three customers sitting down at the most.  if you don't like working in the service industry, than don't! I'm currently a guest in this hotel and the food choices with limited room service is already an inconvenience. Very disappointed!
