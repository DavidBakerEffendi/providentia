I was meeting a friend for lunch today at Oregano's. We got there promptly at 11 and got a parking spot and tablemmediately. We ordered calamari as a starter. This was the absolute worst calamari that I ever tasted! It didn't even look like calamari. It was thick strips that tasted very very fishy. I understand that calamari is seafood, but this tasted like bad fish, plus it was way over coated and salty. We sent it back and ordered fried ravioli. When it arrived, it too, was way over salted and tasted stale. We ate a few but didn't send it back. Next came our pizza. We ordered the lunch slices. The portion was a good size, but the pizza was very mediocre and the crust had the same stale flavor as the ravioli. Although the service was good, the food was very bad and I would not recommend Oregano's to anyone.
