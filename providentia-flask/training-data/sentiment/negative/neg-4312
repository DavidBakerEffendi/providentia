I am so disappointed in Fridays what happened here? The Uncc one is straight hood this one makes food dry and poorly cooked. It took 15 min just to get a water.  My niece's steak wasn't cooked proper our chips took 15 min to get my mom's beer refill took 15 min. The theme here I guess is 15 min or more per item.
