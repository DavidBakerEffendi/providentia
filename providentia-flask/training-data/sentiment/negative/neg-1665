I had a previous bad experience with crappy service at this location but I'm a forgiving person so I thought I'd give them a second chance. I don't think these people could be any slower if they worked at it! This was ridiculous! I ordered two drinks. You read that right-2 drinks! Most of the locations in town would send someone to the drive thru lane to deliver the simple orders like that, but apparently not this one. Of course the guy behind me got his shake delivered. I won't EVER come back to this location. I gave up after sitting in line for 15 minutes AFTER I placed my order.
