We can here for a quick bite, got two sausage breakfast sandwiches, an iced latte and a hot mocha.

The sandwich tasted off... there was something wrong with the egg, cheese, or sausage. 

The mocha was decent, nothing spectacular. We didn't try the iced latte until we left. This is what really angered me.. there was no espresso or any caffeine in it and the milk was sour!!! I was so angry about this!! Guess what 3 hours later and food poisoning kicked in! I had to notify the health district, not sure what's going on at this particular Panera Bread but the other ones seem to be a  bit more on top of their game

I will not come back to this one
