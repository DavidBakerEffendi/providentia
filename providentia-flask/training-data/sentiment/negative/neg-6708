I don't even know where to start but NEVER GO HERE!!!!  we made a reservation for 8pm and we did not get seated until almost 845pm. I went and spoke to the manager because the whole reason we made a reservation is so we could make sure we got to the club in time.  He assured me that we would be out on time.  :you have my word you guys will be out on time." we sat down the food and drinks were OK a but very over priced.  When the bill came they charged us for some crazy fee called C and F charge. When we asked the server he said he wasn't sure what it was and would get the manager.  The same manager that is spoke to earlier came over.  He asked him about the fee and he said it is a resort fee and that there was nothing he could do about it.  What a resort fee to eat in a restaurant.  I have lived in Vegas for 6 years and work in the industry and have never heard of such a thing.  I asked him to show me where it says that i will be charged this fee and he refused to be cause it was not stated any where.  he was extremely rude and unprofessional.  Then i asked him what time it was and he said i don't know.  I asked him if he could find out and he said know.  I asked him what happened to us being out on time and that we have your word.  He laughed in my face.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I asked him if he was laughing in my face and said no even thought i watched him.  He then put his hand in my face and said I'm done talking to you and walked away.  I have never had an experience like this in my entire life.  i will be writing to the people a little higher up the chain because this is completely not acceptable.  I would never spend a dollar here again.
