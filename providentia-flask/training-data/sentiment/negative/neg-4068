Went here for dinner tonight with a craving for their fish tacos.  When the food arrived, there was only 2 tacos and maybe 7 broken yellow tortilla chips.  In the past this dish came with 3 fish tacos and half a plate of tri colored tortilla chips.  My fiancee got the Ahi salad and there was maybe 6 small pieces of tuna.  In the past, there was easily 3 times the tuna, and it was placed around the entire outer edge of the plate.  The price for each item was higher than in the past.  

Beware of shrinking portions and high prices here.
