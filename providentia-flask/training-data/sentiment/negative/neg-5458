Was visiting this area and was referred to visit here. There were four of us that walked in this past Sunday to watch some football and grab wings and beer. Place was pretty empty and got a seat right away. Server came over and took our order of 3 beers and a gin and tonic, 15 min later we finally received our drinks. The Gin and tonic sat so long at the bar there was barely any ice. It took about another 20 min to even order our food and once we ordered it took 35 minutes for simple wings and fries. Once the wings came out they were cold but didnt want to send them back just to wait another 30 min. All around a pretty horrible experience. Wouldn't recommend visiting here unless you want terrible service and terrible food. Its funny because I had read the reviews before I went and it said the service was horrible, I couldnt believe it was that bad but I was terribly wrong. Big thumbs down to this place.
