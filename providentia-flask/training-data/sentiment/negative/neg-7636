This place looked promising with its nice beer list with all the local brews. It was the bar half of California pizza kitchen. Service is what did them in. The bartender was super uninterested . Took him a few to greet me and seemed ambivalent. Sold me a beer and brought it. When I inquired about if there was only this one giant size he said no there's s smaller pint size but when he's working everyone gets the large one. I had only a few minutes between flights and would have preferred the small.felt ripped off but it's an airport bar so I guess the norm.
