My wife and I arrived for breakfast at about 8AM. The service started off fine.  We ordered our food and it came out in about 2 minutes, eggs over medium with ham and I got the breakfast burrito.  Great, but it made us wonder if it was pre-made, sitting under a heat lamp.  Then we got the answer.  My wife's eggs over medium were over cooked.  One egg yolk was solid, no run.  We asked for the eggs to be made again.  Once again the eggs came out in less then 2 minutes and they were the same, over cooked.  My wife asked for them to be taken away.  The bill came and there was no discount for the poorly cooked eggs.  When I noted this to the waitress, she said she thought the Manager had taken it off.  The Manager then came over and said she would take $2.50 off for the eggs my wife didn't like.  The waitress was then very surly and was tipped accordingly.   I think they pre-make a lot of food to get ready for the rush.  We are never going to this US Egg again.
