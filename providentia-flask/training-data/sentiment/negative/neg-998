Great expectations, but sadly, Meh. 

Food is so-so and service is beyond poor. Seems that if you order barbecue and are Korean-speaking, you'll get more attentive service and your banchan will be served before others. At least that was our experience. We witnessed other tables who were complaining about their service, as well. 

We had to ring the "doorbell" several times; first to place our order and then to find out where it was. Galbi portion was smaller than other restaurants. No mustard or vinegar so that customers can season to taste? No egg for the soon dubu? Broken noodles in mul naengmyun?  Clearly showed us that they don't care about their food presentation or their customers, either. 

There are so many other places that provide great food and attentive service and are happy that you're dining with them.
