I cannot stress how bad this food and environment are. I feel like they should be shut down. I don't fully scoff at hole in the wall places so I was willing to give it a shot hop get for a great food experience. Horrible, just horrible. Horrible everything. Soft mush rice, unidentifiable meat, dirty water glass, all other tables dirty upon arrival. Late salad. Just bad. Do not go here.
