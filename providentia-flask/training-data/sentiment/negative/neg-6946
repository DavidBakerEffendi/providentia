I went there with my friend on a Friday for lunch and we were really disappointed with the food taste. First we ordered calamari, I definitely had better ones. Then some dim sum, I didn't like them. I can't recall the name we tried a dish of pork which was inside a dough kinda thing, that was ok because it didn't taste like anything. That was for sure my first and last visit there
