I am not impressed with this place, my original review makes this clear. However, the fact that they were closed on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend makes them useless in my book. I was bringing two friends who had never been there, and still haven't because they were closed.

Businesses up and down Central Ave were busy, especially Hula's. They could have gotten the overflow from Hula's but they were closed at 7:30 on a Sunday night.
