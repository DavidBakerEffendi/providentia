Make sure you take your id with you if you decide to order an adult beverage because in spite of lcb law requiring photo Id if you appear to be 30 the barmaids here require it of everyone even if you are in your 50's...
No wonder the place is empty.
I guess I also need to add my only issue wasn't simply the fact of someone who is clearly over 50, with gray hair and wrinkles needed to provide id (which I did). And here's the link to the pa lcb poster for training purposes...

I also sat for a very long period of time without being acknowledged, the bar itself had not been cleaned, I asked for a bar towel to clean it myself, staff members were arguing with each other publicly (which was uncomfortable).
This establishment is poorly managed.
