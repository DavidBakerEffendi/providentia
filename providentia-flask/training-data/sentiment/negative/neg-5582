Just ordered combo #11  dinner combo drive thru.  It's chicken strips, onion rings, hush puppies, and toast.  It was ridiculous!!!!  There's only 1 onion ring and the rest in the dinner box was hard as rocks.  I didn't checked my order before I left but I should have not trusted these kids.  Never again i will order at these place!  Wasted my money and had to throw the food.  This place just don't care!!!
