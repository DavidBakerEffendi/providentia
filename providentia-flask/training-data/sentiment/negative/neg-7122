Service is okay but food is just terrible.

Crispy calamari $10.99 - yes its deep fried but it was just filled with so much oil that it felt like I drank a cup of oil

Hot BBQ beef brisket $10.99 - the beef was dry and the sandwich was suppose to come with BBQ sauce. There was no evidence of sauce being placed in my sandwich. $2.99 extra to add yam fries. The fries were good.

Fried chicken and waffle $16.99 - chicken was dry and would much rather have KFC chicken.

For the price I was really expecting much more. Its one of the rare occassions that I could not finish my meal. The food looks good in appearance but looks can be deceiving.
