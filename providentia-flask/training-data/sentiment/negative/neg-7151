Horrible does not describe this experience. The website states must have reservation.  I made the reservation.  We come in there's three tables seated  she asked if we have a reservation.  I say we do, not understanding why you have to have a reservation when your restaurant is empty .We had to wait for the meats to be brought out, very limited. The hot bar and salad bar did not have everything that was listed on the menu. We ordered sodas. Hey bring out glasses of ice with canned sodas and flexi straws how tacky is that? We asked for refills and got 2 more canned sodas. We got the bill they had charged us $3 for each can of soda. When I question this the owner tried to tell me that's what Texas de Brazil charges I in fact have been there and no that is not what they charge for sodas, beverages are free refills and your glasses are kept full at Texas de Brazil. And they do not bring the drinks out on cans. If you want to go to Brazilian steakhouse Texas de Brazil is the place to go. If I had not had a Groupon when we walked in the door we would have left because of the rancid smell of the place. They also give you one set of tongs that they place on the table and they allow the skewers to touch your plate when they're serving the meat. This is an experience we will never forget that we will never repeat! This will be a great goupon for your worst enemy.
