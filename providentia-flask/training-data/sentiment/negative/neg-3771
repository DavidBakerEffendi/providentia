I have rated over 100 places on yelp and have yet to want to give a place NEGATIVE stars if I could...until I stumbled upon this dump. I couldn't WAIT to get home to write this review.  Not only was the food nasty the service was horrible, and the manager, Tyler should be ashamed of himself. Whoever hired Tyler needs a camera in his restaurant to see his demeanor towards guests. A group of 25 of us made dinner reservations here to celebrate our friend's birthday. I ordered the mozzarella as an appetizer and the chicken ranch as my entr√©e. The mozzarella (home made) was nothing special. The chicken was battered and deep fried-but actually burned.  I couldn't eat it so i asked for a side of marinara-hoping it would taste better. Wow the marinara was the most disgusting sauce I had ever had.  Canned tomato sauce tastes better.   By the way they charge you $3 for that crap. Everyone hated their food.  Furthermore, they wouldn't split the check more than 6 ways. They wouldn't allow us to bring our cake out. The manager came out upon our request, we asked him where the nearest ATM was and he had the nerve to roll his eyes at us. He was so unbelievably rude. I was astonished. He refused to split the check further and was basically yelling at us.  He should be fired. I wish there was more I could do about this. He ruined our dinner. The service was also lacking. None of the food came out together at one time.  DON'T COME HERE. You get better pizza at Papa John's or Dominoes for a quarter of the price. I promise.  BEWARE
