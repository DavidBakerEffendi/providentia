Tried it for restaurant week. I don't think they realize this is supposed to be Mexican and not BBQ. Queso has smoked ground beef as do the tacos. Pork carnitas ., same. Tortilla soup tastes like Campbell's vegetable soup in a can. The chicken was shredded bits and it's all veggies. No tortilla strips! We thought the food was just awful
