!! I feel pretty disappointed . I came to this place because I wanted to experience a different meal . but what I took was a disappointment . I ordered to carry , I order a Lasagna that  I did not feel fresh . it's  seemed that its have several days . the Empanadas where Terrible and worst of all, the Russian salad I ordered was ruined . I knew from the beginning when I opened the foam plate the smell of decomposed that had . My wife told me I had to return that food . But You know What People. I preferred to let them know what You are exposing Yourselves to go to this place . its okay I pay nearly $ 25 dollars for an old ruined food . I work in a restaurant . in my work these kinds of things are unforgivable . because a restaurant depends on how the customer is satisfied .to make many customers.I will not return the food . but never return to this place . first and last time !!
