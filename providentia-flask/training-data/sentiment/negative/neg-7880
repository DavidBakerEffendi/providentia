Biggest joke and dump of a steakhouse I've ever seen.  1 man show running this bait n switch joint.  Bought groupon called same gentleman took reservation and never stated anything about $10 upcharge per person for the "better" meats.  I don't know what could be better.  Asked for medium well style was offered sirloin tips 3 times medium, and medium rare.  The chicken looked like it was 5 days old.  Salad bar consisted of cardboard lettuce and some dressing.  Got side dishes of cold mashed potatoes and rice.  Place was a gem. Paid $50 for 1 piece of garlic toast.  Avoid this place at all costs we walked up and left.  Once they find out you won't pay the mystery upcharge that is nowhere in the menu or posted they give 2 shits about you.  McDonald's was the better option.
