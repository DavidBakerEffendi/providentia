It's a Sunday afternoon and I decided to take kids here for dinner. So far our dining experience was good until today. I ordered a Bistec a la Tampiqueña. The steak was not what I am used to. Not what my husband had in our last visit. This was a barely grilled ribeye steak. Tasted "poached". What I am used to is a big strip of skirt steak nicely charred grilled with a piece of cheese melted on top. The rice and beans tasted generic. Nothing like our previous visit. I even ordered a piña colada and it was horrible. I asked the waitress if the drink was made fresh, fresh pineapples at least. She said it is just a standard mix they use. Well now I know they don't make fresh fruity drinks at their bar. I get really bent out of shape when I spend $$$ on food that is not good. This was a very disappointing dining experience.
