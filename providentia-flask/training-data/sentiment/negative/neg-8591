I got home one day and one of their menus was at the door. Ordered and here's my experience:

The lady who answers the phone is not very well-versed in customer service. English is obviously not her first language and the way she responds when she doesn't understand you just comes off rude.

The pizza was undercooked, the wings were greasy w/no seasoning, the fries that came with them were cold and rubbery. The breaded mushrooms were ok although too much breading.
