Service was cold not a welcoming atmosphere. The food was not amazing our chow mien was swimming in a puddle of oil, the egg rolls were not edible you could see the oil moving around in between the egg roll skin layers. You get a free drink for yelp check in and they insisted on reading my review before I got the free drink. Very awkward.
