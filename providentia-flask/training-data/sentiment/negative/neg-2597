As a big fan of pokebowls, I was a bit disappointed by the place. At this place you can either make your own bowl or choose one pre-made for about the same price (16-18$). I made one with spicy salmon, rice, and then added some usual veggies and garnishes such as cucumber, carrots, avocado. The result turned out unexpected. The bowl had wayyyy too much mayo and carrots and not enough of the other ingredients. It was very unbalanced and I found it too pricey for what it was. With tax and tips I paid 22$ for a pokebowl...

As for the service, the 2 staff were quite nice and made us try some sauce before ordering. However, towards the end, the waiter seemed to pressure us to leave when half of the restaurant was empty. 

Don't think I would come back.
