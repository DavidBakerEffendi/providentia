We have tried this spot a few times due to it's convenient location, and usually enough time has passed between visits that we forget, but there is consistently something wrong or outright missing from every order. Every time! A shame, too, last time we went the guy at the register was super friendly and helpful, but when we got home things were missing... 
We've tried different shifts (different crew), different months, drive thru vs walking in... No improvement. Like I said in the beginning, usually enough time has lapsed between our last attempt to order food here that when Carl's Jr comes up in conversation we forget that this particular restaurant is cursed. 

Looks like we're gonna be going somewhere else from now on.
