This is THE-PLACE-TO-GO... if you like Tandoori bones !!! They also have Goat bones in curry and beef bones !!!  mmmmm...mmmmm....   but... there is a caveat... they ration the Tandoori bones so only a few are released into the buffet each half an hour or so... you better keep guard right next to the serving tray because they go fast !!!

This is the #1 meeting spot for Paleontologists and Archaeologists in Toronto and the surrounding areas...

Oh... and there was this one time when I was standing in line at the buffet and this clown in black shirt just cut in line and bumped me! oh... and there was also that time while I was working for another client, that there was a couple making the sex there...

The only positive is the people in costume...(I would go back just for that reason)
