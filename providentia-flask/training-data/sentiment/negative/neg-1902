[LOCATION] - 3/5
This place is located on Major Mackenzie Dr W and Weston Rd. There weren't that many fun things to do in that area, but there were ample spots in the parking lot. 

[SERVICE] - 3/5
Average service, orders were placed with an iPad for both À La Carte and All You Can Eat options. 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
Comfy and cozy Japanese bar vibes. Chairs and booths were quite comfortable. 

[QUALITY] - 1/5
We ordered items from the à la carte menu, and the quality of items were below average for the price. 

[ORDER] - 1/5
- Chicken Pad Thai - $12.95: noodles were too soggy, and there was an overwhelming ketchup smell/taste. Unfortunately, this dish did not taste authentic. 

- Maki Combo - $16.95: sushi rolls were average, nothing spectacular, and definitely not worth the price.

[OVERALL] - 1/5
Food was below average, and not worth the prices on the à la carte menu. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place if you want Japanese food for a decent value.
