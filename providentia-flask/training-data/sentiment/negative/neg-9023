Three trips in and it just doesn't improve. I'm not sure I've ever had consistently bad service at a new place in my life. No care in the world from the staff, wrong food, incorrect tab ... it's almost as if the motto of the place is "be as rude as possible to the costumer and maybe they'll come back." If this place is around in 8 months I'll be shocked.
