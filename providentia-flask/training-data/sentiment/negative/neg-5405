Ambience is nice, and staff is very friendly. That's about all I can say positive about this place. It's very pricey (one chicken breast is $5). For the amount of money you pay, I would expect a little more flavor (doesn't seem like they season the chicken before they batter it) so remember to bring your salt and pepper shakers with you.
