Quite awful. Greasy. Beef and broccoli was 80% broccoli and the pieces were HUGE so they took up most of the room in the bowl. Hardly any sauce at all. Ordered egg fried rice by #, got home and some nasty looking fried rice with cubed meat, jumbo shrimp and huge raw onion chunks were in it's place. Crab puffs were all dough - maybe 1/4 teaspoon filling. I really have nothing positive to say about the place.
Not cheap, either for what you get. Tried it once and I will never be back.
