Sorry I'm not korean. Did not clean the table for a larger group, but seated othwr people that speakn korean and walk tight in. if you speak korean, you go in first while we watch. Forgot to take drink order from one of the girls, took order and forgot to bring 1 persons food out. Check was a mess. We have greats stories of how bad this experience was. Did not communicate well. Customers felt ignored.
