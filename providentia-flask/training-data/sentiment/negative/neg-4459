The manager tore up the check into pieces angrily when you complained the dish was not fully cooked! 

I am a regular customer and I went to peppermint on 8/8 lunchtime. I ordered green curry. When the dish came, the beef and the chicken were not fully cooked. The rice was very hard, seemed still frozen, I showed the waitress the sterdy  " rice ball" and asked her give me a new dish of green curry, not just reheat. 

How when the dish came, apparently it was a reheat one. ( because I ate one shrimp and some avocado. There's no avocado and just one shrimp) 

I wanted to complain but  no manager was there until I was ready to go. Once I saw her I told her what was going on. She denied immediately and said it's impossible. I said the curry just 10 dollars something, I don't have to lie. She suddenly tore up the check into pieces! She said is it what you want? Ok don't worry about the money!

I can't believe how rude a person can be!
