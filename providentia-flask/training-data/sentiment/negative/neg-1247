THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR THE FOOD. Last night  2/4/17 approximately 9:00pm me and wifey decided we wanted some soup and salad. When I entered the restaurant there were four people at the front desk one of which was on the phone. I stood there for at least a minute and a half and not one of the other staff asked me can I help you. Once the lady got off the phone she immediately asked me can I help you as the other staff continued to talk amongst themselves. I told her a table for two and she told me it will be about a half hour wait and gave me a buzzer. I took the buzzer and went outside and told the wife it will be a half hour wait but I didn't like how I was left unattended and I don't want to stay because of it. I took the buzzer back inside and informed the lady who gave it to me that we changed our mind and we ended up going somewhere else too eat. Service was on the back burner this night and Olive Garden lost our business. Fortunately not forever but this night, yes.
