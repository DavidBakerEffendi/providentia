The place is beautiful, let's get that out of the way.  She's a pretty lady with an empty head.  Where are all of the fabulous perks people keep mentioning on here?  

My husband and I booked our 15-year anniversary through the Venetian's website which means we booked our vacation through Las Vegas Sands, which is owned by another company, blah, blah, blah.  I only say that because our vacation dates, flight, hotel was absolutely screwed up by Las Vegas Sand Vacations.  We are on our way to the airport, on the phone with the LVSV letting them know that they have a date/time incorrect. LOTS of drama for our departure date.  Flight change and hotel change fee for the departure date. 

Don't even get me started on our return date!  Who books a hotel departure on a Sunday and the flight for the day before on a Saturday?  Las Vegas Sands vacations does!  We had pay ANOTHER flight change fee when we got to the airport to leave on Sunday, the same day we checked-out of the hotel.  Of course we couldn't reach Las Vegas Sands Vacations because it's a Sunday.  So we paid the change fee and had to leave at midnight which is way later than it was supposed to be scheduled for.  Oh, and they screwed up our departure dates and plans as well.  LOTS of drama.  So we called during business hours on Monday and complained only to be told that we had to submit our complaint via email to the After Vacation Department.  We did and were basically told that they would not reimburse of any fees, oh and here is a $100 voucher to come stay with us again!  Seriously!!!???
