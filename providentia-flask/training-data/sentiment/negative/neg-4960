Talk about being led astray.  What a dump.  Absolute garbage food.  Sure it is cheap, but would you really pay up for this poor quality?  No soap in the bathroom.  The tables were dirty too.  Yuck!  My cheese wasn't melted and my meat was undercooked.  Everything was cold.  There was a ridiculous amount of sour cream and funky guacamole poured over everything and it is the straight from the 5 gallon bucket kind of sauces.  Never again!
