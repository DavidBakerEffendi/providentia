I've been here many times and every time I'm disappointed. It's funny because I always say I'm never going back but then 3 or 4 months later I give it another chance. It's been horrible ever since they renovated a few years ago.
Yesterday I went to see the 49ers play the Panthers at 1pm with my buddy Tom. It took a while to get the game on and it took about 30 minutes to get a beer ordered. Our waitress left at 2:15 and we paid our bill. After that nobody came to see us for 3 hours (I'm not even kidding). At 5:15 a new server came and asked if we needed anything so we asked for the manager. When the manager showed up we explained our story and he said there was nothing he could do.
Also, they changed the game on out tv at around 4:15 and there was still almost 8 minutes left. We missed a 75 yard touchdown pass and the 9ers were only 7 points back at that point.
The manager could have offered us a free beer and we would have stayed to eat supper and spend more money, but because he's an idiot we went over to La Belle et La BÃªte and spend our $100 there. It was amazing btw!
