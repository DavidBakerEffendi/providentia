We have been here twice and this is by far the worst place in Vegas. First time they completely forgot one of our meals but whatever we still went back because the food was decent and it was close. I called and made reservations and specifically said I need a high chair. When we got there they told us we need to wait thirty minutes despite our reservation because they took a big party. They were not even apologetic. So then I was like fine can I get a high chair they said on no we gave it to the big party... I told them I called ahead stating I need one and they said yea well we gave it to someone else. We just left they did nothing to even try to accommodate. Only go here if you want to be treated badly. Worst place in Las Vegas hands down including dives... You'll get better service at a 24 hour hole in he wall filled with smoke and the food is not that great... Over priced beans and rice.
