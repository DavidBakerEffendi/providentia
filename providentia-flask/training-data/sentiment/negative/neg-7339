I'm confused how this place has so many great ratings. It's a hole-in-the-wall, which I'm fine with. Sometimes those places throw down, but in this case? The atmosphere matched the food. It was awful. Shumai were microwaved to an inedible temperature, when they cooled, were rock hard. The seaweed salad arrived partially frozen. The spicy tuna roll? I have no idea what it was. See the photo. It was a ton of breading? Mayo just on the top? Brown tuna? I left hungry and went to Swiss Chalet.
