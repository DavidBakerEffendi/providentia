I used to get take out and dine in here at least 2 times a week until time after time issues I.e.; chicken literally frozen in the middle once and numerous times chewy chicken or beef. It grossed me out so I stopped ggetting anything from there for the past 8 months..I ordered take out tonight . Thai Fried Rice w/chicken. Portion is great if I wanted to eat it. :( flavorless Thai fried rice full of frozen peas and carrots? Umm no thank you. So, I'm out. I hate wasting money on food that I don't enjoy eating.
