The people are friendly but they insist on selling food they know to be bad. I recently bought a couple packages of hotdogs and when I got home I found that there was a layer of thick slime coating each hotdog. I called the store and gave them the package details so they could pull the affected packages. The next day I went back and found the hotdogs still on the shelf. I emailed Food Lion customer service and finally received a response stating they would take care of it. I decided to go back to the store to see how they handled it. All thy did was mark the price way down to sell it quicker. They do not care about their customers' health, only their bottom dollar. STay away from this company and any company affiliated with them unless you feel like gambling with your health.
