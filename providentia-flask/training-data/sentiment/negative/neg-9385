The lady in the speaker box on Monday 7/31 at 6:05 pm was super rude. I asked if they could make a blizzard out of chocolate and she started screaming I don't do chocolate ice cream!!! I asked if I could do a chocolate concrete instead and she again shouted I DONT HAVE CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM!!! It was my understanding that ice cream and Custard were two different things, but I'm not an ice cream professional. I thanked her for her time. I know that people don't have high expectations for customer service on boulder highway but I was not rude to her or ever raised my voice and I was only asking about the chocolate options. I highly suggest the people in the speaker box come to realize that if they hate their lives they do not have to take it out in customers who are not being aggressive.
