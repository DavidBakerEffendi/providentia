This place is insane. I know it's Chinese and all, but the woman answering the phone doesn't know a lick of English. We spent 5 min on the phone just trying to give an address. And that's 5 minutes of my life I will never get back. Then out of sheer frustration (and hunger), I hung up on the incompetent operator. She then proceeded to call back no less than 5 times. If you are hungry, don't call them. But if you want a good laugh, I highly recommend.
