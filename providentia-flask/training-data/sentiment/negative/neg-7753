I been to delhi palace. The service guys and manager have no sense of manners. When we are in middle of our lunch or dinner, he brings bill and waits there to pay. When serving water, they have no manners. They spill all over the table and don't even tell sorry or clean. This is the worst hotel i have seen here which has this bad service.

Food is not that great. It is ok.
