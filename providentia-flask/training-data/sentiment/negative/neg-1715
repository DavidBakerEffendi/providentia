Our first experience to Libretto's was on July 12. The pizza was terrific. Headed back the following Saturday, 7/19, with the family. Ordered two pies: sicilian and white pizza. I don't think I've ever had this happen. Someone reheated the white pizza from the case! It was stale, burnt, brown on top, quite disgusting. I informed our server who "tasted it for himself" to see if he agreed. We had to wait for another pie to be prepared fresh. No adjustment made in our bill. No apology from a manager. Too many other places to get pizza in Charlotte. Oh and how do we know the pizza came from the case? It was full when we came in; one pie was missing when we left.

Won't be back at Libretto's.
