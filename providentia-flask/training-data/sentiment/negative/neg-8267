This was the worst experience I've ever had. Couldn't change my reservation to 7:30 when it was originally 7. The vibe was instantly creepy they had karaoke elevator music with no words playing the entire time.  No one in the restaurant. They had a salad bar very few options. My drink was a disaster the lime garnish was rotten. The "hostess" / server continues to grab our dirty plates places them on clean tables then picks them up doesn't wipe the table so it's now dirty which was irritating to watch. I don't know how this place is open honestly NEEDS TO BE ON RESTAURANT RESCUE !! Won't be open for long. Don't waste your money !! Not to mention it's also expensive !!!
