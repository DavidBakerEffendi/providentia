I've been into Chicago Dogs lately and have found a few excellent stands in Las Vegas.  Sadly this was not one of them.  I somehow even managed to get food poisoning from this place which ruined the rest of my day.   I don't mind paying for great food, but I have to agree that $9 for a poorly constructed dog and a few soggy fries is a bit much.  My pickle was a sliver which consisted of the outer SKIN of the pickle and very little else.  My bun broke because it was too dry, and it was generally a sloppy mess.  

I realize true vintage style often includes blackened door jams but I could have done without seeing the grime on the windows and walls. 

Bad reviews are not my thing, I have a few businesses myself and I know how challenging it can be to service the public, but the food poisoning was just not easily overlooked.  

I would not recommend.
