I'm extremely disappointed in El Chorro  after tonight's special dinner for my mother's birthday turned out to be a regret. After being seated we ordered drinks, 25 minutes later and being told at least four times that my drink was coming, I find out they cannot make an Appletini and have to order something else. This was shortly followed by being served hard, Old tasting sticky buns, which was a major selling point for them. Still I reserved judgement, that was until I got my over-salted beef stroganoff and waited another 20 minutes for my second drink. After hearing that the experience was lacking, the server abruptly went to get the manager as if we had upset him in some way. The manager, Ryan then comes over to the table, pretends to listen and gives a generic  insincere apology accompanied by the gesture to make things right and ensure we finish having had a great experience. This by the way did not happen. He did nothing, no discount to the bill, gesture for a future visit or even something as small as dessert which would be a minimal offer after spending over $200. Overall this was a disappointing experience especially on what should have been an enjoyable and memorable day for my mother. Poor service was giving from the start and followed up with over promising and under delivering. Sad to say but I have removed El Chorro from the list of restaurants I would recommend. Note that I heard this restaurant is under new management which way be the reason why both quality and service have gone downhill. I have eaten here many times which is why this is even more disappointing
