360 Gourmet Burrito is not a bad chain, but this location is awful. Pretty much any on-airport alternative would be better. Unfortunately, the B9-B15 gate area has only two options, this and Einstein Bagels, and neither has anywhere to sit and eat. 360 has some uncomfortable standing positions only.  

I ordered a quesadilla with cheese, guacamole,  and steak. What was served to me was a grilled, nearly-burnt tortilla with cheese and a little steak folded into it. No seasonings (the quesadilla is supposed to have tomato, oregano, cilantro, red onion, diced garlic & jalapenos, but all had been omitted. As was the guacamole, for which I had paid extra, and the salsa. And weirdly, it was served in a bowl.  

I took it away to try to find somewhere to eat, and only then realized what I had received. Took it back, was given a tiny condiment cup of guacamole and one of salsa. The cashier was completely distracted and got the order wrong, and had trouble making $12.07 change from a $20.  The cook apparently did not know how to make the menu item.  I had about 1/4 of the "quesadilla" and threw the rest away. 

If I could give 0 stars, this place deserves it. There's a nice Mexican place in the C gates (Jose Cuervo Tequileria) as well as Pei Wei Asian diner. I have had good meals at both.  But avoid this place at all costs.  I will be writing 360's corporate office to tell them that their chain is very badly represented at LAS.
