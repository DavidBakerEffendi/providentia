Apparently, my wife and I are invisible! We arrived at about 1:30 on a Thursday afternoon, pleased to see so many cars parked in the lot. The place is divided into separate rooms for dining and for a bar area. We went into the eating area and waited, and waited, but no one ever came. The one couple who were eating said to just take a table and the waitress would be in. After more waiting,a group of 5 entered the eating area. They were immediately seated, given menus, and had their drink orders taken. The waitress never acknowledged that we were present, carefully putting her back to us when she waited in the other people. 
There are too many other great places in Vegas to tolerate this. We left and found one.
