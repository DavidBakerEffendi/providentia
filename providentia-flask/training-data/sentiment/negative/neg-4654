This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  The food was okay, the service was okay, but they overcharged us for a salad and then the server told us we were not allowed to pay in cash.  He told us that it was the owner's policy not to keep change in the restaurant so if we wanted any change we would have to walk down to the gas station.  We thought that was a weird policy for a small business so the server suggested we talk to the owner.  After paying our bill (as charged without asking for the salad item to be changed) the owner came over.  He started berating us and telling us we didn't know how to read the bill.  He told us they were lying about the no-change policy the server spent 15 talking to us about.  We asked him why he was being so aggressive and he started yelling at us to get out of the restaurant.  He told us he didn't need our business because they are one of the top ten restaurants in Phoenix.  Not even close.
