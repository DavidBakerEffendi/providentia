I took my daughter here this evening for a treat - she loves Sushi! My order arrived first and since she was hungry and waiting.. i gave her some of mine. After mine was finished  - 20 minutes or so later.. we continued to wait for her roll.. Then my 14 year old daughter flagged down a server since ours was no where to be seen. About 5 minutes or so later she got her order and hungrily gobbled it all down. It seems her order was forgotten. Next time we will do a lunch at Big Catch (Market on Mcleod) for a reasonably priced, reliable and quality Sushi meal. I am proud of how my daughter handled this. The food was good, but the neglectful service ruined our intention of having a nice meal out.
