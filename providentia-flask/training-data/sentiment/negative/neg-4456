Terrible food--- this past weekend I ordered the gnocchi & lobster ravioli. The gnocchi itself was $20! That doesn't include seafood or any meat. I couldn't even take two bites out of the entree. It's hard to go wrong with gnocchi (it's my fave). But mannnnn....

so disappointed.

The lobster ravioli was ok, but I'll warn you... It's super duper salty.
