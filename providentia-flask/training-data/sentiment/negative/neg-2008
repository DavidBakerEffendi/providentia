The parking lot at Greenland is less hectic than 168 Market's, but in my opinion that's the only redeeming quality about it. Inside, it is cramped and organized in a way that does not make sense. If you have a cart, get ready to squeeze your way past people because there is barely any room in the aisles. Although this market has a variety of Asian goods, it is primarily a Korean market. Probably my fault for coming here in the first place because it's named Greenland KOREAN supermarket, but be aware that if you are looking for Japanese ingredients it might be difficult to find what you need. 

I was looking for packaged mochi for the New Year, and the kind I usually buy does not need refrigeration. After looking alllllll over the store, I finally found it shoved between Korean rice cakes in a corner of the refrigerated section. They also did not carry a vegetable that is commonly used in Japanese New Year cooking, which I found at 168 last year. 

Even though I was after specific things, I don't feel as though my shopping trip here should have been so frustrating and claustrophobic.
