I'm so disappointed. This restaurant has completely gone down hill but the prices have gone up tremendously for a restaurant that's only been open 8 months. I've noticed them creep up over the past few months but the service and quality stayed the same so I didn't mind. 
Proteins that were standard options are now on the premium list and the server didn't do the awesome box presentation they once did. 
I haven't been in since December and it's just silly now.   We paid $50 for a 2 entr√©es (including tip).  My guest and I both had water.  For a mediocre  (at best) meal, it's just not worth it. 
For a place that I would recommend with  unwavering conviction before, I won't be back again.
