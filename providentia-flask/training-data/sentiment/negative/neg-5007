Stopped in for lunch today, the girl at the counter had no clue what she was doing. In stead of ordering my meal like I had told her. She ordered everything separate. When I went to fill my medium cup. I ordered a large, there were ants crawling all over the fountain machine. Needless to say this has ruined my j in b opinion on service and cleanliness.
