this got to be the worst Sam Woo i've ever been.. 
I have been to the ones in San Gabriel and Orange County, none of those places come as worse as this place. 
Itz like a disgrace to Chinese food, and i was fooled by it. 
Wonton noodle was awful, noodle was way overcooked and wontons tasted like itz been in freezer for a long time. 
small portion and high in price?  
No thanks, i'd rather eat chinese food in casinos where at least they have some standards to keep.
