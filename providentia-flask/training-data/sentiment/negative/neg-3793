I should've known by the stupid name... This place sucks. McDonald's quality food served on a metal prison tray. 

Americans are willing to pay for and eat crap as evidenced by all of the Hello Bistros popping up around Pittsburgh.  

I explained to the counter girl who was too busy to greet us when we walked in the door that we had never been there before and I asked her how things worked. Looking around I could tell this was another do it yourself, assembly line Ã  la Chipotle type restaurant. The enthusiasm that she displayed in her explanation made me feel like she was more concerned about getting back to her cigarette that she left burning on the ledge outside the back door than she was about my dining experience. 

Stand up Americans. You deserve better. Don't eat here, don't accept this kind of mediocrity. It's not like your electing the next president, this is important.
