The people at Wrap & Grab have managed to turn an uncomplicated meal into a sopping mess. 

I ordered the falafel platter to go. The falafel balls were hard as a rock and weren't cooked fresh in front of me. Though I try not to waste food I ended up throwing away most of the rice as it was stale and hard. 

My biggest restaurant annoyance is stale rice. It's the easiest thing to cook in the world of cuisine, and there is no reason to have stale rice during the busiest hour of a weekday. 

As an added 'bonus', the staff shortchanged me.
