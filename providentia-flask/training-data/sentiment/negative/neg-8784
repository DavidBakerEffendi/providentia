Visiting family here in Brampton from out of country, somebody mentioned Harvey's so we went there. Hands down one of the worst fast food experiences I've ever had to deal with. The tall lanky brown kid (who might've been the manager) had the worst demeanor and body language I've ever seen from any employee. Just yelling at employees and overall sh*t attitude. Each one of the employees looks like they hate their job, especially that brown kid. Food was below average, didn't finish it. Definitely won't ever go back.
