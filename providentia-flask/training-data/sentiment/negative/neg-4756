Potbelly is a chain.  They just opened.  Maybe our experience was due to the start-up growing pains, but all four in our party were quite disturbed and on the verge of walking out.  Not because of the food, which was average/ok, but because of the  attitude of one worker and the shift manager at the time of our visit.  Maybe this Franchise/chain was short on help, but this "manager" clearly was not trained in proper  food service or customer care.  Instead, this person behaved like they did not want to be there and made sure the cloud over their head would spread to everyone else.  This person was rude and treated us like we were such a hassle since it was our first time and we asked a few questions (Eeep!).  When there was a mistake on the order, the shift manager thought it was unreasonable that my buddy ask for a refund on the couple bucks difference and had the attitude like we were nickle-and-diming scum.  With so many terrific food options nearby, this particular Potbelly store will do without four repeat customers.  Bye.   :(
