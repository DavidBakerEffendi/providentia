This is my 1st time in Vegas, and this was my 1st buffet in Vegas.  If THIS is the standard I can expect to find at other buffets...I think I'll skip them.  

I understand that buffets in Vegas are a dime a dozen, so I would think that the casinos would up their game to draw diners into their buffets.  But it would appear that the opposite is happening.  I don't know if it's a numbers game, with the sheer volume of visitors guaranteeing these buffets patronage out of convenience.  Or if, the quality of buffet food is what it is, so they just roll with it.   My hopes are still up for the next one later this week.

As for Treasure Island's "seafood buffet"...uh what?  What seafood?  Crab legs, cold & pre-split.  Vegas, STOP DOING THAT!  Leave the crab legs whole!  Shrimp, cold and deveined, and void of flavor.  As for the rest of the seafood selections...a couple of fish options (both dry) and a sushi station, which was a joke.

The rest of the buffet was very pedestrian, with typical choices.  Prime rib, pre-sliced (why?!!!!) was salty and lacking any richness.  Korean short ribs, were not even close.  Various starches of mediocrity to help fill the void.

The self serve drink station would have been the highlight of the buffet, had the ice tea not tasted like it was brewed in sink water.

1 star, only because I paid for this food, even though I'm kicking myself for it.  By the way, we went to Pink's later and got a hot dog...thank God.
