Went in friday the 22nd.  Two of us went to the bar, threw some money in the machines , not busy at all and literally watched the bartenders walk by us 10 times each before we finally flagged one down, and practically begged them to get us a drink.  One kitchen guy actually brought me a chair (the only person that actually acknowledged us or talked to us) because the one was missing). he's the only reason this review even gets one star. Needless to say after finally getting our first drink after 20 minutes we left and will not be back.  Please promote within and get rid of these bartenders with zero personality.
