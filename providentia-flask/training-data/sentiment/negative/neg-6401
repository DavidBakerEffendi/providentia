I have been coming to this restaurant for many years, and have brought many friends and groups of friends.    They have a great sushi menu, and their chefs are very nice.   Over the years I have had several friends mention that the restaurant smells bad, and I have recently noticed it starting to smell worse.  That's less than ideal for a fish and sushi restaurant.   

They do have a great menu, and the food is good.  The service is sometimes slow and it's normally very very loud when they are busy.   

Last night (Tuesday) and asked for a booth.  The host said they were going to seat me at the bar.  The restaurant was nearly empty.   Another hostess came over, and said we can seat you now at a booth but if we get busy we will move you to the bar.  I was by myself and evidently they want to keep booths for groups of people.  That is understandable I suppose, but when 80 percent of the booths were free does it matter that I wanted to sit at a booth?  She decided in her words to "just this once" sit me at a booth very rudely.   I asked her why it mattered and she said they may get busy, and said numerous times that next time I would have to sit at the bar.  It wasn't so much that they have a policy of not letting one person sit at a booth, and slow evenings, so much as how rudely they handled it.   I asked my waitress to speak to a manger. The waitress was very nice and polite, but told me the woman being rude to me was the manager.   I decided I told the waitress she didn't do anything wrong, but I wasn't going stay, and I may not come back.   

I didn't catch the managers name, but probably about 40 years old, slim, with long dark hair in a ponytail I think.  

I am torn, I do like this restaurant, and overlook the smell and poor service usually for the good selection.  I most likely won't' be back now and will need to find a go to restaurant for Sushi.
