Has your classic Towny beer smell but that doesn't bother us. We waited over 10 minutes while three bartenders and server talked to the people at the bar and no one even acknowledged us. There's really no excuse when its dead on a Sunday night only 3 tables and no employee checks on any of the tables in over 10 minutes and there are 3 dirty empty tables. Hopefully none of those employees were clocked in because none of them were doing any work!
