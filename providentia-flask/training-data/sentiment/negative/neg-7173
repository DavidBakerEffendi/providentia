Food arrived 1 hour and 45 mins late.

We called 2x

Last call we made, they hung up.

They refused to refund and take the food back.

Never buying from this place again. 

Been a loyal customer since 2012. It's not the first time  this kind of bad service  happened.

If you're reading this, any recommendation for a Chinese restaurant that provides consistently good service, and timely delivery?
