The food was plain no taste the carne sada frise was horrible, also the breakfast burrito was plain, and I hate leaving such a review. I figure it had good review that's  why I went there now put in mind it is attach to a bar when u walk in u will see the bar on the right hand side open into the restaurant, so the food more of a bar kinda food, also the reviews might be from drunk people.
