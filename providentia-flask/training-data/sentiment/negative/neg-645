I have never been here for dinner, but have been here several times for the club. I would never come back. The place is pretentious, and for no good reason. I went here on opening night, and they wouldn't let anyone in after a certain point, when the place wasn't full at all. I made the unfortunate decision of getting a booth for my birthday here, and even though I spent a couple of grand, I couldn't have been treated worse. They made me give them multiple guest lists (why couldn't they all be under my name?), and so if person X didn't show up under which I had other people, they didn't want to let those people in. They told me I would get a certain number of comps, which I didn't, so even though I spent so much money, most of my friends (not even that many) had to pay to get in. I was told that tip would not be automatically be added, but of course, I paid tax and 18% tip. On top of all that, the DJ was incompetent and didn't take requests because he obviously had a prerecorded mix. He was also rude.
