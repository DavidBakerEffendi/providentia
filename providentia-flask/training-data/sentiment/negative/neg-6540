The worst Pizza Hut we have ever been to, with the worst service. I came in to order a pizza and the person didn't seem to understand the order but said it will be ready in a little bit. I LITERALLY waited about half an hour for the pizza to be ready before they came out with the completely wrong order giving me a completely different pizza. It turns out that the person didn't even take the order right. They didn't really seem to care and made me order all over again even attempting to charge me again. After I re-ordered, again I waited about another half an hour with a different employee coming to ask us what pizza we ordered again and again. Throughout the almost 30 minutes we waited for our re-ordered pizza, all we saw were employees in the back playing around and not giving a care that they got our order wrong and made us wait so long. There was literally nobody in front checking up on us while we waited for our re-ordered pizza and instead kept asking us which one we ordered. They didn't even apologize for getting our order wrong or making us wait almost an hour at ALL throughout the whole time. A very poorly run Pizza Hut with absolute horrible service.
