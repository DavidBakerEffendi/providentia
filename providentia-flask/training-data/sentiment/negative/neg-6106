I was going to give this hotel a 2 because:

- There are tubs, but no stoppers. After asking at the front desk 3x, we told they had none. Really? After day one,  no one was authorized to pick any up.

- The absence of ice machines. I've asked 4x. The first 3x, the lobby bar tender said he'd get ice for me, which he did; but on the 4th time, I was greeted with blank stares by 4 employees who had no clue from where to get the ice. I almost told them myself when a 5th employee said he'd get me some.

- The bathroom has no place to hang your wet wash cloths.

- The room lighting is horrible. Plus, the unit windows face the parking lot, which would not be a big deal, but the parking lot is one lane from the sidewalk on Harmon. So, people are literally,  walking right outside your window. Literally!

So, since things were adding up, the rating is going down.
