Similar to other reviews, we were excited to try out Lucky Foo's, however this was not a good experience at all. 

We had reservations at 5:45 for my husband's birthday dinner (party of two) and showed up at 5:45. First, we waited several minutes for the hostess to seat one party of five, while we stood in the door with no acknowledgment. We were finally seated, where we sat for about 10 minutes without any contact. Next a server from another section said she would get our server. Mind us we are sitting at a middle table where people (staff) are walking around us constantly. Our server approaches the table @ 6:02 and we ask her for the happy hour menu, which she proceeds to tell us happy hour is over. "Well, we have been sitting here 15 minutes"...she leaves the table to do something (we were unclear) and about 4 minutes later another server put down two waters. Another 4 minutes passes, when a man (we assume it is the manager) walks by and asks if he can remove our menus that are sitting to the edge of the table. We both look at him in surprise, "sure, you can take the menus since we have never ordered." He had a look of surprise, "you haven't ordered?" At this time, we have been sitting at the table for about 22 minutes. We look at him (both very unhappy), and tell him yes you can take the menus, because we are leaving. He says, "I'm sorry" and walks away. We make our way to the door and hostess smiles and says have a good night. I stop and ask her, "who is the manager?" she says I'll get him and I say, "Oh is it the guy walking around, checking his cell phone, who watched us get up and walk out? No, we do not need to speak with him!"  And then we left. 

We were there a total of 25 minutes!
