Another issue with Ahu Tuna Salad with 2 ounces. Except THIS TIME, Manager Jeremy was not pleased with being asked to remake this item from our delivery order. Instead of making sure we had a proper salad, it was covered in won tons (we asked for none), the tuna was horribly overcooked and had fat grissle stuck to it from not allowing it to rest. The staff internationally screwed up my replacement salad as much as they could. Then Manager Brad argued with us over the status of the cooked tuna, the ounces, and whether won tons were asked for. Smh. I'm so done with this business. Such a ripoff.
