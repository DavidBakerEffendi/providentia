Last night we had a reservation at 6:15.  By 6:35 we had not even had so much as a hello from a wait staff.  We did, however, get water from a bus girl.  We left - feeling disappointed.  Went next door for Mexican instead.  It was packed - and we did not see a single table get waited on in 20 minutes.  Gave up!
