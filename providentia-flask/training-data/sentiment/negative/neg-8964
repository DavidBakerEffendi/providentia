The food was mediocre, however the manager and counterman were extremely rude. We ate dinner and wanted to buy a chicken soup to go. We ordered it from the counterman and as I don't like vegetables I asked him if he could do his best to not get too many in my order. He rudely told me he could not do that. We said that our waitress had done a great job of that. The manager than rudely ran over yelling that the waitress could be fired for that and we should never ask again. I did not realize what a crime it was to ask them to go light on the veggies. Then when we were paying the bill (the manager is also the cashier) he told me that this was the owners wishes. I said the owner was an idiot for not trying to please his customers and the battle escalated from that. There are many restaurants competing for my $ in vegas, there is no need to go where you are treated rudely.
