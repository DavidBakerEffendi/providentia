I don't believe reviews of private membership establishments should be included in your reviews. I have lived in Aurora for almost sixty years and consider my few dining experiences at The Barn of Walden as very special as are the friends who provided me with those experiences, but, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone because all but an elite few must be excluded for they are not eligible to dine there. I am sincere in my compliments for The Barn but this is my opinion based upon my wonderful times there and my inability to return unless I have a "special" friend who "belongs". Thank you, Mrs. Bonnie Charvat
