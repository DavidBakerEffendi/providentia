Came here for dinner with my husband to be greeted by two snobby hosts who were more concerned about eating and texting rather than help customers.  One of the hosts kept taking bites off a plate in a corner behind the host stand which totally grossed me out, not to mention unsanitary.  I don't think the health department would approve either.  The other host literally kept texting the whole time we were waiting to be seated, if you see this review PUT YOUR PHONE IN YOUR CAR!!!!  I'm sure your boyfriend can wait till you get off to tell you he loves you 15 times.  UNPROFESSIONAL.  Food was blah, service mediocre, bill 65, think I'll head over to olive garden next time.  I did enjoy the wine 1 Star for that...
