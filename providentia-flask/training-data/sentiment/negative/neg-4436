Service here was terrible. We are a party of 12  celebrating a birthday and our waitress couldn't even offer us a glass of water until we flagged her down and asked for drinks and sushi menus. I mean this is a sushi place right!!!!! Negative experience, the customer service was uncomfortable from the start. Won't recommend this place to anyone nor will I be back here
