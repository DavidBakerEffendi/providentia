Bad, just bad all around.  Went there for a quick bite before the show. Told bartender and she said no problem.  Orders right away and food took 30+ minutes for sliders, fries, and fried pickles. 

Sliders:
Burnt to a crisp, like eating charcoal briquettes. My girlfriend actually refused to eat them. 

Fried Pickles:
So salty we both couldn't stand them and I'm a put salt on everything person

Fries Basket:
Not bad, but were served room temp
