I have been coming to subway for a while and I eat different types of sandwiches and one of those is the tuna. With the tuna the freshness is a hit or miss. I went into this location and asked the employee is it fresh? He responded "yes"  It was my first time asking but my last time eating subway I had a "fishy old" taste and I didn't want a repeat of that. I ate most of my sandwich each bite convincing myself that the tuna aftertaste is normal and yes the mayo mix they make it with will make all better , but I was wrong. Halfway through i thought maybe i could put Chipotle sauce to mask the rankness.  best thing is the ice tea I'm gulping down right now to take the aftertaste away. So I ask the employee how many days is this tuna. He said 3 days!!!! Have you ever had tuna after 2 days? It gets fishy fish ranky rankness. I need that made daily tuna in my life! For a company that prides themselves as fresh step your game up subway your better then that!!
