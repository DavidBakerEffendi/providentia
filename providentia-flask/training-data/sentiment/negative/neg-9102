Ordered take out from them today and I never received my order! I was told it would be delivered with in 45-50 minutes. An hour passed by, no order, I called and they apologized for the delay but their driver was just leaving. Another hour passes by, I called again - the line was busy. I called back, they hung up the phone. I called again to explain the situation, was told they would look into it and they would call back. Needless to say, I never heard back from them.
