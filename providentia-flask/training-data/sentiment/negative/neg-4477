Service was great, they had real Mexican beverages but the food was terrible. My food was pure mush, like baby food. The cheese dip tasted good but it was so runny. I got what I'm pretty sure was the supreme enchiladas. 1 chicken, 1 ground beef, one bean, one cheese. It had red sauce, everything covered in shredded lettuce. All the food was very very bland. I would never go back. The place was clean and I liked the decor, maybe I would go for drinks chips and salsa, but that's it.
