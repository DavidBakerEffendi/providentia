I recently went for my nieces birthday. It was my first time at the restaurant and my last. It took over 30 minutes for the waitress to even come back with our beverages. Our Chef did not come out until about 45 minutes after. However, that was not the issue the issue was the shrimp. A few of us ordered shrimp and I noticed right away that a majority of my shrimp was not deveined properly. I brought to the attend of others in our party. I decided to just not eat the shrimp and to not make a fuss about it. Someone else in our party decided to let the manager know. Long story short, the manager claimed that that is how they serve their shrimp and that is she didn't like it to not order it on her next visit. After hearing that I decided that I would not be returning to Akira. Their service is lacking and the food in my opinion was not that great.
