This place was so adorable from the outside so we had very high hopes. From the moment we stepped in we were made to feel uncomfortable by every member of the staff. We informed our server when we sat that we were catching up so needed some time to look at the menu. She must've came back to our table 20 times, each time more annoyed than the last. When we were finally ready to order, she told us that we couldn't get entrees due to a wine tasting in the other room. Maybe she could've told us that sometime in the 30 minutes we had been there. Then I told her I wanted my salad first and she said that would hold up everyone else's food and that theirs would get cold. When we got our food, she never came to check back, which if she had she would've been told almost everyone's food was luke warm at best. She acted annoyed with us the entire time we were there. Will not be returning.
