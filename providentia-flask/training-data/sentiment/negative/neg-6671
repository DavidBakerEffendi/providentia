I am a fan of spicy ramen but was a huge disappointment for the whole experience.

Someone mentioned before the broth has no depth and I totally agree.

The fatty pork was cold for the ramen and the ground pork was plain....

I had a sip of the broth and just don't want to bother to finish the rest.
