If you are disabled and have a service dog, do not bother coming here. They don't understand the law and you have to argue it over and over as a new employee comes up and starts it all over again. My wife and I are both in wheelchairs and our service dog has a vest that clearly marks her. She's extensively trained. It should be obvious. We've been here numerous times over 5 years and the new management are clueless. They've lost our business and we highly urge others disabled people to avoid them.
