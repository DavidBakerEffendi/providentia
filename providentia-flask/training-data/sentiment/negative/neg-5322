**Closed it's doors! Can't imagine why!**

Who runs out of sushi rice and stays open? This place! Who lets you order a bottle of wine before telling you they're not serving sushi anymore because they ran out of rice? This place! This is second time this has occurred here! And they still charged us for the wine! I don't know if they now have a new manager but I'm done and never coming back! Paid $28 for a $10 bottle of wine that should have been comped because their poor managerial skills. Next time, tell people coming in the door you're out of sushi rice! Definitely not the place I reviewed last year when they first opened!
