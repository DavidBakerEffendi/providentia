I wish I had read some of the more recent reviews more closely. I decided to go to SEH because of their outdoor deck and I really like Fish n Chips. The weather is great but the service mediocre at best. I ordered a salad and the Fish n Chips. As I waited for a long time for the salad I realized that the salad would likely come out with the entree: BINGO! The waitress brought them together and placed them on my table. 

I told her the salad shouldn't be served with the Fish n Chips and she told me that's how the kitchen put them up for her. I said they know better and so should you. I asked her to remove the salad. Five minutes later she came back and told me the salad had been taken off my check. REALLY??? Did they think I'd consider paying for a salad I sent back? 

I told her if someone cared they would have come out to talk to me. No one cared or came. 

Food 3, service 1....for me that's 1 star and I won't be back.
