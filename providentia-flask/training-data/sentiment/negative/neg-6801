I love Chipotle and have always had a great experience except for at this location. I asked for sliced avocado and they looked at me like I just requested a live chicken.  The clerk told me they dont do that ..they only have the guacomole..I said dont you make the guacomole fresh from Avocados...she said yes..I said then please get an avocado and slice some of it for me..she said she is not allowed to do that...she instead offered to sell me an entire avocado and told me I would have tp slice it myself.  I asked the cashier the same question and the original clerk leaned over and said ...thats what I told you....not very pleasant ......
