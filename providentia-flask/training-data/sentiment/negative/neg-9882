We came for a late lunch today and I would rather have had cup a noodle. We were seated immediately but then waited about 15 minutes before anybody greeted us at our table. If they were busy I could have understood but there was only 2 other people in the restaurant. Once the server arrived with water we were notified that they lost their liquor license. Oh well hot on cold day will work. We ordered a few appetizers to start and they were not good. The egg rolls were cold and tasted like they were made yesterday and crispy tofu was grossly under cooked and not crispy. I returned the egg rolls and they brought me back another order in 10 seconds. Can you say not fresh! 
If McDonalds made egg rolls, they would taste better than these. 

Next was the Pho which was okay. One order had a lot of beef and the other had very little.  The broth was good but the meat is supposed to be served rare and you could tell it had been extremely over cooked. Check please!

I will not be going back. If you are looking for good Pho go to Bowl of Pho in Beachwood.
