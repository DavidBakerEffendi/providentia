Worst service ever! We sat waited almost 15 minutes for our drinks waitress said she forgot and than after she finally got our drinks a minute later our whole order arrived even though we wanted our salad first, she brought the pizzas too! The table behind us the gentleman got up to remind her about their drinks too, she must of been having a really bad day to forget 2 tables at same time  when there are only a total of 4 tables with customers , also the cooks where cursing in Spanish is kind of sad I really like Sammy's I think I'll opt for a different location and hope for the best!


I received a message from the manager and they are correcting things! I will return to this location and give them another shot! They show care and concern about their customers that's what Vegas is all about ! Thanks for the quick response and taking the time to repair the situation
