I love this food but this location is always disgusting. They have dirty tables, dirty drink fountain areas, dirty windows in the line to place orders, and flies. The last time we came here we walked out because there were no clean tables and the location was pretty empty. I would just go somewhere else because it's the same story each time we have gone there in the last year.
