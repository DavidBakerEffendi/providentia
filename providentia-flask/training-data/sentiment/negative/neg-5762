I really was excited for this place to open.  Looked like it was going to have great ambiance and an awesome menu PLUS the new bar for Univ of Arizona Game Watches... amazing!  Turns out I was completely wrong.  I never tried the food because in the hour I was there, the hummus I ordered never came.  The burgers we were going to order also didn't come because the server barely came back enough times for us to place that order.  It took OVER 45 minutes to get one beer.  The best part is after I told the server to cancel our next round, the manager came over to apologize and said he wanted to make it right.  We stuck around for another 15 mins watching him NOT get us our beers, not rush out our food or assist in any other way.  Worst service and worst management I have seen in a very long time.  We will not be back.
