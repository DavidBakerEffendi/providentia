Keep your eyes open when eating Pitas from Pita Jungle.  Just received an order through Door Dash and the two Pitas that I received with my Hummus order were moldy.  It really kills your appetite when this is the first thing you see and you're about to dig into a meal.  I also typically love their Mahi dish, but this serving was dry and over cooked.  What a disappointment.
