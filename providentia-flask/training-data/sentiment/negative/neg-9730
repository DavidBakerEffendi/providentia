If you love waiting 45 minutes for a table for horrible service and mediocre, overpriced Italian food, then this is the place for you.  The staff loves to keep people waiting for appearances, even when the restaurant is empty.  The last time we were there, we waited almost a half an hour for a patio table.  80% of the patio tables were empty and most of the staff was standing around with nothing to do.  The host finally came back to us after 20 minutes of waiting and said, "You guys wanted a patio table right?"  "Yeah,"  "Ok, it'll just be a few more minutes," with no explanation.  We just got up and left and haven't been back since.

Don't bother.  There are too many other options in the area with better food and service, as well as shorter wait times.
