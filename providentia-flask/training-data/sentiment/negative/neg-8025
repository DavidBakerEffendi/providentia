I wish I had given this place ZERO ratings. This is the most terrible experience I have had in a place in my entire stay in the US of 12 years. The first time I felt I was being treated less than a human being based on my racial background and ethnicity. All because they don't want to serve someone who isn't of their "ilk". 

I had placed order from this place several times before this incident happened, and never had an issue. However, I think they have started hiring some felons and criminals which shows in the way they treat their customers. If you wish to be served terrible pizza by people who can be counted among the "dregs" of the society along with a good old bit of old school racism, this is the place to get your pizza.
