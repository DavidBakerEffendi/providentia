Wow does the service at this location suck. Every other cafe rio in the valley that I have eaten at always taste better and always have everything ok the menu. This location seems to never have pico or limes or juices or fresh meat. The Mexican lady who I assume is a manager is completely unqualified for her position and shows no smart or common sense when talking to people. Idiots.
