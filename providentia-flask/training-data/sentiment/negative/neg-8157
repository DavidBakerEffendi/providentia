The waitress was very rude. I guess she didn't like the fact that I was speaking English? Whatever it was she had RBF. The crepes were extremely poor. Who puts a sweet Bechamel sauce on a savory crepe? After she forgot the ham on mine, she became super nice, then told me she tried to take off the entire crepe from the bill but they wouldn't let her. My girlfriend ordered the same and ate half because she was hungry. Why should we buy food just to be full? We were expecting to enjoy the crepes. Maybe we should've tried sweet crepes because the savory seemed too difficult for the chef. Don't go with high expectations.
