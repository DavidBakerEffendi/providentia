Horrible service right off the bat. Bartenders all sitting down and drinking. Employees made our table of 8 go up to the bar and get our own drinks. They only had four menus. We never got our food order taken and were actually relieved due to the fact that it probably would have taken 2hrs to get the food. My seven friends and I will never be back, and will definitely spread the awful news. Joe, I hope you read this and fix your crappy bar!!
