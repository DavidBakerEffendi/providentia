I heard great things about this place but I don't know what happen Saturday night when I went. 

First off, we sat at a table and slowly waiting for our friends to come. We ordered lots of drinks and they were all so weak. One of my whiskey sours tasted only like lemonade and I had to complain. Our server was very nice and attentive. Except the fact later on in the night, one of her nipples were showing! 

Another thing, we ordered Jameson shots chilled. I think they forgot about our shots because it took forever for it to come. After we took them, it seriously tasted like water and Jameson. Gross. 

Now then bartenders could be a little more nicer and help out people that are on the other side of the bar. We were at the bar and it was so hard to flag down a bartender just to cash out! 

Overall, I wasn't pleased and don't think I'll be returning.
