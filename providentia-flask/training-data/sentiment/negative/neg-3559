Food is amazing, but service so bad. My mom and i went and the girl that was at the register had the worst attitude, and had horrible customer service. It's not that hard doing math. Also, someone on line was told to get guacamole, so the girl did and she dropped some on the table, and put it in the customers container! No gloves, and a health hazard/cross contamination. Just horrible in general.
