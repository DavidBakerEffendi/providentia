The delivery I ordered was TERRIBLE!!!!!! Don't eat here I got a Greek salad and they gave me lettuce, tomato, and onion. What kind of Greek salad is that?!?!?! That's not Greek salad. I ordered baked ziti too which didn't have the meat sauce, ricotta cheese, or the tomato sauce in it. This had to have been some type of cruel joke. It was just pasta with cheese baked on top of it. I called them to tell them about the trash food they had me wait 45 minutes for, they said they would deliver another order in 45 minutes. WHY WOULD I WANT ANOTHER ORDER OF THIS?!?!?! I demanded my $26 back I will never eat any of their food ever again this is unacceptable.
