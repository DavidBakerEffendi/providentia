I went into Angelina's Pizza & Returaunt, for the second time , there food is delicious however there customer service is horrible. From the minute that I walked in the door there was no acknowledgement or welcoming, front the  counter females they lack in customer service and are abrupt unprofessional. Smoking right out front of your business is such a turn off. These are not the people that I want handling my food. Just a word of advice To the owner of the company you should train your staff or hire people whom are qualified to run your business. You have outstanding food but your employees are not great !!!
