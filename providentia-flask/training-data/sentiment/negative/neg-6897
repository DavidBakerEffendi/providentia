My boyfriend and I were looking to switch things up for breakfast this past Sunday. We'd passed by BLD a few times before and thought we'd give it a try. The atmosphere is hip enough, and it seemed pretty decently busy. My boyfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy while I ordered the traditional breakfast of scrambled eggs, wheat toast, bacon, and I ordered a pancake instead of the breakfast potatoes. First time around, my eggs were cold. Very cold. I informed my waitress who had them remade for me. Honestly, I would rather eat eggs from Denny's than eggs from BLD. They were watery and flavorless no matter how much salt and pepper I added. The toast came buttered but with no jam or jelly brought to the table. Bacon was fine as it's pretty hard to mess up bacon. The pancake was large, but really just sort of "meh". Nothing too terribly exciting. As for the biscuits and gravy, the entire dish reeked of onion. The onion flavor was so strong that it completely overpowered any other flavors that could have been present. Finding his dish inedible, we left having eaten between us a piece of toast, half a pancake, and bacon. Perhaps the food for lunch and dinner is better, but I don't think neither my boyfriend of myself care to find out. Overall, the atmosphere is nice, but the food was awful. We won't be returning.
