looking forward to a Dave's hot and juicy bacon deluxe...
  this place DOES NOT DO IT!!!!!!!!!  the workers said the franchise owner does not want to "get the toaster"  W.T.H???, then DONT place all the signs up saying that the buns are toasted butter.. they were COLD and blah... crap is what it was!!! 
 I will be calling the Wendy's people because this does not look good on them, i had to turn around from the DT and get a refund.. the burgers were sad,  
 now i dont want to even wast my time going to other Wendy's locations knowing that they might not have the advertized items, it is not worth my time to check.. and if they have signs up ALL over the place and national advertizing ... then make it like it should be... i guess not it is A&W for FF... 
sad ... really sad :(
