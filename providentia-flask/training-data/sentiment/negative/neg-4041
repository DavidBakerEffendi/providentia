Came here on Thanksgiving Day, the line was ridiculous. Again, what else do you expect ? dining  on Thanksgiving Day. Thankfully, we had a Noir Mlife card which allowed us to go straight to the front of the line. The service was great, but the food quality was not as great as it used to be. I am still a fan of Bacchanal buffet!
