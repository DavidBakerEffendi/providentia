This is one of the worst restaurants I have been to, the atmosphere was nice, but the food was terrible! I ordered the Mediterranean salad ($8.99) + i think $2.49 for added chicken or shrimp, and i chose blackened chicken. My boyfriend ordered the Pistachio crusted  salmon, which he described as flavorless and that the salmon tasted like a greasy piece of fish with some pistachios thrown on top. I believe it was like $13 or 14.99. My salad was small, and oddly enough it came with a freakin muffin? Not to mention the muffin was the BEST thing i tasted in there....sad,but true, the blackened chicken was the smallest little diced cubed up chicken pieces i have EVER seen, it didn't even taste as if it was blackened. The greens were wilted, and usually a $12 salad anywhere ya go is a good salad with a nice pieces of chicken cutlet, and our server was trying her  best, but came off as annoying to us unfortunately. We also ordered the appetizer of the crab fritters, i think like $5.99- and it was not great, the crab tasted old....This came off as one of those restaurants that want merely nothing but your money, the food isn't authentic whatsoever and the servers look as if they could care less..I will never be coming back to this place
