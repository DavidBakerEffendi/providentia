Called in to make a reservation for 8:00. We showed up 10 minutes early and they hadn't put us on the list. Miles was the one who took the reservation. Then they tell us that they didn't put us (my hubby, 2 kids and myself) on the list. They tell us that we can wait 10 minutes for a table then they will start cooking in a half an hour. I wasn't happy with this since we have two elementary age children but what could we do? We chose to stay as the kids were looking forward to it. We waited 10 minutes and the assistant manager comes back and says "yeah so it's going to be a ridiculous length of time. At least an hour or so" no real apology. Not willing to do anything to make up for their error. I had a Groupon and was told I could call to take care of getting my money back. I ask to speak to a manager. Assistant manager comes back out and says he's too busy to speak with us and it will be 10-15 minutes so I say we'll wait and he again goes back and comes back and says "it's going to be a really long time" and explains that he's the assistant manager and asks how he can help... we ended up leaving with disappointed kids, no solution and needing to figure out where to spend our money. Well 5 miles away, Hon machi is the way to go and we spent our $200 there. At least we spent our time at a place with good service, great food, and a great show. Considering going some place that they actually appreciate your business.
