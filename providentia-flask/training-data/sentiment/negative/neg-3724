This place is the worst, service sucked first and then they were out of ingredients at open. My visit was right after open and at the beginning of lunch hours. They were out of chicken and the features pizza was Thai chicken. I, being a vegetarian, order the Thai chicken without chicken. The rude employee talks me out of my order based off not having chicken. I ordered anything that was left, no olives because they were out. This was a terrible experience.
