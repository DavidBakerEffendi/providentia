The bouncers at this place are AWFUL. I mean disrespectful to women all around! I was here a few weeks ago and got a call so I walked outside, leaving my friends in the bar. When I went to re-enter the bouncer physically pushed me (I'm a 5'2 small woman) and told me I was too drunk (I hadn't been drinking that night at all). He made me wait outside for an hour before I could go back in and there was no line what so ever. He also called me every name in the book when I told him I would report him on Yelp. Very professional. I will absolutely never be returning and will be telling all my friends that play in spring training.
