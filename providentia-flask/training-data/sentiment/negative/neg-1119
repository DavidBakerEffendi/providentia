Our plans changed on valentine's day so we drove around. Wanted boiling crap but it was too busy. We ended up here. Wasn't busy at all. Got sat down. Ordered food. Our waiter took couple tries to get our order correct.  Should write it down if you're having a hard time remembering. 
Got our order. There were couple shrimps in the batch that seemed really old and nasty. Still I wasn't dissapointed. It can happen right?
Finally in the middle of our dinner I found a cockroach next to me on the bench seat. Didn't wanna cause a scene, quietly got an employees attention to get it away. Towards the end I think the  owner came up to me and told me sorry and that it's hard to totally eliminate the bug problem. Told them it was ok.
When we finally got the bill they still charged us full price. I should've been comped ice tea, steam rice and maybe corn. Those items are really nothing for them. Just saying.
