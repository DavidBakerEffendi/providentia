Despite the large number of negative reviews, I had high hopes for Buzios.  The menu looked interesting and, walking past it in the Rio, it appears to be an upscale restaurant.  Unfortunately, it was an overpriced, poorly run tourist trap.  On my visit last night, the broiler and deep fryer weren't working, so half of the menu items were unavailable, something that wasn't told to me until after I had made a reservation, after I had been seated and after the wine I ordered had been opened.  Some additional items that required neither frying nor broiling were also unavailable.  When my wife and I found some dishes that were available and placed our order, we had a 50 minute wait before my order was served.  It would be another 10 minutes before my wife's meal arrived.  My red snapper was very overcooked and the Hollandaise sauce and mashed potatoes had a crust on them, indicating they had spent much more than a fleeting moment under the heat lamps.  It was something you'd expect at a roadside diner.  My wife's shrimp, fortunately, were better.  It's normal practice for a waiter to ask about your meal shortly after serving it.  At Buzios, the servers don't ask  -  they already know the answer.  That's a hint.  Other than the bread, which was excellent, it was a miserable dining experience.  With so many better choices available, there's no sane reason to go to Buzios.
