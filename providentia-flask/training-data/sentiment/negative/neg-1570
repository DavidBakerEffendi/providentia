I tried to get service of this place. I'm not sure why the attendant ignored me standing in front of him. I wanted to enjoy the market and grab a bite. After being deliberately ignored (I.e. Serving 3 customers before me that arrived after me) I left. Discrimination may be the case, I'm not sure if it's cause I'm a minority or not local. Surely, I'm not a person who wishes ill on others but I hope this place goes out of business. 

I do not recommend this place and avoid it. To support discrimination does not bold well with my meal.
