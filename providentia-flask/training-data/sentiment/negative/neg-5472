It had a dirty sticky feel but that could be because it was sticky, I had the hardest time getting my shoe off the floor. The Pho was watered down and seriously lacking in flavor. The bun salad had a strange taste but I am pretty sure that it has something to do with the aerosol air freshener pointed at the table. The gentleman working was very unfriendly and left us feeling like  we were bothering him when I asked for a drink but in all honesty at that point my water had been empty for 10 minutes before I asked. We only went because our normal place was closed for the night but we will definitely not make the same mistake again.
