I'm normally a very patient person when it comes to service. I don't mind waiting for my food, even longer than normal, and I'm not difficult to please when it comes to the taste of said food I am waiting on. It takes a lot to irk me when being waited on. Having said that, I was plenty irked by the time we left Duggan's. I would say I was at a maximum irk level. 

Here's why. 

The place was incredibly understaffed and even though the place wasn't full, one waitress can not take on that many tables, which is why we were treated more like an inconvenience than customers. 

Our drink order came about 25 minutes after ordering. When I finally decided to have a drink as well and wait another 20 minutes for a scotch on the rocks, it was plunked in front of me with no ice. I decided not to inconvenience the waitress and go to the bar to ask for ice in my glass where the bartender looked at me like I had some form of leprosy, and chucked a couple of cubes in my glass. 

I had the veggie burger, and while Toronto restaurants never usually disappoints with vegetarian fare, Duggan's completely underwhelmed me with a falling apart, bland, cold veggie burger. I had to go to Harvey's right after to satiate the craving I had all day of looking forward to a good veggie burger. If Harvey's can do it better, you need to figure out how to step is up a notch, especially for $12.

We then waited another 45 mins to pay our bill at which point we just had to get up and stand close to the pay station. 

I can't entirely blame the waitress for the lack of service; poor management was the obvious culprit behind our experience, topped with expensive, lackluster food and a rocks-less scotch. Will not be back.
