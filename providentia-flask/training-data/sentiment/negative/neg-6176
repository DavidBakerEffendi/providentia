They were busy for UFC 208. The bartender sold me on getting the pizza bread 'souped' up in her words, and punched in the wrong order. That's fine I get it. She's busy mistakes happen. The manager stared at me after she clearly told him what happened. He stared blankly at me and didn't even come to apologize for the mistake. I'm not the type to look for anything to be free but the gesture would have been nice. 

I'm currently in the service industry myself and I can tell you right now that this has been the worst management I have seen in while. Further more the restaurant I work at is twice the size of this place. Disappointed since BP is from my home town.
