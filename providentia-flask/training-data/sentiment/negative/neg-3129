My daughter and I visited the 1795 Snow Rd Parma, OH 44134 location at approximately 7:15 am on Saturday 8/11. We frequent this location a couple times a month, and usually have no issues, until this visit. We walked in and stood at the counter waiting for an employee to greet us, after about 2 minutes someone in the kitchen said someone will be with you. Paige came out. She looked like she was either throwing up or had dysentery and shouldn't be working. She was unable to concentrate. My daughter asked for an Iced coffee, the container was not dated (A food safety violation BTW) the other employee said it was 2-3 days old. We got regular coffee. our food was cold, I used purell after we sat as I did not want to get whatever Paige had. Other customers came in and left as she was not paying any attention to them, it was not good. She should have called off. I wrote to Burger King and have gotten no response. hmmm
