Never come to this place ever ever again. Highly UNrecommended. This is the worse Chinese restaurant I've seen in my life. Extremely bad service. The waitress face was like someone dead. When writing order, she just want to rush you complete the order and very unprofessional. 
Food wise, the bbq pork meat looks like cooked and sit here for a long time. The ribs are in giant pieces and majority of them are bone. The vegetables are not fresh. 
Overall, One star is way too much for this restaurant. What a joke!
