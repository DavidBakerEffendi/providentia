Stopped in here for lunch last week.  The nicest person was the hostess.  Our waiter Joe did not even tell us his name and was not at all personable but rather kind of rude.  I think the owner needs to decide if she wants this place to be upscale or a sports bar as there are 6 tvs over the bar.  There is really nothing special about the food.  Everything is pretty much overpriced expect about $30 per person just for lunch.  The salad we ordered was nothing special and salads are better at sweet tomatoes or any other place.  The prime rib dip we ordered which we were told would be a foot long actually was only 6 inches and again nothing special but rather very boring.  The ladies bathroom had nice wooden doors and cool ceiling but the tile floor makes it dingy and dirty looking. The blue and silver decor inside the dining hall is real nice and different.  We wanted to like it but with a rude waiter plus boring & overpriced food is not a place for us to go back.  It was nice to try.
