I've been here quite a few times. I gave this place a chance, I really did. 6+ visits. It seems like a diamond in the rough and that it would of become my new favorite Thai spot, but there are many reasons that this place is lacking, and is best avoided.

The first impression of this place was good, it had nice decor and seemed like a very good menu. The Pad Thai is the only good thing I've ever tried here though, the curry is too watery, the tofu too over fried, and there's more onions than anything in the vegetable dishes. One time our rice was even burnt to crunchiness, ew.

While that put me off in all of itself, the tipping edge of never returning here is the rude server we seem to always get. Most of the waitresses are nice, but there's always this one waitress(maybe waiter, she sounds like a man) that is rude as all hell when we visited here. She's not friendly to the customers, and slams food and glasses around. Like shit dude, if you don't like your job go get another one and quit making everyone else miserable. 

While I'll miss the Pad Thai, I'll be finding another Thai spot to replace this horrible restaurant.
