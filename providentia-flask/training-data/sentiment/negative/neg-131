Ordered and paid for my food then waited near the cash for over 15 minutes before I asked someone where my food was. They "forgot" my order even though I had just paid for it...

They hastily made my meal and when I was ready to leave, the guy behind the cash hands me a receipt for me to pay, even though we had just, not 10 mins before, gone over the fact that I had paid and they forgot my order... 

The food is greasy and just what I needed but these guys are idiots....
