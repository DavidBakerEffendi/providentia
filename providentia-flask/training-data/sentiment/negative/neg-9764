On saturday march 4th we went here with a group of 11 people, so not huge. I called before asking if i need reservations and the gentleman said no, but he will put together a table for 11 people as i asked. On the phone it sounded very nice, and the gentleman was polite and engaging. Well when we got to the restaurant the first person that we saw was a pregnant woman which was surprised that we had a party of 11, and didnt know what to do. She left us not saying anything and we were wondering whats going on, until a nice gentleman came and sat us down. For sure that's not a great way to start lunch at a restaurant in Scottsdale. At the table, our server came and not even saying her name or even greeting us, she started to put napkins on the table and then asked us what we want to drink but she looked like she hated her life. Sure enough when we started to ask question about the menu and the food on the menu she was answering like she didn't want to talk to us. Besides all this we were maybe 10 min before happy hour and we asked if we can have a menu or order off the happy hour, but our waitress started an explanation that she has to put in now and we have to wait until 3 pm even though we weren't far away from 3pm when happy hour starts. The food was alright not the best, the chicken in my pastas could've been more cooked and not left raw, also there can be put more chicken not just 8 to 10 pieces. Overall the experience at a restaurant from Scottsdale was awful and i will probably not go again to this italian restaurant. It is lacking in customer service like no other, and for customers matters how you are treated, which that results in people coming back and telling their friends good things about the restaurant. But i will for sure not come here anytime soon, maybe never.
