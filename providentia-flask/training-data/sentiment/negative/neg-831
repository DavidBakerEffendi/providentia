I really enjoy Wendy's burgers, poutine and the spicy Ceasar salad.  For a fast food restaurant, Wendy's is up there for me due to the variety of food they offer.  However, this location is a total letdown.  It is staffed by not so smart people, that would be the nicest way to put it.  I ordered a deluxe cheeseburger on two different occasions, and when I received my order, both times they gave me a plain old hamburger.  By the time I got home, I was in no mood, both times, to drive back and exchange the wrong order.  I know they say fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.  But come on, how hard is it to figure out a cheeseburger has cheese? And a deluxe cheeseburger has more than ketchup? Plus, there's a price difference between the two, I totally got gypped.  Boo to the management team here.
