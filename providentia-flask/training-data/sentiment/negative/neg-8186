1. coffee warm, not hot.
2. Both of us ordered potatoes crispy; one came regular and one well done - had to send back.
3. GLASS IN WAFFLE when i bit into it!!!!!!
Credited this breakfast, not the coffee, ruined our breakfast, should have credited the $18.00.  Glass in the waffle!  At least they acknowledged that something broke in the kitchen.
