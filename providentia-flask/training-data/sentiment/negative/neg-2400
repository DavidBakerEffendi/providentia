This location is the closest to where I work and is on my way home for my lunch break. Service at this location is extremely slow and placing an online order hardly remedies the situation. Numerous times have I arrived after the scheduled pick up time to find out my order is not ready and will take an additional 10 to 15 minutes. I don't recommend coming here if you're in a rush.
