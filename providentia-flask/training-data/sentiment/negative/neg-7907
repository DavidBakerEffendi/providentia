The Staff at this location was very rude from the beginning but I decided to give them the benefit of doubt and continued to proceed, then the guy behind the counter started acting pushy about ordering rushed me to pick something fast just to get me out of his way then after ordering the food he continuously harassed me about siting at a table, ok so I said at least I get food, it was terrible I mean I got a kebab plate and everything was bad the beef was probably not beef I don't know tasted terrible and bad texture, the rice tasted like cardboard, so I stopped eating and left my plate full thinking I would get asked about the food but they didn't care the guy picked up my plate full and dumped it with no question, inconsiderate  of them I just paid for what he just dumped in the trash.
