Without meaning to sound harsh, yet wanting to sound honest. This is by far the worse Chinese food I've tasted in Montreal. I've had my fair share of Chinese dishes in China Town, Montreal and even a hole in the wall is better than Imperial Palace. 
I went at 7:00pm on a Tuesday, only one table was there. Which left soon after we arrived. I was hoping more people would come, yet by 9:00pm, we were still the only ones here.
The owner/waiter greeted us politely, but with horrible jokes. 
Having been in Asia for a month, not a single of their dishes were typically Chinese. They were cheaply, tasteless, poorly prepared dishes. Without ordering the most expensive dishes, our total cost for three dishes two drinks, was $70.00. Without any wine.  When in all honesty I've had far better Dim Sum for three people at the cost of $30.00
Our General Tao chicken, was soggy, dripping in grease and sauce. The chicken pieces were tiny!
The fried rice with vegetables, was crunchy. Yes, including the rice. An absolute disappointment. 
In the middle of Winter, the parking lot was a complete ice skating rink!! Not a drop of salt was used. 
This is simply my opinion, yet my suggestion would be, don't eat here. Save yourself money and have better food at China Town.
