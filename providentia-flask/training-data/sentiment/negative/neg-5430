Similar to other bad experiences.  Didn't feel welcome in the store.  Made it as far as the bakery when baker-service-person came around, reached around us (with nary an "excuse me) grabbed a cake and went into the back.  No "hello" no "be right with you."  After feeling ignored for long enough we just left.  Can find what we need at plenty of other places in any event.
