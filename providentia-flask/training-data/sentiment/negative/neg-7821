Went to TRH for the very first time, 7/16/16.  Country Western theme. Server, was Morgan. She was very attentive and polite! The issue, everyone at my table had, was EVERY item of food we ordered, was Super Salty!!! The Steak, Cheesy Bacon Fries, Sauteed Mushrooms, String beans, Rice...everything. It pretty much, killed the excitement of eating there.  I let the waitress know, as we were pretty much packing up the food to take home AND get all the salt off....NOW, don't get me wrong, ME LOVE the salty stuff. But, it was even too much for me! And she said, they use a kosher or Sea Salt...but, didn't take out complaint, any further or advised she would bring that to the attention of the mgr or kitchen...so, for that...I give 1Star.  The menu is, really good, but if you need to watch your blood pressure, may not want to eat here..And, the music is LOUD...and, YES I still hit The Clubs. But, when I'm trying to eat....ugg
