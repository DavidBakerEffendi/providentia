This is the worst location in Las Vegas. I literally called my order in (enchilada burrito and guacamole) 15 minutes before I arrived. When I got there I had to pay immediately and literally stood there for an additional 15 minutes while I watched 10 other people get their food. When the takeout girl finally asked about my order it had been laying there already for God knows how long. No apology.. the service is horrible and the whole restaurant is disorganized. Thumbs down!
