Third visit, and I  left without eating. A testament to how clueless some establishments can be regarding their guests. After I sat at the bar, asked for a menu and water (neither were offered), I was never approached again. Portraying all of the obvious signs of being ready to order, menu down, trying to make eye-contact, for 10 minutes-- not exaggerating here-- 10 full minutes, the bartender then left the bar to get mic'ed up to do an interview! No one covered the bar while he was being interviewed. I did not stick around any longer. I am annoyed and hungry and will not return. 

The worst part is that I recommended this place for brunch to a friend last night!
