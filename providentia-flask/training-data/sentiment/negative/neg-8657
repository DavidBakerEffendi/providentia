Simply for the size of the menu the lack of Gluten Free chocolate or crepe ( rice, buckwheat, almond flour) is just a huge shame. More lactose free and gluten free options wouldn't be that hard at all.

2016- about 65% are lactose intolerant to some degree, 15% of population has gluten antibodies suspecting sensitivity and inflammation after digestion, 6% are gluten allergic intolerant sensitive because of the symptoms and some of them are completely intolerant due to celiac disease.  

City of Paris, New York, Toronto,  have gluten free options in nearly every restaurant, cafe, bakery. Crepes, cakes, pastry, chocolate, and always GF macaroons... 
Montreal restaurants are sooo behind.
