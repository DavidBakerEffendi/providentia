As a local, it saddens me to write this review.  I have been to this place on many of late night occasions and it it always busy. But on this night, the service was so horrible, we almost got up and left!  And it was only about 10pm, early for this 24/7 place. We got seated, and then watched two other tables get seated after us and orders taken, before the same server came over to us.  She apologized and said she didn't see us there.  Then we ordered three different sandwiches, nothing fancy.  She brought each sandwich out separately, and spaced enough that one person finished their food before the third person ever got theirs. We insisted that the first person eat their sandwich otherwise it would get cold. My fries were ice cold.  I had to finally flag down any server to complain.  It took too long for our server to come back over and ask what was up.  She then explained that they were busy and I should be patient.  Not what you say to hungry customers. I'm not sure I would waste my time going back here as there are sooooo many other choices in this time.  I'm sad to say The Peppermill with not be my "go to" place again.
