Waited way over 20 minutes at the drive-thru and turns out the car in front of us didn't even order where you're supposed to. The worst part is they still let them order at the window and we had to wait even longer. The drive-thru had at least 6 other cars behind us. I swear Taco Bell has gotten worse and worse every time I go. If you want something quick, I would suggest you save your time and go eat elsewhere. They also can't seem to ever get orders right either. It's no wonder why there have been a few locations that have closed down permanently. I'll just stick to better service and food over at Del Taco.
