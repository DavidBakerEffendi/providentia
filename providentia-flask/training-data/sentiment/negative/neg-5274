Okay, I get it. You're new. You're busy. What the staff lacks is teamwork.  Our waitress was slammed, but no one stepped up to help her. Waited 10 minutes to place a drink order. Another 10 minutes to place my food order. Drink was never refilled. Other wait staff standing around  literally making eye contact with me, but not looking at the table to see how they can help. Manager walking around, stops by to talk to angry customers to the right and left of me. Does he look at our empty drinks. No.  Now he's having a conversation with the angry customer to my left, just shooting bull. Wake up!  Your restaurant is slammed. Get in the weeds with them! I'll come back, but it will be months.
