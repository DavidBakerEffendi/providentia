First I was thrown off my the mobile phone sign covering the door.  Then the inside seemed over crowed with tables.  There was a little side room that had misc products form olive oil to Tide.  

I walked in today to order take out and was surprised at the $8.25 Fattoush salad.  So I decided to order a spinach pie to go.  For $2.25 I received a dry over cooked, microwaved spinach pie that was tiny- like cocktail party size.  I was very disappointed and will NOT return.  Best to stick with the Aladdin's factory on Carnegie or Oasis Bakery  on Detroit (they make the fresh spinach pie while you wait)
