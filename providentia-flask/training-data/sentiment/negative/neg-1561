Two pounds of brisket-to-go with three sides - the bill was around $60 plus bucks.
We agreed, never again - the food just isn't that good.

Fast forward six months when we get the brainstorm to only get their sides, we would bbq our own steaks and have a fast, inexpensive dinner, or so we thought.

Three sides; each a pint, the bill came to almost $30 bucks.
If you look at their menu, the sides are displayed for $2.00 each. This threw me off.
I'm guessing 2 dollars gets you a micro-side, not a real side.

Think this through for a second; a pint of beans was almost 10 bucks and they weren't even that tasty. I believe you can get four cans of S&W Chili beans (tasty) for about the same price, and with half the liquid smoke and salt content.

Collards had chunks of unrecognizable meat and were too salty to eat, not without having your own personal desalination facility with which to run them through first.

I'm not sure how the sides prices jump from $2 to $9 plus, but I'll never have to deal with it again. As I said, the food just isn't that good and the sides were way too salty.

TT; if you're going to charge Franklin's (Austin) prices, then serve up Franklin's type food.

On the bright side, it's a good place to sit and drink a beer while they wash your vehicle.
