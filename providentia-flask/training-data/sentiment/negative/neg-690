Overall: WARNING, UNETHICAL MANAGEMENT.  They do not honor paid Living Social vouchers.

Customer Service: 1 star.  The waitress was fine.  The 1 star is for the inept management.  I purchased a LivingSocial promotion of pay $20, get $30.  The promotional value expired, but the paid value doesn't expire for 5 years.  I notified the man at the counter and the waitress, and they had no issue.  As I went to pay, the man at the counter called a lady (I'm assuming the owner) to tell her about the voucher.  After 5 minutes of him arguing with her, he put me on the phone to talk to the lady.  She said that the voucher was expired and that I could not use any of it.  The voucher clearly states the paid value doesn't expire until 2019.  Again, she was on the phone arguing with me, which is crazy.  Finally they gave me the $20 off, but acted like they were doing me a favor.

Pricing: 2 stars: The sesame chicken entree was $13.95, which is the most I've ever paid.  

Food: 4 stars.  The sesame chicken was good.  Beef teriyaki sticks were excellent; best I've ever had.   They have a good selection of meals.

Appearance: 2 stars.  It's a poorly decorated restaurant.
