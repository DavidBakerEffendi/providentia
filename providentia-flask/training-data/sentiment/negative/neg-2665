oh my gosh! I ordered a sourdough chicken avacado sandwich with NO Mayo and No tomato. I get home and it is smothered in mayo and tomato. I hate mayo. I called them and they put me on a list for 2 free entrees. I go back the next day to get to Cobb Salads with NO Tomato- Get home and tons of tomatoes on both salads... Gimmie a break.... Hire someone competent to work the kitchen. I will NOT be going back!
