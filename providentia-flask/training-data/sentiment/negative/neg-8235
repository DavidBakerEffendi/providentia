I came in and I ordered 4 apple pies, cashier was professional and I received my order within 2 minutes. I found a place to sit and put in my ear buds and proceeded to eat my pies over the course of 15-20 minutes. My ride was 5 minutes away so I cleaned my area and proceeded to wait outside. 2 minutes latter a manager comes out and tells me I have 10 minutes to leave or she's gonna ruin my day and call the cops. I told her my rides on my way and I just finished eating less than 3 minutes ago. She's something about keeping the front clear and people clogging it up, but this is no way to treat a quiet paying customer. She walk 3 car spaces away from the entrance and leans on her car and lights a cigarette. One minute latter my rides there I turn to the lady and tell her to have a good night and leave. I was outside less than one song less than 5 minutes and get threatened with a cop call. I was in no way rude or lingering, I was at the restaurant less than a half hour. I ordered, got my food, sat down, ate, cleaned up and left. Nothing extra and get threatened with a cop call. I don't like that, I was respectful and quiet. I was outside less than 3 minutes before being threatened, was not standing near a door or anything just waiting looking at the parking lot for my ride.
