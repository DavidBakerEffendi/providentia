I went in at 10am this morning and I did not get any type of customer service. The employee (African American girl, some what stocky, medium lengths hair) assisted me and greated me with a "are you going to get a sandwich" assuming that anything else was out of the question for some reason. 

She did not smile, rung me up, and walked away without saying goodbye and left it to myself to grab my items that where closer to her the. They were to me.

The only way I can describe the customer service (or lack there of) is a spoiled teenager who was not happy to work there and was waiting for my transaction to be completed so she can get back to social media on her cell phone.
