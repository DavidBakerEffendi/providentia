If I could give this place a 0 star I would. When I go through the drive through, I expect my food order to be correct. How hard is it to mess up two ice cream cone orders? And because it's hot out, how hard is it to take a cone and put it upside down in a bowl so it doesnt melt all over me on my way home? 

Apparently the workers can't even fathom this crazy contraption and give me a plastic dish that's NOT what I wanted. 

Unless you want to deal with idiots don't come here. That is all.
