Where to start with this disappointing meal. The restaurant was so dark we had to use our phones to read the menu. The portions were extremely small. The crab cakes are 1 inch in diameter and a serving is 2 for $15  and lacking in flavor. The seafood trio was very small as well.  3 shrimp 2 scallops and a 2 inch piece of salmon. The risotto was soggy. The only thing that saved the meal was the grilled shrimp.  The cheeseburger was ok but nothing to write home about. To top off the evening we had very pool service. Our water was never refilled during our meal and our glasses were empty. Our server never came to check on us and we finally had to ask the hostess for our check after setting at the table for several minutes after completing our meal.  We even made it obvious by putting our plates at the end of the table. Culver's would have been a better choice tonight
