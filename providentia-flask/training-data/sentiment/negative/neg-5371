Seriously Terrible. Decided to give them another try cause I'm lazy and it's available on uber eats. With that being said got the traditional pho, the broth this time tasted bland and watery. No basil or cilantro in the veggies and the noodles were already over cooked. No hoisin, no Siracha, or chop sticks. Seriously want my money back
