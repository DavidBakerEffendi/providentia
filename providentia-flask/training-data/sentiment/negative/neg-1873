Yuck.  My chicken burrito was full of refried beans with barely a tablespoon of chicken...almost no cheese...no creative flavor.  They pass off thin ranch dressing as a salad dressing or entree topping or dip for tortilla chips. They call it something fancy but it's just ranch dressing.  Guacamole was bland. Rice was really dry. There's a handful of lettuce on the side of the plate, topped with the same salsa you get at the table. margaritas were weak and boring.  Chips were fresh and hot, though. The decor was very cute. The wait staff was nice and cooperative for our large group. However, way too expensive for the quality of the food. I can think of about five Mexican or Tex Mex restaurants in the same area of Charlotte, that are sooooo much better. This was my second trip and it will be my last.
