I am so glad we are leaving and never coming back to this place. The waiter Billy is the most obnoxious server I've ever had. Me and my girlfriend were just trying to have a small snack before heading home for the night and he keeps making awkward small talks and was incredibly racist at some points. When he asked where we were from and I told him I was from Vietnam he said that "you speak English well" - because after living in America for most of my life that would be surprising. I hope he didn't think that was a compliment because I sure don't. 

The food was average but because we felt like we were harassed by the waiter I'll never go back. He didn't even back off when we made it clear we were a couple.
