Made a to go order that cost 37$ that included the fried duck, samurai shrimp and spring rolls. The location came from just a couple blocks down from where I live. Finished a long day of work so wanted to order out. Took a hour and a half for the delivery person to arrive and I swear to you when I open the treys of food I found there were more veggies than meat. I felt like a darn rabbit!!!!
