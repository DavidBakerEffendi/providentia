I went to the Via Linda location for lunch at what I was hoping would be a new cool sandwich place.  I was greeted well and everything seemed normal until after I made my order and waited for my sandwich...and waited...and waited...and waited...I finally got my rather simply made sandwich about 30 minutes after I ordered!!!  It would have taken me less time to go to the grocery store next door, but the ingredients and make the sandwich myself!  This place really needs to get its act together about timely service.  If there is something they can learn from the larger chains, its how to get customers served in a timely manner.  Their inability to perform this simple task shows poor management or business model or quite possibly both!  I may check out the other location in the future (if I'm in that area), but as a new customer, I will not be heading back to this location. 

As for the sandwich...I ordered the pastrami sandwich and it was OK but nothing to really brag about.   The only thing that seems unique about their menu are the names for their sandwiches and not the simple sandwiches in particular.
