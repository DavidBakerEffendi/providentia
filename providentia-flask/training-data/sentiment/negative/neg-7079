Recently they have changed the coffee, this was not a Sound Decision. Somebody has fucked this up badly, I am really disappointed in this place. Of all of the things a breakfast should be good for .....COFFEE. I am sorry if you have the most amazing breakfast in the world but Nothing to drink with it what is the point.
