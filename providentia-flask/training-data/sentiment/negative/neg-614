This review is solely based on hostess service at Camelback/7st location. 

We were so hungry  and craving pasta from Oregano's. Knowing that wait can be long, we called as we were  three minutes away to make sure the wait is not going to be 40 minutes. 

The guy on the phone told me that they had several tables inside and few outside. We pulled in three minutes later and based of hostess greeting us, I should of known it will not go well. 

She takes our name, barely greeting us and does not tell us about how long the wait will be at all. I see tables outside but she is not even going to check and see if they are available. Five minutes in, we change our outside table to inside one since at this point we are not getting seated. 

She changes it without telling us again, how long the wait will be. At this point, I am super hungry and getting a little frustrated. 

I finally ask another hosted who was cheat cheating there, how long will out wait be? She tells us 20 minutes! I was so mad at that point. Empty tables, which I can see with my eyes and after ten minutes of waiting they tell me, oh the wait will be 20 minutes. The place is clearly slow. 

I know that sometimes they might not have enough chefs, servers....but please. This was such an awful experience. My time and money are imported to me as they are to everyone else and when somebody disrespects it-not good. 

We walked away, as I was not ready to leave my money there after that treatment. So sad as I wanted the pasta and I always had good service at this Camelback Oregano's! 

I recommend that hostess get some additional training on how to communicate, especially when you are working in the industry where hungry people are at your door at all times.
