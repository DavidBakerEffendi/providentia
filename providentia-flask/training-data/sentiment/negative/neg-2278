The first time I went the sandwich was delicious. This time I ordered the philly cheese steak with onions and red sauce. The chef was engrossed in getting the snack cakes they just ordered out. I get home and bit into the sandwich and realize something's missing. I look and it's just meat and cheese. I call and explain what happened and ask if I can come and get a new sandwich that I actually ordered. Now I have worked in food service and customer service for over 20 years and have never had the chef/cook get on the phone and argue about what he knows he gave me. That's what happened. He says I know what I gave you. You can add extra onions at home if you want. I told him I would happily bring the sandwich in to show him so he could see what I received. I decided to call it a loss and will never go there again thanks to having to argue about what I see as opposed to what they think I was given.
