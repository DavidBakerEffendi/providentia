The Mesquite  Grill has to be one of the worst run restaurants I have ever consistently experienced. Food quality fair at best. Service non existent at best. Now here is the perverbial straw that broke the camel's back. What restaurant goes 10 days in a row without air conditioning in June in Arizona? Answer, this one. Don't  you think Phil Mickelson, who is financially commited to this golf course restaurant, can afford a new AC unit? At this restaurant, the customer  gets a double bogey.
