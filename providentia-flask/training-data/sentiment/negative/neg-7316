We found cockroaches cooked in the Great Buns and had a cockroach run across the floor at Flamingo and Decature. I absolutely quit on them at that point. The managers don't do anything but yell at their employees. Being 100% honest with you guys trust me when I say Capriotti's has serious health problems. You're eating rat shit and cockroaches. They're "DM" Fred is too young with too much on his hands. He tried to  act like I was lying after the half cut Great Bun had a roach in it and we just wanted our money back. Seems like a bunch of kids running the store. My brother in law is the VP for Boyd Gaming and he won't recommend Cap's to anyone nor even give them a try. God forbid you go to Flamingo and Decatur. That store has roaches running on the walls.
