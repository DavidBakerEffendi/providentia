Ordered a pizza and wings on Friday night, used the online app that said it would be delivered in 30-40 minutes. An hour and a half later I called to cancel the order when the driver knocked in the door. 

I told the manager that an hour wait over the quoted time was unacceptable and he said: "well it is Friday night"

Not my problem!  Staff up if you know it's going to be busy!  Let's see if the email for a free pizza ever shows up.
