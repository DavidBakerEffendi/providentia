I wish I could confidently support this place but the majority of the food was either dry, cold and lacked flavor.  The tables around us were left dirty, wrappers and paper napkins left on the floor.  I saw the A rated signs they received and I am perplexed at how and who they had visit this buffet.  Don't waste your money.  Run away if someone tells you to eat here.
