I haven't even been but I have a complete lack of enthusiasm to try after today's phone conversation.
Spoke with 2 people and no one could tell me about the menu when I inquired about gluten free dining. They didn't even know if the French fries were safe and "maybe" they had 1-2 items available.
I would have come in if I had a for sure answer. I don't require a wide range of items, but I don't  and want to risk it on a "maybe" and get sick because no one knows what they're talking about.
Food allergies are pretty prevalent in today's world, and it's a bit shocking that you guys aren't training staff on keeping patrons safe.
Have 1 or 2 items that are FOR SURE safe, and you'll get my business.
