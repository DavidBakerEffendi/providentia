'U MIGHT WIN SOME BUT U JUST LOST ONE" 

Lauryn Hill said it best in her song...U might win some but U just lost one is dang right.  

I used to rave about the seafood buffet at the Rio but last night's mediocre dinner and unprofessional staff proved how much the Village Seafood Buffet has FALLEN OFF.  They changed the interior design to make it look nicer but for the first time ever - NO LONG LINE!  For a Sunday night it was empty.

Even though the decor LOOKED updated  the taste of cuisine quality sank low.  The steamed crab leg was still delicious but everything else was CRAP.  Mediocre sushi, dried out rice/noodle dishes, salty salty fried food....Hometown Buffet quality food for $49 was a slap in the face.  What happened?  =(    It's sad.   Don't they know that with all the new buffets at the Wynn, Cosmo and others brand new spots they have to do MORE and be BETTER than ever?!?!  I spent $100 for 2 dinners that was horrible.

The desserts here used to be really good but it tasted different.  My favorite chocolate cup with vanilla custard and fruits was bland.  The creme brulee was grainy and mushy.  WOMP WOMP WOMP =(  FAIL.

I even had to complain to the Manager about their staff.  The girls working behind the dessert bar straight YAWNED in our faces and blatantly ignored us when we tried to get their attention.  The prime rib station guy was missing all night and kept going to the back to chat with the other workers.  The Manager didn't do anything for us (didn't expect it not surprised) but thanked me for my comments.  Note to the manager:  you should always offer a discount or rain check for another visit when you have an unhappy customer.  We're only trying to help.

*shrug*

They just lost one.
