Walked into the restaurant was greeted by the manager was told that there would be a 30 minute wait and we could visibly see there was nobody in front of us waiting the way she was talking was like she was trying to talk us out of eating here we waited for 30 minutes and then 45 minutes and finally got seated to a table ordered our drinks that took 20 minutes to get to our table and waited to order no waiter or waitress ever came manager was walking around doing nothing tried to get her attention numerous times and she would completely avoid us by this time we have been here over a hour and a half and barely have 2 drinks with no order to put in, place was not even crowded or busy. Manager had a bad attitude and finally came and said sorry I only have one waiter nothing I can do and walked away. We waited a additional 10 minutes still no body came. We couldn't believe this. This was my wife's and I first time here and now our last
We got up from the table and waited at the counter to pay for our drinks and leave 
Still nobody in sight. Manager looked at me and walked to the back. We decided we were not playing these childish games and left sorry to the owner to walk out on a cup of soda and orange juice we tried to pay for it and got completely ignore by your management. We couldn't even order food. This was absolutely the most crap service I have ever seen. What a shit show being run there avoid at all cost
Place is terrible will never return again!
