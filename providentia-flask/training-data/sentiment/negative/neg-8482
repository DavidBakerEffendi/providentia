Do not go to this pita jungle. I love pita jungle but this one does not do their food any justice. Not only is the food terrible but the service is just as bad. I ate at this pita jungle 4 times in the last couple months and each time the lettuce was old and bruised. The salads were missing at least one ingredient each time and sometimes the dressing. Finally fed up this last time I called and talked to the manager, he was about as clueless as the kitchen staff. He did not offer a new salad or any other way to fix the problems. I'm sure he was probably eager to hurry back out to smoke with the rest of the staff just outside the pick up window. Don't mind me, I love to inhale your second hand smoke as a pay 40 dollars for my overpriced wilted lettuce salad that's missing half it's ingredients.
