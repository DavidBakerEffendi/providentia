This was my second time, and both times the food came out cold and took 45 minutes. It was so hard to get our waitress' attention. We wanted drink refills, french fry refills, and even to get the check - and when we finally got her attention, she seemed so annoyed. She forgot my friend's alcoholic drink and got her sandwich wrong three times. Seriously, a bad experience.
