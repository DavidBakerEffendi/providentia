So 4 month and yet again visited not on a busy night. Greeted nicely directed to seating. Drink orders and food taken immediately,  However that's it.. they forgot drink.. something about had to do something got tied up..some reason. Food took forever and when it did arrive not even look close to the picture.. says topped with ketchup, mustard, and pickles. No sir no its not. Also says made with 100 beef, hashbrown this is true and tomatoes, onions and cheese. hmm well has browns where inside ... before yes. Over cooked and greasy.. none of the other items. Half a slice of plastic American cheese made into two triangles..beef and some tomatoes of. Top. Now when delivered I asked for ketchup and hot sauce. Was told just a moment.. again no mam.. I sat there looking good and then the server said oh yeah you asked for ketchup. Yep what should have been on the omelet already.. really very very disappointed. Wow  I miss my IHOP in Avondale they were awesome. Very disappointing
