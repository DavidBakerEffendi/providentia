Okay so this is the story of when Applebees ran away to live in the Southwest... Except they seemed to have lost something on the way down. Granted, it's a Saturday afternoon during the lunch rush but it was the little things that just made it.... Meh. 
When I walked into the restaurant I seemed to have broken the seating hostess; she just started at us until she realized she should seat us. Our waitress was nice enough when she finally showed up. We had to ask other servers for our silverware, straws, and the remaining parts of our meals. My glass was broken too... Found out the hard way. 

Food was dry and boring. Don't order the green beans, for the love of god.
