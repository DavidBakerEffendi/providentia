Just a friendly warning. They have changed hands and have new owners so you may not have the same experience as other reviewers. Big difference from before. First of all the players club shorted me on points which made me very angry , and I know I was not mistaken. The clerk even admitted that many people say the same thing. Also it is no longer 50 comps per person , it is now 75.
 So off on a bad foot I walked on because it was my father's 75th birthday.
 And down the rabbit hole we went.
Nice atmosphere, nice waiter, the word nice stops here. "Shrimp scampi" appetizer was ridiculous, three average shrimp thrown in Alfredo sauce ( On what planet is shrimp scampi cooked in Alfredo cheese sauce?!)& it was straight out of a jar no doubt. The bread escaped from the microwave onto our table to our dismay. Sea bass under-cooked, loaded with Cajun spices that were just too much and over-powering. Lobster was chewy undesirable, steak was small and again under-cooked ( ordered medium and it came mooing...) ( Surf & Turf was 60.00). The vegetables were not fresh and raw-ish and stringy with salty sauce on them.
Lobster Bisque was flour coloring salt and old lobster crumbles on top. ( shallow bowl for 10.00 too).
The carrot cake was still 1/2 frozen. ( not fresh).
So these 5 stars are from before the new owners folks. They are in need of some major tweeking now. Terrible experience, ruined my Father's special day. He went home hungry because nothing could be finished. The baked potato was good, I'll give them that much but they cheated... who can mess up "nature".....
