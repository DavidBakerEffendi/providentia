BEEEEEEEEEEP! RUDE! Take this as a warning. 

My friend wanted to grab some bubble tea before dinner, so we walked in. We weren't even a step in when this Asian greeter blocked us near the door. No "Hi, Herro or Welcome.. straight to "Sit in or take out?" 

I mumbled, "Take out please."

She swiftly took out a pad and held it close to my face, "What you want?" 

I felt like I was watching a bad chinese movie. My friend ordered. The girl didn't invite us to come in and sit during our wait. She moved past us to the counter at the very end and relayed our order to the guy behind the counter. Then, she came back with the bubble tea and thrusted it in my friend's hand, with a non-smiling "OK, BAAAAAAI."

I don't care about how good the bubble tea is. Or the fact that this place is open late. If you don't know your "Ps and Qs" you're not getting my business.
