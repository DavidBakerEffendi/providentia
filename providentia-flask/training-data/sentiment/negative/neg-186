Took 2 hours and 30 minutes to get served a three course meal.
I spent $15 on a coke & ice tea because refills are not free..... Im glad, I didn't order more drinks.
Calamari was inedible, I spit it back on my plate.
My steak was lukewarm and was old, tasted like it was warmed up in the microwave...
I ate it all because the hour wait from appetizer to main course was an hour and I was starving. 
Surprise dessert tasted like a grocery store bought piece of cake.
I headed to Jack Astors afterwards because I was left hungry and dissatisfied. 
$110 for two people...not worth it.
