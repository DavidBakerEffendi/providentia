An overall disappointing experience. Unwashed oysters full of sand and shells and horribly shucked, sat with empty drink glasses for over 30 mins, manager with a bad attitude - drinking beer with the DJ while we sat and waited for service - and poorly trained staff. The restaurant was completely empty and this should have been a warning sign of what was to come. I doubt this place will survive until Christmas. I wouldn't recommend going here at all.
