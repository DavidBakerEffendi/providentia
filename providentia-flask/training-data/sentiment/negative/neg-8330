The food is a 2.5 at best, but I am giving this a 1.0 because the customer service is horrendous. If they keep this up I give them another year before it completely fails.
I ordered the create your own baked potato, I asked for sausage on it, instead of bacon or what ever. The person at the register said she had to ask, so she turned around and asked the cook if she would do that. The cook said NO. So obviously the cashier said no I would have to order an entirely different meal to get the sausage on my baked potato. So just to see what the big deal was, I did. So I got the sausage spent the extra money and all it came with was fries.. I mean REALLY !! Now, not only am I not a happy customer, because what I asked was extremely easy to do. They turned out to be greedy.  

So in response to this and being a computer person, I am posting this to every social network. Facebook, twitter and about half of dozen others.
