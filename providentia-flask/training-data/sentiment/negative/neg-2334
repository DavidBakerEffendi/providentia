Wanted to substitute sausage for bacon in a breakfast burrito. They charged me an extra $1.00 for that. I asked her why. She said she is not allowed to substitute any ingredients - ever.

PSA for those of you who don't like their food EXACTLY the way it's printed on the menu.

I won't be back. Doesn't matter how good the food is. Restaurants with business practices that don't make sense do not earn a return visit.
