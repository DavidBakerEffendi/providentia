Made reservations way in advance for Mother's Day for indoor seating.  When I made the reservation the representative told me where we would be seated and instructed me to park in the back near there. When we arrived on time for our reservation it took them over 25 minuets to sit us at an OUTSIDE table even after verifying it twice while waiting. To add to it they sat a group ahead of us who showed up 2 hours early for their reservation because it was all they could book online. Go figure. They got sat ahead of us. Plus we had only 4 people in our party and the gratuity was already added to our bill. Great food and it ends there unfortunately.

Update: I emailed the email address given below almost immediately. It has been almost 3 full days and I haven't received a reply...
