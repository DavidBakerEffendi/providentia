One star is too generous.  Have been there 3 times.  First time was good but a weird musty smell in the place, next was poor, but the last one was the worst steak we have ever eaten.  Manager was uncaring and all he could blurt out was how their steaks were grade A top choice and aged for 21 days.   I think he told me that 3 times.  Seemed more like they were the leftovers that had been reheated a few times after other people had sent them back.  I have never complained about a meal before at a restaurant so this was a first for me.  I was embarrassed that I told anyone how good this place was, especially my parents who were visiting from Montana.  Two prime rids way over cooked and tough and 3 rib eye steaks that were like eating a piece of rubber.  We will never be returning.  I could have gotten a better steak at In & Out and they don't even serve steak....
