The food was NOT worth the ammonia you spend on it. My friends and I went here the other night and we got paneer tacos, fried rice, chili paneer, and veggie Chow mein the food took FOREVER to come out and it wasn't even busy and when it did it was nothing to brag about. The fried rice and noodles weren't that good I could get better from a take out place for WAY cheaper, the chili paneer was pretty good but there just wasn't enough for four people and same with the paneer tacos they were so good but you get 3 and they're so small!! It's honestly not worth the price you pay for the food. Might as well go to a takeout place and save your money!
