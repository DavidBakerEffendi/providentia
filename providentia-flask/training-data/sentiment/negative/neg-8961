I went to Battista's on Cinco de Mayo. It is true that the restaurant has an interesting ambiance. But for me that is where it ended. I have read reviews about the garlic bread. It was good, but just that. The free wine that everyone likes. I thought the red was terrible and the white was less than average. I didn't expect Napa, but this wine was not good. I had Veal Parmasaen and it was over cooked and over sauced. The sauce bothered me the entire evening, way too much paste. It was awful and for the price I was just bewildered how this establishment is still around. My wife couldn't finish her food (Seafood Pasta) and my friend made negative comments about his dish. Service was good.  I'm sure this place has it's loyal customers and maybe it used to be a good place, but I'll never eat here again.
