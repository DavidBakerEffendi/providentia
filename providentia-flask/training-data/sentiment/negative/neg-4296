This is by far the worst establishment I have ever ordered from, I am outraged of the services and the food from this place, the deliver guy was outright rude and demanding, he demanded for a larger tip, he wanted $20 instead of $10. 
Let alone the rude delivery driver, the food was wrong, they put several toppings that I did not want on my pizza and also they forgot napkins and forks and they even forgot to bring out Mac & Cheese balls.
I also called to advise them and they told me they don't care and they will not fix the order nor will they refunded my money, I will never in my life go to this place again and I hope anyone else who wants to eat here does not 
They are very unprofessional and rude and they call you names when they are being proved wrong. 

I have contacted the BBB and grub hub and several other food services and they will do their own investigation. 

Your pizza place is a terrible establishment. 
Your employees are so rude and demanding.
