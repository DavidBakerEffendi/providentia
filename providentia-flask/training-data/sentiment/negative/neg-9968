Please avoid this place at all costs, it is cheap for a reason, the food is bland and very greasy like if they fry the food in warm oil. All plates come with rice and an egg roll, the fried rice is just disgusting tasted like dirty water. Orange chicken in sauce that is not sweet at all, I don't understand how the place has been open for so long.
