This review is based on take out...

Since it was NYE we decided to treat the family to extra yummy salad, pizza and wings.  Being from NY it's definitely the closest to "home" that we found so far.
The antipasto salad was "skimpy" in the toppings department, the boneless wings were soggy and the pizza was just okay. One of the pizzas had huge dough bubbles on one side, therefore lacking cheese and toppings.  Probably something beyond your control but definitely not the pizza quality we've become accustomed to at NYPD.

Again it was NYE, and you were really busy...but nonetheless our meal left us underwhelmed. Your prices are definitely higher then other local options but typically the experience is well worth the higher price tag.
