Horrible location! After my experience today I will never go here again and I suggest you don't either. I arrived at 12:06 and ordered a turkey,bacon, avocado salad with no tomatoes Took 25 min to get my order. I drove to work to go eat and open the salad and the only thing on it are turkey and onion. It was missing everything else. I call to complain they say they will fix it and to come back. (This sounded good so far minus me having to leave work again and postponing lunch 2 hours) I arrive back and they said they will fix it right away and give me my money back. That's when I wait again...and continue to wait. There are 4 people in the restaurant why it took more then 5 min to remake a salad I have no idea. 15 minutes later I was still waiting. I had an appointment at 2 so I just ask for the manager so I can get my money back. He asked what I wanted and I said I wanted my money back and I did want my salad but I have to go and this wait has been ridiculous. That's when the cook looked over at me and said, "If you want your salad so back why don't you F***ing come back here and make it yourself". I was shocked that a place of business is run like this. You have loser my business and my friends and family for good!
