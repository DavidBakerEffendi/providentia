My one and only time coming here. Workers got orders wrong, they work hard but just not smart (efficient). Customers are way sketch, the drive thru is a joke, you get better service inside. And the ppl hanging out in the parking lot makes you scared getting out of the car. So I understand why ppl go to drive thru here but it's just not worth the long wait.
