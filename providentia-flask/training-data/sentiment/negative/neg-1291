I went to Denny's because I just wanted a decent meal without much fuss. i need higher standards. 

I got to Denny's a little after 7am this morning - there were some people there, but not many. I was greeted. Well, if you consider a guy yelling from the back "WAIT THERE" a greeting, I was greeted. 

I ordered a vegetable omelet which included chopped squash, mushrooms, spinach and swiss cheese. The vegetables were great - fresh, cooked enough - pleasing. The swiss cheese um you know how overly processed food, especially cheese, when it cools it does so into a rather disgusting blob and it wasn't that good to begin with. Yeah, it was swiss-cheese-like... sorta.

I got two pieces of whole wheat toast - 25% of my toast was burnt to a crisp. Who WANTS burnt toast? I thought about sending it back, but didn't really need a full two pieces of toast. Still, the bread is so expensive you have to serve it after you burn it?  The strawberry jam meh, at best. 

The service was excellent, I must say. I paid some $10+, no beverage, but including tip and tax. Yeah, not planning on going back to Denny's - I could have made the same meal at home for about $1.50 and not burned the toast. 

Oh, and the guy who yelled "WAIT THERE"? Maybe he had just eaten breakfast and he thought I might run back to my car. I should have.
