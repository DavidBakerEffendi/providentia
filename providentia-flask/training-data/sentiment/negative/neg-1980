Just had such a bad experience after ordering online.  

I ordered a gluten free pizza & added truffle oil for $2.00 additional.  The guy handed me the pizza, failed to tell me it didn't have truffle oil on it and I asked and he said no.  The cashier tried to give me cash and I said no I want it refunded on the card.

Then they didn't even apologize.  The manager went to argue with me and tell me I have to understand that they opened in May and are still working out the kinks.  Sir it's November.  You've been open for half a year.

He then hits a few buttons on his screen and says "looks like I learned something new today" after telling me there's no way to process a refund in the system, he processed a refund.  

He went on to crumble up the paper and didn't apologize or show any genuine interest or sincerity.

I work in hospitality and food and beverage.  If you just opened a month ago this may cut it, not after a half of a year.  

I won't be back and wouldn't recommend anyone to go here.  Pay a few extra dollars and dine at Grimaldi's.
