Had the breakfast at the Trump Hotel, for $50 we had a croissant egg sandwich and 3 walnut pancakes!! 

The pancakes were horrible, cold, dry, and the walnuts were whole, the time was not taken to cut them into smaller pieces!!  The egg sandwich had 2 whole pieces of sausage, not pattys, 2 sausage rolls and they were not cooked properly.

What an absolute waste of money!  Go to the Grand Luxe breakfast buffet at the Venetian...fantastic!
