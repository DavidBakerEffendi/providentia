Disappointed. 

First time when I went there, the line was too long so I left. A year went by, I had another chance to try the place. 

After waited in such a long line and paid that much money. I was very disappointed. The food was so so, nothing stood out. The services were average but below par if you considered it's in a hotel. 

You will have a lot better buffet in Paris, trust me.
