We decided to order from Avanti last Friday night. We placed our order for a meatball sandwich, a BBQ sandwich and garlic bread. It took well over an hour to arrive when the restaurant is only a mile away. More importantly, the food was disgusting. Both sandwiches came on untoasted soggy buns. The contents of those sandwiches tasted like they came to us straight from the freezer to the microwave. The meatball sub is only disgusting frozen meatball and sauce. Where's the cheese?? Not on this sandwich! The BBQ sub was sickeningly sweet. It was barely edible at all. 

tl;dr Avid this place at all cost.
