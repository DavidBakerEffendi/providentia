I ordered this pizza online through Eat24. We ordered a pizza and a 2 liter soda. I was a little confused why the cost of sauce was not in with the initial cost of pizza, but okay, paid $2 for sauce (just make the pizza cost $15, come on guys). So the order was placed at 6:50 to be delivered by 8:05. By 8:20 the pizza was not here so I called and they said "Oh yeah it's out for delivery." Cool, I can deal with that. 15 minutes later they call me and tell me that our order was caught in a "shift change" and was never made. They offered a discount (initially 50%, then $3, and then an email that said $2.09) and a free dessert. After the delivery guy got lost we got the pizza in about 25 minutes. So it arrived looking very undercooked and soggy. They could have kept it in the oven for like 5 more minutes and it would be good. I had a slice and fed my son some and then my husband went for his slice and found a hair embedded in it. Obviously we were both disgusted. My husband was already super fed up and gave them a call and they refused to refund it. They offered a free pizza but neither of us wanted soggy hair pizza. Luckily Eat24 has good customer service because now we can order a good pizza some where else!

The 2 liter was good though.
