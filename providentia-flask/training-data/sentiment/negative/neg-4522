Terrible service!!! I placed my order (cashier asked me twice what I wanted) then waited 30 mins because she forgot to place the order!! I also got a miso soup with my meal which they poured too early so it was cold by the time I got my actual dish. Once I was finally able to eat my food I was hugely disappointed. The miso soup was too salty and the bacon kimchi stir fry had a weird smell to it. Don't go there. Save your money.
