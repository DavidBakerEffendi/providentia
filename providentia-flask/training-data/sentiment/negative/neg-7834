We decided to try out this thai place due to high rating. The food tastes decent, except for the soup was too sour. They put too much MSG in their food. My body usually does not react easily to MSG. However, after finishing my dinner there, I started feeling dizzy, and remained that state for the whole night. The amount of MSG they put into the soup and curry must be insane. Will never come back.
