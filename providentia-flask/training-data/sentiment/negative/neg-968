YUCK. And I mean that will all gusto behind the word. I absolutely did not like this place. It's very rare that I dislike a place this much. I usually can find something redeeming (like Los Olivos does have some pretty damn good salsa), but I could not see myself going here ever, ever again... unless my family dragged me here. They, of course, loved this place. 

YUM. That's what my family said. I asked them what I should say in my review. My dad loved Los Olivos and said he'd rate 'em 4.5 stars. He only deducted the 1/2 star because they took our chips away before we were finished with them. I guess it was a bartering system: your entrees for our chips. 

Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing. After all, I didn't want to drown in grease, so I picked the shrimp entree that came with rice. I picked at the soggy rice. I nibbled on the burnt garlic toast. And the shrimp? Well, let's just say I wasn't expecting to have to work for my food. I had to peel the shell off myself. "How do I do that?" I asked horrified. Still a shrimp novice, I had no clue. "You grab their little legs and pull." I nearly had to excuse myself to go throw up.
