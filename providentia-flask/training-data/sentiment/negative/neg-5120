I can't speak about the food because frankly after knowing what happens at night I wouldn't want to eat here. If you want to practice your UFC fighting skills come here where you'll meet up with Strongsville's "finest" W 6th rejects. This is not a relaxing come grab a drink kind of bar. Bring your own pen because apparently bartenders just give your receipt with no pen.
