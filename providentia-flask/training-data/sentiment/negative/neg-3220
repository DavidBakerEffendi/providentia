So I went here to pick up to go and I ordered miso soup,chicken teriyaki bowl and a seaweed salad. Food is overpriced. There's no description for their menu and nothing special with the place. I wasn't going to have a problem until this guy who is getting my food ready literally used his bare hands to pick up the seaweed salad to transfer it to my to go container. IT WAS DISGUSTING! He even did it in front of me. After that he started touching everything even the trash can! The only good thing is that the other guy cooking my chicken teriyaki is wearing plastic gloves. I'm not coming back here.
