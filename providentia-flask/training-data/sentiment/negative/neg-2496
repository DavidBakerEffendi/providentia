i made the mistake of ordering takeout from here. this place is incredibly overhyped by people who obviously have no idea of what flavor is. I got the duck bowl and the duck was dry and a leather boot and drowned in soy sauce. my friend got the tofu appetizer and the tofu tasted like it got forgotten in the freezer. I got the Shizu ramen and it was truly appalling and I didn't even finish it the broth tasted like it came from a maruchan pack. this food was not worth the 45$
