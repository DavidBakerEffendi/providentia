This chain claims a reputation for being "freaky fast"--and the good locations are, with teams in some locations that can have your sandwich ready by the time you pay. This one is not one of those.  This location is Super Slow, and poorly staffed and not that crowded when I got here. And the kitchen staff was rude ... one girl went and turned up the music for no reason. Then went even louder--we couldn't hear the orders called out once they were finally ready. I asked them to turn it down, but was told by another rude staff member, "it is supposed to be loud."  Not a place to come with friends unless you have lots of time and no desire to pass that time by talking
