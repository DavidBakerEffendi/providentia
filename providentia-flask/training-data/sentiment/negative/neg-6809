I have been to this location numerous of times. I prefer Crocker Park location over this one but because we were in the neighborhood we decided to go to lunch here. We were seated very quickly but it's took the waitress 20 minutes to even approach our table. So we decided to go to Granite city instead. Granite city was so delicious.
