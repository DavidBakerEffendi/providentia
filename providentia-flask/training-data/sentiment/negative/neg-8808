I eat here a lot I live right down the street and I love their fries. I got in drive thru at 3:09 2 people in front of me, 2 behind. I ordered 2 meals and they asked me to park and wait because it will take awhile to make my food, which is perfectly fine. 27 mins later he brings out my food. The fries were old over cooked and cold, I ordered a large fry and it was less than half full. My small fry was full but also old & over cooked and cold. Both burgers were also wrong. I'm not sure what is going on there but I'm not going back at night 

The owner was wearing an $80 affliction shirt why can't he spend that money to replace the parking lot.
