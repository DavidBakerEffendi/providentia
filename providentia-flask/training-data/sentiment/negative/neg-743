WORST service ever!! Attempted to eat here with 3 friends, just now,  but we were never seated. The waitress walked past us 3 times and said excuse me to move past us, but never once actually acknowledged us. We felt like we weren't welcome. After waiting 10 min, we finally left. The waitress was at the register , not assisting anyone, when I said  "Guess we will leave!" She had the nerve to say "Bye, thank you!" 

What makes it even worse is that they weren't even busy!! There were 4 tables max! 

I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!!!! Terrible customer service!!!
