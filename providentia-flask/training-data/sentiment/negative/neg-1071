I brought my drink stamp card in that says "collect 10 drinks and get a free boba milk tea", ok, I'm not a big fan of boba milk tea so I ask if I can just deduct the price of the milk tea off the bill, the owner said no, then I ask if I can just have regular Jasmine tea instead and the owner says I can't, seriously? I look at their price chart and the price for boba milk tea and jasmine tea are exactly the same, All the other boba place such as No. 1 Boba will even just let you take off the price off your free drink, that's it for me, I won't ever come back for such horrible customer service, and will tell my friend all about it.
