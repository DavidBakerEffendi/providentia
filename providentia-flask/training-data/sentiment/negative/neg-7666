Terrible, cheap feeling, disgusting food for $30/person, dirty, bugs, rubbery seafood, fake mashed potatoes, at least prime rib gave it a one star! Wasted so much food since much of it wasn't editable. Couldn't get an iced tea refill to save your life. Don't waste ur time. I've been to cheep buffets in Vegas that were 300% better!!
