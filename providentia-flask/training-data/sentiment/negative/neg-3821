I was so excited to come here, and my experience today left a lot to be desired.  The service was awful.  It took me nearly 30 mins to get a water.  My husband even left his seat to remind them, and still had to remind them again 10 mins later.  The room we were in had only 1 other table of 4 occupied.  The food (which was the reason we came) was completely lacking flavor.  The chicken for my chicken and waffles looked exactly the same as my son's overcooked, rock hard chicken strip.  So $60 later, I would have been happier at Ihop.
