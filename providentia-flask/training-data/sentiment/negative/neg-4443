I've been meaning to go to Chito's for awhile after hearing about it a few years ago I finally went. It's shawarma on pizza - what could go wrong? Unfortunately, it was a HUGE disappointment - the garlic sauce was neither garlicky or saucy, it was super salty, and the hot sauce was nothing special. The chicken shawarma itself was dry and chopped up to minced proportions. Overall, I'm in shock that they could mess up shawarma!

Pros:
- Cheap - $2.50 for shawarma pizza slice

Cons:
- The garlic sauce was too salty and didn't taste like garlic
- The chicken shawarma was dry and chopped up weird

Note: One of my friends said it was amazing, and a second friend's second slice looked a little better. Maybe it's hit or miss, but I wouldn't give it a second chance even if it only cost me $2.50.
