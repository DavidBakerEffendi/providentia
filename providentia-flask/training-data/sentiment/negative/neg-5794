We, unfortunately, had a negative experience at Everly when we came for brunch this Saturday.  I should start by saying that the service was excellent and the space is very nice. Our waitress, the hostess and the general manager were all great.

The problem is that both my wife and I both became very sick after eating at Everly. About an hour after eating my wife started vomiting and I also became sick to my stomach as well. Everly was the only thing we had eaten at the the time. We suspect it may have been the smoked salmon and avocado benedict (the salmon tasted a bit off) or the whitefish tuna toast.    We're still very sick at 8pm at night. We hope they get this problem sorted out before it affects other customers.
