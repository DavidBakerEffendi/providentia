Went based on reviews. It does look divey on the outside but sometimes the best restaurants do. Walked in and wasnt greeted, shuffled around the dining room for awhile looking for a booth to sit in not covered in crumbs. A lady working in the dining room called for a waitress to come out to me. She brought chips and salsa and was nice enough. I asked for a water which came out shortly. I ordered a beer and said I needed another minute with the menu. I guess there was my mistake. At least 10 minutes later my beer and server had never materialized again.  There were only 2 other people in the restaurant. I left a dollar for the chips and salsa i ate while waiting for my waitress to return and walked out. I passed a couple employees behind the counter talking happily. Shame, the cordon bleu shrimp and smoked marlin quesadillas sounded really damn good.
