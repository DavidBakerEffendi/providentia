Rude service at the bar when I had breakfast there by myself this morning. It's odd because the servers were nice to everyone seated next to me at the bar. But when the bill came they practically threw the bill at me. I won't be returning. It's a disappointment since the service has been so lovely at all the other Wynn hotels. 

I wasn't offered any coffee refills, water, condiments for my dish, all of which were offered to folks next to me. The eggs in my LEO salmon egg bagel dish were completely unseasoned and lacking in flavor.
