Really disappointing food. The service was slow but polite. 

It seemed very inefficient to have four different servers attending to the same small area - but even worse was that only the one assigned to us would actually acknowledge us, so we ended up waiting for every little thing. 

For the food, my companion had chicken parm, which was ok but not flavorful at all. It didn't even come with pasta. I had a Greek salad that was barely edible - overcooked, dry chicken, wilting lettuce, and huge chunks of unripe tomato and cucumber and onion. All the veggies were in enormous pieces that had to be cut several times to fit inside a mouth. The 'Italian' dressing was just a plastic cup of oil with some giardiniera in it. 

We only drank water, but the meal still cost $35. Ridiculous for a basic chicken dish and an old salad. Will not go back.
