Rude & Arrogant people! Its our first time going there! Lost our reservation for valentines after i msde it a month ago! husband was overseas and was going to surprise him.. They completely ruined it and made no effort to correct it. Then owner got on phone and was very rude and arrogant when I was complaining and proceeded to tell me how good they're apparently doing! In this economy Mr. Owner it's a blessing, I'm sure with this kind of attitude you'll just fine without us and many other people..  I'll be sure to spread the word about your establishment Thanks for ruining our special day.
