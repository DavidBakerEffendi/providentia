I used to go here often when I went to MCC.  I admit that the food was pretty good, but the owner ruined the entire experience for me.  At the time, I was learning Japanese and wanted to try it out in an actual setting.  He yelled at me the first time I tried and told me to speak English.

Another instance, and the real reason I don't go back there, is when a friend of mine went to eat there.  After he finished, he said "Gochisousamadeshita" (a polite saying thanking the preparer of the food for the meal) and the owner muttered under his breath "Henna Gaijin" (strange foreigner).

I can understand not having the patience to speak Japanese with me, but really.....insulting someone who just thanked you for the food?  That's enough for me to never return.
