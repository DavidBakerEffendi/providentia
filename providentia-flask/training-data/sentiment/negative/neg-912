You know it is bad when you wish you spent your 8 bucks on Fast Food instead.  This place is a dump.  What can I say about the food.   It was just bad bad and more bad.  Nothing but the salad tasted good.   Everything tasted old and stale.  Man you know it is bad when you were happy to get a left over donut from the breakfast buffet.. hahahahaha...  Yeah it was that bad.  Chicken dry, Chinese food taste like crap.  I could go on and on...    

I will close it out with this.   I might think twice about going here if it was FREE..  Not joking.
