So, it breaks my heart to break-up with East Side pizza but the time has come. After 8 years and 3 owners since the good old days of Gerry and Peg owning the joint the time has come.
The pizza is no longer NY style and none of the employees are left. Even after 3 owners they stayed true to the product and service but now it's an end of an era.

The pizza crust is non existent. No flavor, no give and the sauce makes the pizza taste and feel like it's been sitting out a buffet untouched for hours.

I called to ask for the new owner and was told he was in a meeting. At 6:45 pm on a Tuesday. Got a lady on the phone by the name of Robin on the phone who said she was the owners 2nd in command. I explained how  disappointed we were in our order and she told me they were new and hadn't finalized their new recipe yet for the pizza. After nearly 6 weeks. But the thing is, this pizza wasn't off or just not so good, it's awful. And, even so they were charging the same premium price for a custom NY pizza.  Ugh! She just didn't get it. She Asked me what was wrong with the pizza and what they could do to make it better. I tried to explain the pizza was not the same but she just kept trying to convince me to give them another chance and tell her what they could do better. I appreciate the offer to help them but, Honey, if I knew how to make a good NY pizza in Vegas I would east side pizza and bring it back to life. I thanked her for her time and wished them well.

Next time we want NY pizza, we won't be going to East Side. Farewell, East Side.
