Good food if u like it! If u r new and don't the service on behalf of the management is HORRIBLE!!! Pete the manager not only compared our experience to others on the sales item, but wouldn't be courteous enough to remove the item. I have NEVER heard of the customer when dining having this matter. 
I enjoy the food but because of treatment will NEVER eat here again!
