I was SO excited to check out Hot Head Burritos. I noticed the sign the last time I went on a Target run and just had to bookmark this place for later. Can I start off this review by saying that I love Mexican food. I also love burritos. Not to mention, I am a huge fan of Chipotle (or at least I was, I'll admit I haven't been since its been in the news). So, it makes me sad that I left Hot Heads completely disappointed. 

During my visit to Hot Head there were only two other groups there. I walked to the front, looked at the menu and realized that this place was similar to Chipotle-- sweet! I was pretty excited to get my bowl on! As I stand there ready to order, I realize that there is no one there to help me! I hear some talking in the kitchen. This tall guy looks over and sees me, and then looks away. Um, okay. So, I stand there patiently. Finally after like 10 minutes, a girl comes from the other way and tells me that she will be right back. At this point, my friend wanted to leave. I would have just agreed but I had hope this place would be amazeballs. She finally comes back and takes our order. Just like Chipotle, I go down the counter and I pick all the things I want on my bowl. She gave me decent sized portions, but that may just be the guilt because she knew that I waited for so long. 


The moment of truth: the food kind of sucked. Okay, it sucked a lot. Between the bowl, the burrito and the nachos that we ordered-- none of it was REALLY good. Nothing special. Which makes it even worst was that this was my cheat meal for the week. Maybe that just added fuel to the fire of disappointment. Even though their little flame logo and their decor is pretty darn cute, I will not be going back to Hot Head any time soon.
