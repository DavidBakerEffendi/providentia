For the price that we pay i would expect them to serve food which is worth every penny , Lobster tail is something that we digg for and was a dissappointment. I tasted a werid taste which i informed the waitress, she smelled it and confirmed they smell funny and would let the chef know. 5 minutes later the chef came up and expalained it to us that 1 in 100 loster tail is bad and probably i got that one which was bad and he apologized and offered me a drink, which i politly declined because i was not looking for anything free. Just wanted him to know that there was something wrong. Changed my plate and got another serving of lobster tail and again got a bad one this time, Manager came around and gave me BS that they are not bad just that they smell that way i was so pissed that i know the difference between the way they smell and taste and then while explaining me he mentioned that they have been using cheaper lobster tail instead of canadian because they cost went up on them, my question was IF YOU ARE NOT SERVING THE BEST WHY ARE YOU STILL CHARGING THE SAME PRICE , the worst thing was the waitress disussing there hours so loud that i was able to hear how unhappy they were serving us or other because after working for so long with the hotel they were switched to on call and given less hours . It just shows poor service and poor quality of food and we consumer's still fall for the crapy over priced food ,Not going back again ever
