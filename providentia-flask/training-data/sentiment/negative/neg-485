Well, this delivery option has gone way downhill. I've ordered from them twice in the last month and have been very dissatisfied. The first time, the order was missing some things. Also, the Szechuan tofu I ordered was really bad. It was really just tofu swimming in a watery chili juice with a few tiny pieces of chicken in it. Wow, nope. I called and complained about this and the missing eggrolls and was promised free apps next time. I ordered last night and got the Hunan scallops. For 9 bucks, we had hoped for more than 5 thinly-sliced scallops. It was almost all broccoli and green peppers. BU HAO CHI. Also, there is a coupon for free crab Rangoon if you order over a certain amount. I asked to use that coupon, and they sent me TWO orders of crab Rangoon. So, instead of saving me money and comping the one order, they just charge me for the first order and throw in another. This seems shady. I made it very clear I only wanted one order of them. This has happened more than once.

Lastly, I ordered some sushi, which is usually passably good. This time, an entire roll (the Christmas roll) was fishy-tasting and inedible. In the past, if you ordered a roll spicy, they'd add some spicy mayo to the roll. Now, I have both recent times gotten a roll slathered with Sriracha. That sucks.

Sure, we got some free eggrolls. This did not nearly make up for the lousy sushi and scallop miserliness.

It seems like Oriental Wok is cutting some corners, and it shows. I won't be ordering delivery from them until they can remedy the declining quality of their food.
