Not sure if we came at a bad time and ordered the wrong foods or what but this place did not live up to the hype. Hubby had the black bean burger with potato wedges, I got the wood fired chicken with mashed potatoes and tomatoes, everything on his plate and my plate tasted extremely acidic with very little flavor differentiation. I couldn't get a bite of anything to cool my stinging mouth. I would've asked for ranch dressing or some type of equivalent to cool the black bean burger if the server had ever checked back on us but she didn't. She also didn't say a word when she threw our check down on the table before we were done eating.

UPDATE: I emailed as requested below in the response from Pita Jungle and was never responded to.
