I don't understand all the hype about the Village Seafood Buffet.  Came here with my boyfriend the Tuesday after Memorial Day and we both thought it sucked.  I don't think there was a single thing that I liked at the buffet and I LOVE seafood...

The crab was not fresh at all (no crab taste and the meat was a little off-colored).  There weren't any lobsters.  Their clam chowder had way too much cream and not enough clams.  The gumbo was the worse sh*t I've ever tasted.  And don't even get me started on the raw bar.  That crap was just disgusting.  The oysters were covered in ice and super dry/old.  I didn't even dare try them because I was convinced I'd get food poisoning from them.

Their dessert selection was just as disappointing.  I was excited that they had a gelateria but their gelato was some of the worst I've tasted.  Sampled some other desserts as well but nothing was good.

I suggest you just skip this buffet and go to Bellagio or Wynn instead.  This place is so not worth the $40/person it charges.  Uber disappointment =(
