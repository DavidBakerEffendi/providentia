I'm still so confused about this place. Two of us walked in there at 8:50 pm on a Saturday (we were dressed really nicely- not that it should matter or whatever). About 25-30% of the tables were empty. One man (a manager I believe) told us he would be right with us, so we waited about 5 min. Then a waitress came up to us and said "I'm sorry, I don't think we can seat you, we are really busy." It was so bizarre- there were so many tables open and the kitchen didn't close for over another hour. We went an ate elsewhere, but it was really weird and kind of offensive just being denied like that.
