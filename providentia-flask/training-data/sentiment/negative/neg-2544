Disgusting! Felt like I was on Fear Factor, except I paid to eat there.  Everything was funky.....taste, smell, texture. Wished I read Yelp before ordering.  Even the white rice was really odd.  Can't put my finger on it, but it was like extra dense and just strange.  Have never had a Chinese place mess up white rice.  Shrimp toast was oddly large, burnt, smelly and can't imagine what decade the shrimp was from.  Teriyaki sticks could have been squirrel.  So gross, threw out most of it. Oh, and it took an hour and a half. Would not eat here for free! At least I did not get maggots like a previous poster.... I think?? God help me tomorrow.
