Horrible quality!! Have been eating here with our parents and family for years. Service & food pretty good, no complaints. The last three visits have been dissapointing. Had lunch last week with siblings. The hamburger was undercooked so they brought the same burger back microwaved! Lettuce and tomatoes soggggggyyy! Horrible! Manager was annoyed at our complaint. The fries aren't cooked correctly with lots of grease, not crisp at all. Majority of other completed parties left their fries on their plates without eating them. Doesn't the cook understand that when plates are coming back with certain foods untouched somethings wrong? Bring in better quality cooks and better French fries!
