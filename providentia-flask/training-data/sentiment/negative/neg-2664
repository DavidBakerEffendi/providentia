Unfortunately it has come to this. I love filibertos but they have broken my heart at this location. I came here every few days for almost two years. My friends and i used to spend over a 100 dollars a week here at one point and I cant let it be stuffed under the rug anymore.
This location has become one of the worst locations when it comes to customer service and food quality. First off, at my defense I am a foodie. Portions are my thing and filibertos fulfilled that thing until now. Burritos became smaller with content wrapped in excess tortilla, chips and salsa i ordered were stale and the salsa was watery. Potatoes in my AZ burrito were uncooked, almost as if raw. As a regular who sees the same cook and cashier every night for 3+ years I still have not been treated with appropiate customer service or greeted as a returning customer even when I come back twice in one day. Bottom line, Since it has opened it has digressed. Completely disappointed when I absolutely love this place.
