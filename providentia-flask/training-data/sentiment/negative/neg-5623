Avoid this place unless you enjoy being overcharged for mediocre, inconsistent food. Steak was fair (mine was fine, hers was tough and overdone), but the shrimp were badly overcooked and rubbery with a slop of mayonnaise-heavy filling and the careless addition of bacon. It was like they just threw some bacon on there because hey, everybody loves bacon. Yeah, not that much. The dessert was terrible. (Really -- you can mess up dessert.) The red velvet cake was...not much like cake at all. It was a sticky, oversweet (and oversized) brick that I could barely cut with a fork. That's not an exaggeration, we literally struggled to cut through the cake (it was served as a doubled portion for two). Sides were very good, but not near enough to compensate for the other shortfalls, especially at the prices they charge. Service was fine (good waiter) but the maitre d' practically walked away before we could return his greeting. You'll do a lot better elsewhere. I could tell you where, but Yelp CENSORED my recommendation. Look in Middleton.
