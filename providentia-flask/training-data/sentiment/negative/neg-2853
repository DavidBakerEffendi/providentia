Thumbs down.  Was very excited because I had hoped it would be like Lyfe Kitchen, healthy, original, vegan.  When we went to order, they assumed we had been there before and didn't explain the ordering concept.  Then they biffed our order and forgot our sweet potato fries, even when we asked for them again.  Never got them.  Then they charged us for the larger bowl when we ordered the smaller one.  They said the tofu couldn't count as one of the smaller sides, which means we got one side too few.  Very confusing for an empty restaurant where they had all the time in the world to explain things to us.  We doubt we'll try it again.
