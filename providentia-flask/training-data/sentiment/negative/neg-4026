The food tasted bad. The prime rib and ribs tasted awful and the pho was even worse. The service was not good. I had to ask the waiter to clear my table two times and he did not look happy. He should be asking me if he can clean my table instead of me having to flag him down. I expected better food and service for the price that I paid. I would not recommend this place.
