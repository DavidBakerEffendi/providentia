a very disappointing experience. I had a squash burrito that was soaked dripping in oil. I don't think there was anything else other than the fat tortilla. my friend had a salad that was mediocre at best. all the former ambiance of the last two establishments is now gone. if you're going to do vegetarian, you might want to take a look at your competition down the street, Greens. they pack it in.
