TERRIBLE service!! We live an hour & a half from Cleveland & came to the city for some good drinks & food & were very disappointed in the service. Our bartender neglected us, one of my friends waited 20 minutes for a drink! Mind you, it was extremely slow. We asked for waters & our bartender completely ignored our request & just walked into the kitchen & didn't come back out for a good 10 minutes. He yelled "last call!" & we asked for 2 more drinks & he said "no" & that we could only order shots for last call. This was a Friday night as well. We also wanted to put in just 1 more taco order 10 minutes prior to closing & they said no to that as well! The worst service I've ever received, I'm a server as well, I'm not nitpicking. It's a shame, the food was great but they lost 4 good customers & gained terrible reviews for future customers coming to Cleveland for some good Mexican food.
