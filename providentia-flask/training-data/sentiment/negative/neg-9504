My cousin and I went maybe a month back. 

Man I feel like I had my first sushi experience all over again. My first experience I got some foul smelling fish and food poisoning. I swore to never eat sushi again but I've had many in between a that wowed me.


The price is cheap. The place was pretty much empty but the sushi was old and had no variety. I was hoping it would ramp up because we came just before lunch. But the place stayed dead and no new food came out. We reluctantly tried many dishes but still  we were left with the same feelings I got when mom made me eat Brussel sprouts.(no offense to anyone who likes them)

So yeah my friends- conveyer belt sushi is not in.
