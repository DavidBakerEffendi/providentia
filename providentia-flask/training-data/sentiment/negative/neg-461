Terrible terrible terrible. I went to this particular store today. I noticed they were out of many of bagel types and had at least six people working up front. Unfortunately they were very slow in getting out orders. I ordered two breakfast sandwiches and waited almost 20 minutes. The majority of the customers in the establishment were also waiting for their orders and equally frustrated. After waiting for 10 minutes, one of the employees said they were out of the specific bagel (for the sandwich) and to pick another type.  Even after that, I had to wait an additional 9 minutes.
