How is this place 4 rated stars overall?! I came here expecting above average pho but I walked out disappointed. Immediately when I walked in, I noticed there was all caucasians...so i was thinking to myself what should I expect. I ordered the rare beef pho, they only had one size and the price was $9.75...i mean talk about overpriced?! It was even more dissatisfying when the bowl came out. All you could see was layers of oil. The broth was so cloudy, you couldn't even see the meat or noodles under it. Then I started eating it, broth had little to no flavour and they literally dumped the beef in a big chunk making it hard to separate. Just horribly disappointed. This place doesn't even deserve a two star because it was literally a hole in the wall, it was so pretty dirty inside. Definitely not going back.
