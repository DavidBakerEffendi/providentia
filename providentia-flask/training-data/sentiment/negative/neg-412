We waited for 45+ minutes and never received our food. Everyone else in there was in the same boat. They kept filling to go orders instead of people who were dining in. We asked for a refund and DIDNT EVEN GET AN APOLOGY. We will NOT be returning to this place and plan on spreading the word to whoever we can.
