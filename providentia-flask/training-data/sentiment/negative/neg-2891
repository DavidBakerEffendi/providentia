Food is general McDonald's food which is pretty tasty so no complaints there.  The only issue I have with this McDonald's is several times we have gone there and they have messed up my wife's order.  She always gets a double quarter pounder meal but 3 times now they have left a patty off her sandwich and at least once they have left a whole sandwich out of our bag.  So if you go there make sure to double check that you got your whole order.
