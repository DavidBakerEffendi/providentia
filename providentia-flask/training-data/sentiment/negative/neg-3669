First of the line to get in the buffet was super long on a Wednesday night . We waited a nearly an hour and a half . Then when we get to the register , the cashier was so cold.  Like she didn't smile or anything.  It was 6 of us going out for a birthday dinner.  So we get to a table and we start getting our food. The food selection was mediocre because there was not that much variety or quality food.  The bar drinks were delicious.  We had strawberry margaritas the were good , are they worth the price , yes and no.  Yes because they are very tasty . And no because it was very small.  The desserts very limited variety . For the price of the buffet  I really expected food that was going to wow me . But it didn't.  The service by our server was awesome I think out of all of the people we encountered she was the best one of all.
