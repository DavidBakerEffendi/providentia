We have been wanting to try this place for quite a while.   We finally got the chance tonight. It was a rather unfortunate experience.  Our pizza was burnt and thus overly crispy.  My fiancé got take out then picked me up from work.  By the time we got home,  the pizza was no longer edible as it was way too crispy and salty. It was also so greasy that it stained the car seat.  I wonder if the person who pulled it out of the oven didn't notice the obviously blackened bacon.   I'm shocked that they didn't offer him a discount, a redo or even a free pizza.   He didn't know that it was burnt until we got home and we are too far away to go back. There was also an unusual afttertaste that I can't quite place. A very disappointing experience. My fiancé, one of the long lost Ninja Turtle brothers will still give them another try though.
