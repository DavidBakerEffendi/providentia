Ok I know it's in an airport. But this was by far the most flavor less, bland Asian food I've ever had! Bland and Asian rarely go together.  But this food had NONE. Let me be specific. I ordered the Beef bowl. They claim it was marinated. But in what? Must have been water. While I don't claim to be a salt a holic, this food was devoid of any salt whatsoever. Even adding salty soy sauce didn't help much.

So IF you must eat at the Charlotte airport, just go next door to the Carolina BBQ place which is FAR better! Or really any other place other than Blando Grill.
