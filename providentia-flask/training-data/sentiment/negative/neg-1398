The tacos were mediocre, street corn wasn't great, and they screwed up our order, although they were nice about fixing it. My biggest problem here is with an extremely rude, unprofessional staff member. I went in to this restaurant with my boyfriend, and a woman who had just finished her shift sat down next to him and proceeded to blatantly hit on him as if I wasn't even there, although it was very clear that we were there together. It made it very difficult to enjoy my date with my boyfriend when there was a staff member who continued to rudely interject herself into our conversation and flirt with him. As we were leaving I told her that I didn't appreciate her hitting on my boyfriend the entire time and she insulted me. I am appalled that a staff member thinks it's ok to hit on customers who are out on a date and then insults them afterwards... I will not be returning anytime soon.
