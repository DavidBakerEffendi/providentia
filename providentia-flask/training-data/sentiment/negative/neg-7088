Unbelievably horrible service!! The food was good, the drinks were yummy but our wait person (Susan) ignored us most of the night, even turned and walked away when we called her for some service. There were six of us and it took forever to get our drinks! It took forever to get our order placed, there wasn't any salt or pepper on the table and we kept having to ask repeatedly for some. Plus the kitchen forgot to make one of the dinners! By the time it came every one else was finished eating! Won't go back!! If the owner(s) expect this restaurant to stay in business they had better take service seriously!! Otherwise, no one will be repeat customers and they'll be out of business within six months or less!!
