WARNING: Go Wild is sliding down hill quickly. I won't be back, especially with Lucky Fish now happening two miles away. 

Quality is now below acceptable, roll size has shrunk, service is as bad as other reviewers mention. 

I had to sleuth out what was "off" in my roll. The culprit? Rotten carrot. Well, at least it wasn't rotten fish, but you know, if they can't do produce right, its not worth the gamble with the raw fish. 

Sionara, Go Wild.
