As we were being seated I was greeted by a cockroach on the wall who made its way on the conveyer belt. A staff member did pursue to roach but I was unable to confirm his kill. I still decided to give this place a try and it legitimately made me feel sick and it was not my first sushi experience or anything like that. I don't know if I'm just really unlucky but non of the sushi from the conveyer belt was even kinda fresh. My recommendation is to pay a bit more and actually enjoy your food and not struggle to finish.
