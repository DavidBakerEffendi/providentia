It used to be good. WHAT HAPPENED?

Long story short, take the trek up to Restoran Malaysia instead.

 It will be a longer drive, and perhaps WAY out of your way (you will need a car, no TTC), but it is TRUE Malaysian fare for cheaper!!!!!

The food is not authentic, the curry is lackluster (no flavour at all), the Beef Rendang is too soft (some might like that), and lacks in flavour.

The rice is too mushy (they overcooked it and added too much water), and this is just not what I consider to be good Malaysian food.

The only good thing on the menu was the satay, but even that, I was not sold.

The desserts were okay though. Sago Sago and the Pandan Crepe was all right, but not for $8 each. I'd say $5 each considering that it isn't THAT amazing.

I also find the restaurant too dark (so sue me, I don't like to strain my eyes) and the service was slow and awful.

The head manager (Indian I think he said he was), was on his cellphone the entire time, ignored us, didn't fill our water glasses in a timely manner, and the food just took too darn long.

I don't think they prepared a proper mise en place to be ready to serve the food fast, and there wasn't Roti Canai or any other delicious meals I'm used to having in Toronto.

For $90 for 2, we didn't feel happy or full, and I wish I had just eaten some cheap pho instead of wasting money on that meal.

I'm so disappointed, I will never go back there again.
