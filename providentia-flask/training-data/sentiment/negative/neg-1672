This place is literally the worst. I live down the street and have been here twice and the staff never knows what they're doing. They told me they didn't have bloody mary's when I could actually see a bottle of bloody mary mix sitting on the bar. Then I had to tell the girl making me drink that bloody mary's are made with vodka. Another girl tried to give my boyfriend a beer that was literally have foam and ask if it was ok. The staff is so incompetent, I really don't think it's they're fault, but they obviously have received no training. I wish I hadn't given this place a second chance, I'm still waiting for my bloody mary and just want to leave. I never give 1 star reviews but this place really deserves it.
