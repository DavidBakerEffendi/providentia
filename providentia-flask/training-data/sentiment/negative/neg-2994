So sad my experience! I went there, ate lemon chicken, not spectacular and when I was trying to pay, the machine never connected with the bank and I couldn't pay in that way! I offer myself to go to the bank to get cash but the woman in the cashier start to yelling, really rude her manners.. They send me a waiter to go with me to the bank with the order of don't give the change (3.20 including tip of 13%) until he receive the money from me. Really very upset and offended with all the treat received from that women. I'll never come back to La Casita :(
