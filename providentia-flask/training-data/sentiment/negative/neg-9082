It smells odd and no air-conditioning so it's hot. Yeah, it's a tiny place but there's still no reason to have minuscule, uncomfortable tables and booths. Maybe we were there on an off day, after reading other food reviews and hearing about their "great nachos", but we thought the food was awful. Burgers were dry, tasteless and almost inedible - we left half of each. The nachos were small, and very plain jane. We left annoyed, hungry and feeling ripped off.

If it were just the food, we'd give it another shot, restos have off days, but there was nothing about this place that appealed to us, so we won't be back. There were regulars there that seemed to be having a good time. More power to them, but we didn't see the charm.
