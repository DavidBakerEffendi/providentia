I've been here for the lunch buffet on a Friday and was subjected to some of the worst Indian food I've had in eons. The naan was apparently abducted by aliens and replaced with some flimsy, soggy flatbread just-a-tad-thicker than a tortilla in its place. The saag paneer was way mushier than it should have been and the chana masala seemed to have left the masala in some other zip code. The grilled tandoori chicken was pink inside and blander than a Jewel CD. Actually, the word bland encapsulated pretty much all of the food I had there. And don't forget the oil. Oh, the oil. Those dishes on that buffet table carried enough to fuel atleast 10 biodiesel big rigs.

Gah.
