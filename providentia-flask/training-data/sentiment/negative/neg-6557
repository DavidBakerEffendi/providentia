Came here when i was in town based on the good reviews on Yelp.  Ordered a rice dish with meat (forgot if it was pork or beef)) , and it was 80% rice, 10% vegetables (tomatoes, lettuce, etc.) and 10% MEAT! My grilled skewer had 4 EXTREMELY SMALL pieces of meat on it, not even enough to fill up the whole skewer.  It was obvious that they were being stingy on their meat. The portion was so sad.  I've been to many Vietnamese restaurants in different cities (and even others in Charlotte) and have never been served so little meat for this dish.  Basically paid for a plate of rice and some vegetables. Some of my friends' dishes were better, but as for mine, it was so pathetic that I would never recommend anyone to come here.  Wish I might have had a better experience by ordering something else, but a restaurant can't skimp out on their main ingredients so obviously like that.  One of my friends ordered the Pho and it was lacking on meat, too..but not as badly as my dish.

Only thing I liked about the place was the Vietnamese coffee, but that's definitely not enough to redeem them. Not ever coming back here again!
