The mark of a good restaurant is not necessarily its size, but the quality of its food and the generosity of its staff. Along that line, some of the finest dining experiences I've had throughout my career have been in the small diners and dives scattered throughout the suburbs.As we went in we got a very cold reception and told us to wait for 15 min. we did not bother much about their reception and 15min wait was reasonable for a table of 6 on a Saturday evening at 8 o clock.
As we were seated we had to wait for 15 min for some one to notice us and take an order ,as nobody showed  we had to call one of them to take our order.The lady who took the order was young.we ordered our food amongst which were tuna sushi ,thai basil & pineapple fried rice also.once the order was placed she repeated the order and she asked us for the spice level on a scale of 1 to 5 .5 meant thai hot, so we told her hot was good.once the food arrived we ate sushi and was good.With the same expectation i started eating pineapple fried rice and it was hot as hell and to confirm i asked one of my friends to take a bite and they had the same reaction too.The other fried rice my friends ordered was supposed to be equally hot as we mentioned hot for both pineapple & Basil.I took a bite of their fried rice it was not even close to Hot.So we called out for the young waitress and explained to her what the problem was her reply to us was" when i say hot you should assume it is thai hot.Another waitress just stormed in with a slip in her hand even before we explained anything to her she started talking and telling us"you asked for thai hot and that is what you got and that is what was written down while taking your oder".When my husband tried to talk to her and tell her may be there was a miscommunication she told my hub"HOLD ON"in a very uncivil mannerly and to us that "i cant help you if you cant handle the spice level".Again the young waitress immediately came back with the bill and when my friend tried to place a take out for her son she replied rudely that the kitchen was closed.There was no prior notice that the kitchen was closing,in most of the restaurants they usually ask for last order before closing the kitchen.We paid for the food with 20% tip and left.There are many reputed restaurants where people replace your dish if you don't like it.Some restaurants don't even charge you for the food if you don't like it.But there they acted like they were serving free food and we had to jus eat without any complaints.
service industry is all about experience and hospitality but in case of this restaurant it is just not true.The waitress did not care to replace the dish nor took it of the bill. This review is to help others and not for free food.
Visiting Bahn Thai was certainly an experience to remember, but one that I never hope to repeat and would not wish upon anyone.
