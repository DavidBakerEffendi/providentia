Here's a nice place to spend your night, (it will take all of it) if that's alright.
There is no depth beyond the bar, 
and the kitchen is sub-par.
How do I know? I had a view, 
and what I witnessed was a zoo. Servers running in AND out with empty trays and pursed-lipped mouths. 
Empty glasses, cold-served food 
and frazzled waiters dodging you.
If there's a place I'd recommend, 
Give ear to me my famished friend. 
Get up from here and move your feet 
To any other on this street.
'Cause life's to short to waste your time,
Just ask me, I wasted mine!
