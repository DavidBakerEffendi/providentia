Grew up going to PB, with so many great memories and meals there as a kid! Unfortunately my last outings as an Adult at the Pickle Barrel at Sherway then at Promenade... and yes I tried once more for old-times'-sake, we went to the PB at Yorkdale this week. It was awful. My dinner guest ordered the deli-trio, all of the buns were stale. Not even a pickle was served with the deli-sandwiches - that just seems wrong! We couldn't find out which type of meat was on which bun, however much later we discovered by poking around in the sandwiches minus the stale buns, that they mixed all three meats on each sandwich, this seems weird - since my guest actually wanted to discover whether she preferred Smoked Meat versus Pastrami versus Corned Beef. Our server never came back to ask how our meal was. Washrooms had only cold water. Do the servers use these same washrooms to wash their hands as we do? If they do, that is scary too. The toilet did not flush. Fire alarm came on during our meal - since no one was running, and we didn't smell smoke, we finally managed to remove our hands from plugging our ears to wave our server over - she said it was the monthly fire alarm test. At this point, we told her about the stale bread and she said 'oh'. On a positive note, I ordered the beef brisket wrap which was tasty and juicy. I guess that I will just have to hold on to those special childhood happy PB memories, sorry that there will not be any new ones ever made. Bye-Bye Pickle Barrel.
