The host was respectful and friendly, and I was seated quickly. The house wine was the worst Cabernet I've ever had. The waiter took 13 minutes to get to me, but did help me with a selection. I ordered the Lamb Nihari and steamed rice with nan. The nan was good. The rest... not so much. I didn't claim the free dessert from the yelp coupon, I just wanted to get out. One waiter was very kind, but my own was on the edge of disrespectful. I absolutely will not return ever! Horrible experience. I went in hoping to try something new and exciting, I left feeling disrespected and disappointed.
