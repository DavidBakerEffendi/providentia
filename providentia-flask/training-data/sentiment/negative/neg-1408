Went here for Easter brunch different websites said they served till
4 not true closed at 2 then dinner started at 3
Lots of poor quality food for 27.95 plus tip and drinks 
Casino has become dark and dirty only go if no other restaurants are open
In neighboring areas. Shrimp small and fried, peel and eat shrimp not deveined, salmon on buffet tough, lemon pie no flavor, great rolls and garlic toast. Rest of pastry from cheap bakery. Better off at local grocery stores 
Didn't try prime rib or crab legs or lamb. All meat tough in my past experiences
