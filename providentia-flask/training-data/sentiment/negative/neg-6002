This place it horrible!! They are rude to you.. The fries are always hard.. You wait in the drive thru for at least 30 mins most days and when u go inside, expect to wait even longer.  This place should be shut down! Their employees can be seen on the side of the building washing their cars on the weekend.  Just completely trashy and ghetto bojangles!
