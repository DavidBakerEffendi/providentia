One of the worst buffet that I have ate at Vegas. The only eatable food was the ice cream and donut. The employees weren't helpful at all. Many of the employees just stand in the entrance. If you want to ask something at the cashier area they will make you feel uncomfortable. Just order room service to save your time. Never going back their again.
