Decent food. Terrible service. 

Waiters and waitresses regularly ignore you and serve their favourite customers. Avoid this place if you want to be treated like a human being. Come if you can stomach below average food and be treated like garbage.

This is a pretentious restaurant and charge you extra just to sit their "VIP" room. What a steaming load!
