3 of us went here for dinner yesterday. We ordered the veg thali just to get an idea of how the food was. The appetizer we got was the veg pakoda - not very bad, but just ok - pretty bland though. The soup had nothing but ginger in it. We got 2 curries of our choice. Among us 3 we ordered bhindi masala, palak paneer, dal makhni, paneer tikka masala, kadai vegetable and mutter paneer. Other than the palak paneer, nothing was even remotely good. The plain naan was ok. The rice was old. The desert - gulab jamun - was burning hot but was not bad. Service was good, but they definitely need to get a good cook. One star is only for the service. Bottomline is food was very bad and I would never go there again.
