Just got a bad vibe about this place glad something replace the old Landing nice to have something close to home. Been in about 3 times now most part found the menu to be generic, service is hit and miss. Waiting on our food every time we been in we have under cooked, burnt, SLOW!  
Management needs a overhaul! Had a great waitress she was friendly but heard her get in trouble because our burger was burnt and it took forever to come to the table. She apologized for the delay we told her sorry we complained it was not her fault it was burnt; she not cooking it. 
Grown up mac and cheese was very good & deep fried pickles were delicious.
