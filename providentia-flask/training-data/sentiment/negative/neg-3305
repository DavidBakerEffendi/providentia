This is my favorite breakfast place to go to and I've never had a bad experience till today. And it was 100% the worst food service experience i've ever had!! i came here on a Friday morning during winter break thinking since ASU isn't in session and everyone was home it'd be quick?- nope! It's usually pretty quick here anyway, I come all the time on Sundays when it's super crazy, sometimes I can't even find a table to sit at. Today it wasn't that busy at all but yet I waited for my food for an hour and a half!!!!!! When i noticed a few people who had ordered after me got their food already I went up and asked them to check on my order and explained how long we had been waiting and how people who ordered after us had their food they said "sorry 20 more minutes". 2 girls sitting next to us that had ordered before us didn't have their food either! Clearly someone messed up our orders. I decided to just get a refund and leave. So did the girls next to us! and of course that took like 15 minutes. 2 hours later I'm starving. I'm usually never a person who does something like this but that was horrible.
