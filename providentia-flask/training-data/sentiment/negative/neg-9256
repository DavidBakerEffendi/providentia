I was really disappointed with the menu. I like vegetarian options, but this is a vegetarian restaurant without healthy options. The one savory dish that looked appealing was chili with cornbread. It's pretty hard to mess that up. However, the cornbread was way too sweet.  It was either a pumpkin spice or honey cornbread. The jackfruit sliders were gross. If you have had fresh jackfruit before, do not get this dish. We also had the nachos.  They were the worst.
