The worst Thai Express I've tasted in Canada. And the worst chicken noodle soup I've tasted in my life. Absolutely no taste at all. And the girl at the cashier has terrible attitude. No expression on her face. No willing to open her mouth to talk to customers. It seems that the whole world owes her something. When I asked her for a soup spoon for my noodle soup, she's like I owe her big! And I had to leave the noodle soup with just one sip because it tastes so bad. And no vegetable leaves at all.
