My son Dyaln was celebrating his 24th birthday at the Venetian. He had booned for his a two nights stay in the Bella suite. On the night of his borthday he and his friends tried to go into the TAO bar. After all of   his frieds were admitted Dylan then proceeded to enter the bar. Upon carding him the "bouncer" decided that my son did not look loke the picture on his driver's license. After showing several other credit cards and other forms of I.D. the bouncer would still not admit him. He then went to the hotel desk nanaager and spoke with Christopher Cauaaugn. Dylan was hoping that at least the hotel manager could get him in. Mr. Cavanaugh did not! The hotel did NOTHING to remedy the situation. His birthday was ruined.I just got off the phone with "Nate", the daytime desk manager, he too did nothing to remedy the situation. They claim they are not affiliated with the bar and cannot intervene. I'm sure when my son goes to pay for his hotel room in the morning they will not have any problem accepting his I.D. and credit card info.  I WILL NEVER book a room at this hotel again.!!
