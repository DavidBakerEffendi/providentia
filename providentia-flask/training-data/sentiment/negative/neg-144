This Tap Haus has 60 taps, almost entirely craft beers (several faux crafts like Blue Moon).  Open room, mixed atmosphere of wealthy cave creek old folks and bikers in Harley black leathers.  Service was atrocious.  Dirt parking though, meh.  Food is American meat focus on steak, chicken, fish plus a lot of fried apps.

Update: had to leave bar without being served - after given menu, was ignored by bartender after numerous passes and a raised hand... and it wasn't busy at all.
