Before flying home from a business conference I had dinner at the Buffet at Bellagio, I figured it would be fine, and I did not want to hassle with taking a taxi to the familiar Orleans (my favorite Vegas buffet) or the Rio. Boy was I mistaken, $37 for a buffet that had less than a third of the selections of the Orleans or Rio at more than double almost triple the price. The food was nothing like the banquet meals we were served for the conference. The food was bland, tough, and boring. If I knew it would be that bad I would have eaten at the airport. Ok maybe not at the airport, but there are many excellent restaurants in Vegas for about the same price.
