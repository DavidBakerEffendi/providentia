I have been coming here for years. And this place has made me very upset. Apparently this place will cater to pimps, and hoes. And drunks waking in at 3am. But when you, a normal human being trip and fall one time this place won't want you back. Better not waste your time if your sober and fall. This is a terrible place to come. Don't spend your money. Find a better coffee shop to go to. This place has lost my business forever. And if they treat everyone like crap, I hope you all won't go back.
