We have been here before a time or two and never found it anywhere near excellent, but not terrible either. The Restaurant Week menu caught our eye on the night we checked into THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay (August 29, 2013) and it seemed like a OK choice given proximity and our advanced state of hunger from traveling.

And the food was not bad. It was not excellent or distinguished, but it was not terrible. 

But the service was memorable, memorably terrible! -- perhaps the worst we have ever had anywhere, and we dine out A LOT.  

The appetizer (mussels in a curried broth) took forever to arrive and then weren't the mussels we had ordered but clams. We refused the erroneous plate and I guess that was more than our waiter was willing to tolerate. From that moment on he was openly rude at table, unwilling to acknowledge efforts to contact as he glided around the mostly empty room ignoring us, never did bring the biscuits that we paid extra for, all in all as hostile, surly and obnoxious as he could be. It took over an hour from the time of the appetizer failure for our entrees to be served, and they had cooled to virtually room temp by the time the waiter deigned to serve them. Two different bus persons apologized for our waiter's conduct, so obvious was it that he was acting out inappropriately. But no manager appeared to salvage our dining experience. 

We left deeply disappointed in our choice among so many good restaurants in the Mandalay concourse. Rick M seemed like a really dedicated chef the season that he was on Top Chef Masters. I wonder if he has any idea what abusive and unprofessional waiter practices are going on in his house and his name in Las Vegas?
