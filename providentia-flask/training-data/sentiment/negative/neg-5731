i was definitely a Gallo go-er and was skeptical about this new restaurant imitating Gallo food. here's what i found when i went a couple weeks ago...

Happy hour is no longer very happy there. Prices went up... drinks aren't the same  or even better. Options went down and margs and paloma are just ok. I highly doubt we will be there two to three times a week like we use to when it was Gallo. It's just not worth it.  In fact, we didn't even step in there not even once last week and it's only 100 yards away. Kinda sad I no longer have a watering hole at my door step. :(
