Placed an order online for pick up, received an email confirmation and noticed my order was incorrect. I tried calling the store immediately to confirm, but was left on hold for 10 minutes on two phones before being hung up on. I called back again and was placed on hold once again before someone picked up. When I spoke to them I was informed that my order was already done. I told them about the hold situation yet they weren't able to correct my order because they were "out of pan dough".  I chose to cancel my order and have the sale voided. When I asked if there was going to be any email confirmation of the voided sale the employee basically told me to take his word. I decided to drive to the location and have a physical copy of the voided sale printed for me. All in all, complete lack of customer service. I will not be placing any future orders at this location!
