while I have had worse pizza I really disliked my pizza. almost no cheese. the wood fired oven burns parts of the pizza.  good if you like extra crispy pizza. I do not. it was more like cardboard. and burning pizza doesnt help keeping it from tasting like cardboard.  I looked at the table next to us and the one behind and their pizza was burned also. then I remember seeing the place on the morning news and it coming out burned and I said remind me not to go there. so my mistake I went to try it.  why this place is on national best pizza lists confuses me. I have had pizza in ten places in nyc that are far better. I am guessing they use real moz.  but most of the pizza had no cheese. so yeah im very disapoointed. my budy warned me that it wasnt that great. and I posted this on facebook asking. no one I know likes this place. so do not be fooled by it making best of lists. and the service. never came back to ask how the food was. so I didnt bother telling them it burned.  they have soda bottles like mexico.and today out of diet coke. What kinda pizzeria doesnt have a soda fountain. the one meal that soda really is required along with mexican. and the old chair I was sitting in was rock hard. the problem was that it wobbled.  terrible restaunt. avoid it please. dont say I didnt warn you
