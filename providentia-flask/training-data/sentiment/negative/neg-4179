5/9/14: I saw they had remodeled so I decided to give them another try.  As I approaches the door I was greeted with clouds of cigarette smoke from the server who was standing at front corner smoking.  I approached the podium and waited.  Another server was on the phone and I heard her mention "Medicaid".  Since that is not an item served at Coco's, I assume it was a personal call. Eventually she said she would be with me in a minute.  She then leaned against the back counter and continued her call. Based on previous bad experiences, my smokey entry, the lack of making guests the first priority, and the district manager never following through on her previous call to me, I will never return.  I will share my experiences with everyone in my office as well, which is just down the street - over 300 people.  

3/7/13: No change.  Slow service to be seated.  Poor maintenance. Tables had excessive wear marks from use as plates sliding across them.  Dirty walls near booth.
