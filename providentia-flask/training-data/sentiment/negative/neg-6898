Went in this afternoon, and after watching Bar Rescue Im much more aware of things. First, took 10 mns to get the server. Ask for drink recommendation and was served in the same glasses I bought at Walmart with a white straw. No drink glass or drink straw..thumbs down. Ordered the boneless buffalo wings, took 20 mins to get the food. It comes out in a stand that you serve fries in. Food was awful, and was more like chicken nuggets. The drink had no liquor in it.  I wont be going back. Its too bad because I have had food there before and drinks and it was decent.  Oh yea, the cherry on top is that Ive had gas for 5 hrs since eating there. UGH!!!!
