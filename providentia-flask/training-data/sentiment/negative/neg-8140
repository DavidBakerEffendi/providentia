I was very disappointed with BLD's service.  I have been there a number of times - the food is good.  But the service is so poor.  This last time I was there, our server did not come up to us for almost 20 minutes and that was just to get our drink order.  She was rude, unhelpful, did not know the menu, had no suggestions.  Then when we told her we were ready to order she no joke blankly stared at us.  So there was this awkward silence and I just started ordering.  Then she interrupts me to say she will be right back to take our order.  WHAT?! alright.  So anyway, i'm looking at my bank account statement today 2/2/2016 (I was just at BLD on Sunday 1/31/2016).  And I see I was charged twice for the same thing on the same day.  I am like, great!  I was already not happy with my experience from there.  Then this.  My rent just took out and I overdrafted because of them double charging me.  So obviously I call them right away.  This rude girl answers the phone - doesn't give her name.  And basically tells me there is no manager and there is nothing she can do about it.  I even told her about how I overdrafted and this was affecting my account and me paying my rent.  She did not seem to care at all.  Told me to call tomorrow.  CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?  Like what kind of place runs their business like that.  I will not ever be back there again.  OH AND even though there food is good for the most part.  They do not know how to poach an egg for the Egg Benedict's, and that specific plate typically comes out cold.  THAT IS ALL.
