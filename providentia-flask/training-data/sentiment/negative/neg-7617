I'm gonna go with a no on this one... I have been to Dick's before and I get the gimmick... BUT when the waiter walked across our table with his dirty a$$ shoes... NO.  I get restaurant themes...  BUT I did come to eat.  You can't mess with that.

Oh and when my friend asked for silverware for his salad the waiter kept his dumb Dick's attitude and told him to use his hands.  I get that he was just playing, but by the time the silverware actually arrived (10 minutes later) the rest of us were halfway through our meals.
