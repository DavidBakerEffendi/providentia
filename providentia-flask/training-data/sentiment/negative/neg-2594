Pulled in to this restaurant en route to San Diego...I have lived in Chicago all my life and the Rallys on the Southside moved twice as fast as this place! I mean 20 min in the walk up for two entrees?? I got full on my pop before my food came. Cheese wasn't melted on my burger..smh..Come on yall...we gotta do better
