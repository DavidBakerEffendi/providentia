I love petes... but not this location. I try to be loyal to the mesa dr location, but sometimes I have to come to this one because I work and go to school in Tempe. This location is probably one of the slowest drive thrus you will ever see. I was in a rush to go to work, and I ordered a number 4 and asked him to upgrade the drink size, the worker was like "it already comes with a large drink", and I'm like I know but can you please give me the even bigger one (the 44 oz). He said sure and then I got up and paid and he brought out the 32 oz, I didn't even complain or say anything because I was in a big time hurry to go to work, but then I waited probably another 10-15 mins for the food. Nobody else was in line, and I was the only car in the drive thru... love Petes, but if you can go to the mesa dr location unless you aren't doing anything else in your day and have the time to wait.
