My husband and I decided to try this place out last night. Big mistake. To begin with, the food was not very impressive. The salsa had an interesting flavor that both my husband and I did not enjoy. The chips were bland and greasy. We ordered the spicy cholula wings, and they were not up to our expectations. I ordered the street tacos and they were pretty good, they just lacked flavor. My husband disliked his green sauce chicken burrito and thought it was bland as well. 

So even if the food was not great this first time around, we possibly may have come back. That is, until our waiter "Ishmael" COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT US halfway through our meal and left us waiting for our check for 30 minutes. Yes, that's right. We kept waiting and waiting for him to show up to our table and he completely vanished... Even the other waiters nearby saw us waiting and decided to ignore us as well. I have never been to a restaurant with such horrible service. Eventually I had to walk to the waiters station and ask someone for the check because they were wasting our time. Even up until the moment we left Ishmael never showed up to our table again! I will Never come here again and will strongly discourage anyone I know from coming here. I'm extremely disappointed with the service from this restaraunt ... How can you completely ignore your PAYING customers??!
