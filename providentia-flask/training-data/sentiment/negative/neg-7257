First of all be careful when u use your debit card in there. They double charged me. When I went back they deny everything. I even showed them my online bank and they still deny it.  I had to yell at them so everyone can hear then finally the manager came over and she's like sit down, don't talk loud..lol
Then my friend came to visit me from Toronto for her B-Day before Stampede and since the ONLY place open late was this one.
 Is not like in Toronto with many great Chinese restaurants open late. Is really embarrassing that the only place in Calgary to eat Chinese food is this place where they reap you off, the waitresses act like they are gang members and the food is getting worse and worst everyday more dirty inside.
So we ordered the $18-$18 fried fish. She came out and brought us a $29 fish, saying the other one not available. We didn't say anything because we we're hungry. We thought if we complain they will spit in our food. We only wanted to pay $18 the one we ordered. They geab the take out food out of my hand and pushed my friend down the stairs. What a great welcome to Calgary stampede.
