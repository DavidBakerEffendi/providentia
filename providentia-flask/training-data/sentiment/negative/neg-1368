Came in and didn't know much about the restaurant. My friend and I just knew they served cool desserts so that's what we we're looking for. The menu is very confusing, they do have English translations but if you ask the servers what the item is they can barely give you an answer. So when my friend and I ordered we kind of went in blind. When we got our food, I was kind of overwhelmed and underwhelmed at the same time. I got the chocolate bread, and I was disappointed. It just seemed like a really thick piece of wonderbread with some burnt chocolate on it. Nothing else was done with it, just served to me like that. My friend got the snow ice, and got a mountain of ice cream. She didn't mind it, but didn't love it. I didn't like it much, but that's a personal flavour thing. 

The reason for the one star is because service was so terrible. We were ignored and when they finally came over to us, they barely helped us, or were just shoving food in our faces and walked away. If we said "thank you" they would ignore us.  The staff needs to learn the menu better and needs to learn how to explain it. Sometimes people outside of your regulars do pop in to try new things. They should encourage this, not discourage and make new customers feel unwelcome and like they don't belong.
