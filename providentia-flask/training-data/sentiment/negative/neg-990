I've got nothing nice to say here, so I'll keep this short. I don't need to deal with your attitude for asking two questions about the menu, nor do I need or even want to deal with your smartass remarks when I simply spelled my name out for you for the order. I would just like to order a sandwich in peace, have a clean table to sit at, but I guess at Panera, especially with Kyle as your cashier, that's a tall order. Food was mediocre, but the service was unnecessarily rude.
