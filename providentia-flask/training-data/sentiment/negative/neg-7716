Overall, I was very disappointed. The drinks were overpriced and the food was underwhelming. We went shortly after the grand opening, so I'm willing to forgive some of the hiccups with the service, but even on happy hour it was just very overpriced for what it was. I did really enjoy the surf and turf nachos, but even the burger was very bland. Who ruins a burger?! I want to love this place based on proximity and the nice atmosphere, but I don't envision heading back.
