Perhaps the owners got drunk on their own success. The ingredients used to make the fish balls have clearly changed for the worse. The fish balls lost its bounciness and worst of all it did not taste fresh. At all. Service has also taken a dive. We were asked to tip more because we didnt have extra change and were short one quarter from 15%. As formerly regular cuatomers we were shocked. I have not gone back since a year ago and strongly discourage anyone else from doing so
