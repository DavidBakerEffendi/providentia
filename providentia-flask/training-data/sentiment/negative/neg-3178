I am very surprised that the food here was awful, given the location.  This part of the GTA has such a large Desi population, I incorrectly assumed that bland and spiceless Detroit suburb grade food was not on offer.  WRONG!  Chicken was indercooked and under spiced, yet still tough.  The dal could have come from a tasty bite bag, and the Naan was over cooked.  Upside?  the service was prompt.  Next time, I will go back to the Dundas and Hurontario area.
