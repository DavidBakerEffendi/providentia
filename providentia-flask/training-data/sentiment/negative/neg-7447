I had the fried red snapper with jollof rice. Red snapper was raw! Crispy outside but the inside was raw and room temperature. Instead of frying a new fish, they took the bottom half of the fish to fry again. Since the fish had sauce, the fish didn't have a good flavor after it was refr√≠ed. I also tried the goat stew with black beans and rice. Rice was super dry, lacked seasoning and flavor. Goat stew was tough, it could have been cooked longer to reach tenderness. Beef patty was basic, I was expecting something similar to a Jamaican patty, dominican empanada, filipino empanada. It was a simple mushy meat patty. The dough was flaky , but the filling lacked flavor. The best thing was the hot sauce paste that came with the goat and rice dish.  Plantains were oily and not drained on a paper towel. It was quite disappointing. At the end of our meal, a roach popped up on the wall.  I have had African food and all types of food,  not impressed with this restaurant!
