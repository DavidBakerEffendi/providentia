Did this location get different management?? Am a reoccurring customer until recently. This restaurant used to have better managers and higher quality food but the place has gotten dirty and the food quality is going downhill. A manager tried seating us at a booth that was full of crumbs and the seats were dark stained from lack of cleaning. Ordered nachos and they were so oily and greasy that they were inedible. Ended up not eating anything.. So disappointed
