What ridiculous take out service. Doesn't matter if you order one thing or 4. They tell you 35-40 min. No worries. I'll manage. When you get the 9/10 the order won't be ready and you'll still be waiting. I've seen this with them being full and at times with on 2 tables. 

Order food at 719 pm yesterday. Got there at 804pm. For two items. Food wasn't ready. Kept telling me they are "packing it " and will need 5-10 min to pack the food. Waited 5 min and when I heard the guy respond back to the front staff asking for my food with a "it's getting ready, coming soon". I left. Last straw. Food is decent. Service and the wait absolutely ridiculous.
