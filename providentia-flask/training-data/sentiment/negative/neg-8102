Note: This review is strictly based on customer service. Unfortunately I didn't get as far as ordering any food or drinks.

I walked in last night and the place was packed. My boyfriend and I stood for about two minutes right beside the "please wait to be seated" sign waiting for the staff (who crossed our path several times) to just acknowledge that we were standing there. Two minutes (which actually feels like forever) come and go and nothing. I get that they're busy, but a simple smile, some eye contact, or an "I'll be right with you" would have done wonders! Customer service 101. Eventually I had to go seek out staff and ask if they were even open, or if maybe I happened upon a private event. I told one of the girls behind the counter that we were waiting to be seated and she just said "it just seems like people are seating themselves tonight"... um, WHAT? Whatever. Peace out, Spin. Get your act together.
