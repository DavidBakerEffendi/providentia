We ate here 7 months earlier and it was aweful. They offered us a free meal to come back and give them a second chance. So we did. We ordered the crab dumplings, calamari, stuffed artichoke hearts, and edaname. All were tasty and great. For entrees my wife tried  to order the Chilean Sea bass, but they no longer carry it. Suggestion take it off of the menu. So she ordered the Paella which was okay. Kinda bland. I ordered the Surf and Turf. About the only thing good about this plate was the mushroom sauce. The Filet was tough and the lobster tail the chef did not bother to take it off of the shell. It came with mashed potatoes that had zero flavor. It wasn't as bad as the first time, but they still need alot of work. Brittany our server was great. Very pleasant and attentive.
