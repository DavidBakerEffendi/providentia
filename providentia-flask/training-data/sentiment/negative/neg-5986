Upon first entering we got menus, we weren't given a child's menu so I ordered the only kid friendly item on the menu, grilled cheese ($3) I asked if it came with fries and the waitress said yes. We ordered the rest of our food (2 $5 items)
We ordered 2 drinks, coffee & Coke. It took a ridiculously long amount of time before our food even arrived, 45 mins when it was empty in the restaurant. When it finally arrived the table behind us (who arrived 20 mins after we arrived) got their food right after us. It was ok, nothing special. When we received the bill it was double what we expected because the waitress had said yes fries were included but they weren't. I wouldn't recommend this place even before the doubling of the bill for fries.
The waitress wasn't friendly at all and never checked on us.
