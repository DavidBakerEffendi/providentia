My friend and I walked in to this location when it was completely empty except for a few people at one table inside, one table outside, and a man at the bar. The host was talking to the man at the bar, and took his sweet time coming to greet us. We were just standing there waiting for him while he talked away. Then he gets to us, and is not friendly at all. He takes us to our table and goes to get water. We couldn't find the menu online, just saw the Yelp review while we were across the street, so we didn't know what would be on the menu. We saw that we weren't in the mood for what was on the menu, so we got up to leave. The host asked us if we were leaving, and rolled his eyes when we said yes! Wtf? Don't roll your eyes at me, that's so unnecessary. We weren't surprised at his behavior, however, seeing as how he didn't seem happy about us being there in the first place.
