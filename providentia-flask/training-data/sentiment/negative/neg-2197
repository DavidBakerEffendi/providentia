Worse than before.
Overpriced, and HORRIBLE service.

When a group says "We're really thirsty. Could you please bring water while we look at the menu?" You'd better frickin' BRING IT! 

Our waiter was pushy, rude, and S...L...O...W...
When we said that we weren't interested in hearing the specials, he read them anyway. 

He constantly tried to upsell us. Every order placed was followed by a pause, and "Well, you know what would be really good...?" followed by a big description of a more expensive item or an add-on.

The desperately needed water took almost twenty minutes to get to our table.

The table next to us, who was seated at least five minutes after us, received their water, drinks, and first course before we even got our water. 

Do I sound like I'm obsessing about water? In the desert, dehydration is no joke, and it's indicative of the quality (bad - very very bad) of service that we received.

The sushi was good, but not great.
The main courses were simple but extremely expensive.
All sides were extra.
We spent about $250 for three people on very basic food and a glass of wine each.

Never again.
Never never never.
