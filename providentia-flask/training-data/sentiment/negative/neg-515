My husband and I have been here nearly 30x in the past 10 yr and the food is great and in the past 10 years we had great service. But it's been 6 mnths since we last ate here and clearly something (the servers??) has changed. 

This review is about the awful service. Food = 8/10, service = -10/10. Our waitress upstairs forgot to place our order; and only placed our friends (we were on a dble date). When our friends food kept coming and ours didn't we realized something was amiss and asked where was our food. She seemed oblivious to what we meant even though we had discussed with her our two orders. Not sure if she's just distracted, bored or what?! The floor was dead quiet so she wasn't busy...to top it off she took no accountability and though she covered our last wine she did so begrudgingly w no real apology for a major f* up since it was too late for us to order and eat and get home in time for our babysitter. It would've been a waste of a night if not for our great friendly company :) we ended up reheating pizza for dinner at 11pm once we got home. Sigh.
