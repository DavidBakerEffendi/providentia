It was terrible for delivery. It was actually good for a few months and now the quality just went down to almost at the level I don't want to order from there anymore. I called for a large orderof padthais and 2 seafood Padthais do no have any mussles in them. It was the only thing I was waiting for. I walked in the place on a Monday and it was empty so I asked for drinks. The guys was like :"it's...uh one..." And the lady who sat behind him jumped in to say "two dollars". Wow they just try to upsale me I was annoyed so I left. Never again real Thai on.
