Am I the only one who absolutely hates this place?? There are no redeeming qualities--the food was barely existent on the plate, and wasn't even good! Also, the service was HORRIBLE. The waitress we had acted like she had better things to do than to come over and take our order...and it took her forever to bring us our checks. I had to be back at work by a certain time, but I got tired of waiting so I had to leave cash on the table. I will never ever waste my hard-earned money on a la-ti-da place like this again! Ain't nobody got time (or money) for that!
