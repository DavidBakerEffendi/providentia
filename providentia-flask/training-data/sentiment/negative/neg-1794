So, this is the former location of "Mind Over Batter" cake shop. I was looking for some cupcakes for my wife's birthday and the reviews for Mind Over Batter were very good. The pictures of the cakes looked great too. When I arrived and saw it was now Jalsa I was disappointed but since they also had cupcakes I gave them a try. I picked up a lemon, vanilla, chocolate chip and toasted coconut for a total of over $16. I don't know when these were made but I could've thrown them through a glass window. They looked great but all four were hard and stale. The frosting was bland and overall I was very disappointed. My kids wouldn't even eat them. When an 8 and 6 year old won't eat cake you know it's bad. I can't speak for their ice cream but they need to get out of the cake business. I won't be back.
