Never again. Little Caesars was better. Just sayin. I decided to try them. I ordered a thin crust Hawaiian extra crispy it was soggy everywhere. I ordered lasagna it was super burned. I ordered 4 extra ranches got none. Told them no salad got that lol. I had to walk the order back because I wasn't going to wait and hope to get a refund for. A driver. NOW IT WAS A SUPER FAST DELIVERY...they did refund it and the manager was cool once I got there.....other than try and tell me nothing was burned. BRO I WALKED 6 BLOCKS TO GIVE IT BACK...I THINK IT WAS BURNED. 


ORDER CAFE VERDE, FLAMINGO PIZZA, OR BOSTON PIZZA FOR GOOD PIE. 
IF I COULD GIVE NO STARS I WOULD!!!!!!
