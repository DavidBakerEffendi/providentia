i know they are supposed to have this *raunchy* jokey attitude in there. but my waiter was actually an asshole. he wasn't pretending. he was really aggressive with ordering and actually ignored us when we asked him to bring more napkins...or something. he kept on making snide remarks that weren't funny, so much that my friends and i were just pissed we were eating there. 
wasn't even my idea, i was dragged by the bachelorette party i was with.
i made him shut his face when i said some snide comments back to him and he didn't know how to answer.
plus, the food SUCKED.

vegas has so much more to offer. don't go to dick's. anywhere.
