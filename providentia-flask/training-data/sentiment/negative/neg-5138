I always thought this bar looked like a really cool place to have a drink. There's a PokéStop and Pokémon gym right outside. It is Tuesday morning, January 3rd 2017. My best friend went inside and asked to use the restroom and said she was going to buy a drink. She asked for a Bloody Mary and bartender named JB said he's not making that tonight. So she asked for a shot of Crown Apple and JB said you need to write to the owner about that because he doesn't have any of that in stock. JB made us feel extremely unwelcome and said he was nervous because we were parked out in front for a few minutes so he called security. We said we were just collecting a PokéStop and decided to check out this bar because it's in our neighborhood. JB said he called security because felt threatened by the car being parked outside with us two females. seriously? 
So she offered to pay for the drink. JB said it's not necessary. My friend put $20 in the video poker machine and tried to tip him five dollars for the Jack and Coke that she really didn't want and he tossed it back at her. What kind of place is this? I will never, ever come to this bar and I will tell everyone that I know to never come to this bar! Stay away from this bar! Please stay away from this bar. And make sure you definitely don't do Pokémon near here even if you're in the bar. It's not a friendly bar. There are other progressive bars and restaurants that actually welcome people who play Pokémon, but this place does not!
He threatened and said that he will call security for any reason. The bar was completely empty at 4:20 in the morning. wow! 
To the owner, can you please get a bartender that will make a Bloody Mary and can you please order some Crown Apple, because he said to tell you.
There are other bars that welcome people who play Pokémon and like to spend money and they will get the business. 
Your bar is completely empty.
You may want to think about your bartender.
