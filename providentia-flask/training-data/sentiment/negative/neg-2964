Wow, how this place has changed - for the worse. Had been coming here for years, and always asked for no onions. The staff was professional and respected my request. And although the staff is different now, I was trusting. Got home to good full of onions and giant pieces of nasty raw green pepper. Once I removed the onions and peppers, I had 1/2 of the container left. Then I took a bite, and only tasted salt. So I spit it out and trashed it all. Nasty!! Avoid this place. Many other options in the area.
