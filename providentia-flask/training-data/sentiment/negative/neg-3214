EDIT: Got the sushi because it was the first restaurant open in the neighborhood on a Sunday and I needed a quick lunch. Really, really bad idea because I got serious food poisoning after, to the point where I had to go to bed with aches and a fever. Spare yourself and don't go here. 

Wanted sushi but decided to give the ramen a try. What a mistake. It took forever to come and when it did come, it was barely edible. 

Noodles were soggy and overcooked, and the broth was basically salted water. I ordered the shio ramen but it was not pork bone soup by any standard. This restaurant should really just stick to trying to get their sushi right, which as apparent from the reviews, they are having some issues with. 

I was really hungry so I ate a third of it before I could eat anymore, but if I hadn't, I would have sent it back. That's how pissed I was at this audacious attempt to pass out crap as ramen.
