Our reservation was through Open Table at 11:45 - we arrived at 11:48 and she proceeded to tell us we would not receive Open Table points because we were late - I should have turned around right then and there. The place was pretty dead for Fathers day noon and now I know why - the service was horrific, twice I had to go to the bar myself to get a glass of wine for my mother in law and myself and once I went to the waitress station to get a coffee refill. Our waitress was brutal, worse ever. Food was meh. View was great and we sat outside on the terrace for awhile, we would have enjoyed the view and some beverages for longer but couldn't get a server to save our lives. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!

Note - This review just pertains to Emma at The Statehouse - the staff elsewhere in the hotel were amazing!!
