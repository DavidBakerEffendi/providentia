Periodically my wife orders online from Which Wich. I went down to pick it up, about 20 min after she ordered it. They hadn't even begun making our order because "the online system is down". So they had to print out the email and start from there. 10 minutes later the man behind the counter hands me the bag and I head out. I get home and discover it's the wrong order. 
They actually called before I was able to and my wife brought back the incorrect order. 
Then when she got there, they started making our food, so she sat around for 10 min. 
To add insult on top of injury they never even offered to refund our money, just a sincere apology from the cashier. Obviously, their system is still in disarray...
