I love Einsteins, I really do but I dread coming to this location because of the customer service. I think the manager must purposely hire the most unfriendly miserable people. One worker in particular, she's shorter and has short reddish hair. This girl looks like someone killed her dog every time I come in. No smile, no greeting just miserable. And also my eggs are ALWAYS raw when she makes them!! The first 2 times I let it slide, everyone has their bad days right? But the lack of customer service has happened literally every time I've came to this location.The whole staff here is awful and I go out of my way to drive to the rocky river location because of this. 

Tip? Retrain your staff, or fire them and start over. You shouldn't be in the food industry if you don't want to deal with people!
