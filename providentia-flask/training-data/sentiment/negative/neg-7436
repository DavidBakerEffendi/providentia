Okay I was born and raised here In Calgary as well my fellow reviewer's. I have been coming to this establishment on and off for years. Last night, my wife, two kids and I decided to eat here for dinner. I haven't been here for about a year or so.(My regular is Bonavista Peking house). It was very busy, but were seated right away. 
 The waiter took our drink order, water for everyone and two diet Cokes. 10 minutes later no diet cokes. At this time my three year old was getting a little hard to keep occupied, since he was getting hungry. Oh yeah forgot to mention the water did come right away. We also ordered our food when the water came. Chicken fried rice, salt & pepper seafood, and beef with green onion and ginger in a pot. 25 minutes later the food is still no where in sight. 30 minutes go by, and I finally ask the waiter what is taking so long. He says it is very busy and everyone is waiting, not just our table. No offer of apology nothing. That's what I can't stand about that chinese restaurant. If it were an Earl's or Moxie's, they would buy you an appetizer for your inconvenience or knock at least 10% off your bill. Their is no customer service whatsoever. I don't think they care if you ever come back. To top it off, my son had a pair of chopsticks on his lap when we asked for the cheque. The waiter asked if he was going to keep the chopsticks, as if he were going to "add" them to the bill. My wife and I were very insulted, accusing our son of stealing thier chopsticks. To conclude my review the cheque came to  $44.11 and we left $45.00. If we had exact change we would`ve left exactly the amount on the bill. The service and the experince was HORRIBLE. 

WE WILL NEVER GO BACK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
