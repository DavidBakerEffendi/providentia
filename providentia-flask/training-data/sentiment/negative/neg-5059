Me and my boyfriend decided to try this location out when we saw this from the outside, we were excited to try a new restaurant that serves authentic Korean food. So I order the chicken cutlet and my boyfriend order the beef bone broth soup, I was so disappointed when I saw the chicken cutlet but still gave it a try to see if the taste is okay. The chicken cutlet tastes like cafeteria frozen chicken patties or maybe worse. I couldn't even finish it so I left it. My boyfriend said the soup was just average or borderline average. Definitely not coming back here
