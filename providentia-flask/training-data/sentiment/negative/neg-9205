My friend and I decided to try this place. She ordered a fish sandwich. I ordered the fish and grits.

My friend bit into her fish sandwich and it was filled with bones 
The fish on the fish and grits was fried and filled with bones so that when I took a bite scooping it up with the grits, I almost choked.
The waitress had an very nasty attitude when we told her that the fish sandwich nor fish and grits shouldn't have bones as you could kill someone ... or at least warn someone 
below are pic of the bones that she found when she bit into her sandwich
