Third time I have been in.  Seems to be run by high school kids in the evening.  Dirty food prep line.  One of the girls looked so unfriendly and almost falling asleep as she slowly filled our orders.  Both times being in here is super slow and chaotic and not very easy for all the staff in the back.  I won't be coming back to this location.
