This is by far the worse steakhouse I've ever been to. Should have just driven the extra half hour to go to the keg instead of this crappy place. I made reservations on Wednesday night for a group of 5 for Friday night and when I called to let them know that we were running 5 mins late they said "we don't have any reservations made for you for today and we are fully booked we can't accommodate you" I was livid at this point. I asked for a manager and the lady said "there's no manager here right now I will call you back in a minute" and hung up. She called back and said "sorry, we found your reservation, your table is ready" my reservation magically showed up out of nowhere apparently. Looking back at this point I shouldn't have went there and took my business elsewhere but my in laws really wanted to eat steak and that's the only place close to their house. 
Once we got to restaurant at 7:30pm it was completely empty for a Friday night and I'm not surprised at that. The service here sucks! The food is bland everything was horrible! Our server Darwin was horrible, he took forever to come to our table to get our orders then once he arrived he took my husband and I drink order and then walked away without getting my in laws order. That was extremely rude. The food was horrible and they didn't have much selection. I will never ever come to this restaurant again even if I were offered a free meal. Such a disappointment and waste of $200. I highly recommend to anyone who is thinking of going to eat here to spend their money at the keg instead, it will be much more worth it.
