I don't like reading lengthy reviews so this will be short... 

1. Needs remodeling, cuts in the seats and I mean big ones. 

2. Food is ok, midnight diner off S tryon is wayyyy better. Cooks don't remember what you order. 

3. Discrimination!!!! went there on Friday night (@ 2am it closes at 3am) this past weekend and the door was locked with customers in there. The restaurant wasn't letting people they thought associated with CIAA in. Now I don't know how you can tell who's associated with CIAA when we were dressed normal. As much as that conference brings money to the city they should've been welcoming customers. 

Word of advice Landmark if you don't want to be associated with CIAA "affiliates" you definitely don't need to be located on that side of town.
