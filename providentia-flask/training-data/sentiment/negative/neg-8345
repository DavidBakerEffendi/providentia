Negative stars for this place. I should've known from a crappy experience I had there the last time I went. Went to fulfill my pregnant craving of clam chowder thought id give it another try. I wanted to buy a bowl of clam chowder to take home. The girl says no mamasita we don't have bowls to put it in. Really????? That all you got for me? Now even an attempt to find me an alternative? So I drove here for nothing???There's so many restaurants in this place one of them must have bowls to share with this restaurant right??????? Very disappointed. Tell management to get some damn to go plates and bowls for customers who want to order take out. Just a thought.
