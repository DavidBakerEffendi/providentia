I went here for their NYE party and was extremely disappointed. For $50 I spent most of the night in a nearly empty bar with music that was deafening so I couldn't even carry a conversation with my friends. They served free food which was good, and had beer samples. But nothing else promised was there.

I was there with 6 people at a table and we were constantly passed by, when hats were given out, and more to my dismay when they were giving out champagne for the countdown. They walked right by ignoring is and gave us nothing, although our servers were constantly preoccupied by their own friends and boyfriends. They forgot to pay attention to the clients who paid $50 to be there.

To top the night off, after 10 they began letting people in for regular cover charge, so they received everything we did and we paid 5X the amount. 

Not impressed.
