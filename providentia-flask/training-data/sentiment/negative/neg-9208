If it was possible I would give this less than one star. My daughter liked her shrimp stir fry. That's the only positive I have to say. The jerk chicken combo, 2 portions of chicken, I originally ordered curry goat n jerk chicken combo, but they were out of goat. Any how the chicken, 2 portions, consisted of 5 pieces of chicken, three parts of drum stick, not the whole drum stick, mainly the grizzled joint and a small chunk of meat. And the two prices of thigh were like the region around the butt area, all bone a sliver of meat. The pile of bones when I was done was greater than the meat I ate. I was constantly picking out bone fragments from the rice. My wife ordered goat and ox tail combo, the goat was 3 small pieces of bone with a ring of grizzle meat around it, each piece of bone was about 1 1/2 inches long. There were three or 4 small pieces of oxtail, you guessed it, mostly all bone. And so those of you who gave it 5 stars had a totally opposite experience. Any how maybe I should have gotten Chubz burgers next door.
