I was just craving dim sum and in this area so I walked in despite the moderate amount of negative reviews.... Omg, everything they said was true! Service is super slow. Taro cakes are soggy. Food was showered with msg. Definitely overpriced!! I wanted a quick bite and it took them almost an hour to get all the dishes to my table at 1pm. Should have just walked to Spadina. Oh and their chopsticks are sticky.
