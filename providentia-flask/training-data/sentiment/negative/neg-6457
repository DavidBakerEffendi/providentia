This place is a joke. Maybe I am missing something, but any remnant of Rat Pack or previous organized Las Vegas business elements (wink, wink, nod, nod) is not evident. Maybe stains they left behind. Seriously. Have you seen this place? The diner stinks like old grease and dirty dish rag. The fireside lounge, well, let's just say, I threw all my clothes in the wash that I was wearing when I sat on those sofas. It does not evoke any coolness of the rough and tumble Vegas that some want to believe. It's more of a slimy, seedy underbelly. I need to go take another shower.
