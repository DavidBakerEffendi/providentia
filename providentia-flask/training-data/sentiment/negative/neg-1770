It takes a lot for me to write a negative review.
I decided to stop here for a quick Wednesday night dinner. It was busy, but not a friday night busy sort of evening.
We opted to sit out on the patio-once we were seated, is where my experience at Half Moon went sour. We sat there for at least 10 min before someone came to take our drink order. Our waitress disappeared, and it took another 15 min for her to reappear with our drinks. I'm annoyed at this point..25 min just to get my drinks and you havn't even taken my order?!
In that time..about 3 other tables fill on that patio..those same 3 people get up and walk out because of the lack of service.
Our appetizer finally arrive i(we've now been there for 45 min), and I say "I was wondering if we were forgotten", and the food runner then decides to YELL AT ME. Yes, me, the customer. The customer who has been waiting close to an HOUR for a sandwich and a soda.
He screams at me, and I quote, "LOOK-the upper floor is packed, and we can cook only so much at a time"...and storms off.
What just happened here?! Did that employee seriously yell at me and try to school me on the workings of a restaurant?! 
We had been sitting there for so long that by the time we would have left, we would have been stuck waiting elsewhere anyway.
I couldnt believe the complete lack of service, courtesy, and the outright  rude employee, who needs a serious training course on customer service.
We ate our meal..chuckled at how insane it all was..the 'upper deck' is a 2 step elevated section inside so we had a good laugh at that too.
To top off the miserable experience, the food was below mediocre Over cooked, the cole slaw was awful, and we kissed any chance of our drinks being refreshed goodbye. It was like we were the exiles on a deserted island begging for a beverage. 
Half Moon will never see my hard earned pennies again. I'd rather run down the street to Sonic!!!!
