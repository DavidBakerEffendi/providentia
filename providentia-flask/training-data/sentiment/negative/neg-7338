Something changed when they moved from East blvd. I used to love this place but in the last 6 months I've eaten here twice and both times have been terrible. Their service has gone way down, and even worse than that the food and margaritas aren't good anymore. The house mix has gotten way too sweet and the drinks aren't consistent. You can order the same drink twice and each drink tastes different and could come in a different glass.

The food use to be good. Marco Polo was a big favorite of mine. The last two times I had this dish it was not good. The shrimp was rubbery and tasted gooey ... Not good.

I spoke with the floor manager last time but he just brushed off my comments and said, "we haven't changed anything."

I won't be back.
