Our family went for lunch on a Saturday to celebrate my husband's new job.  It was our first and last time going. The service and atmosphere was great but the food was really not at all and left all of us very disappointed.  The sirloin steak my husband got was okay but the salad he ordered came overdressed in ranch.....daughter ordered sidewinder chicken and fries and both were dry....my chili didn't taste great so I only ate two or three spoonfuls.....my baked potato was very dry.....babies got chicken tenders and fries that were too overcooked and too dry for them to eat.  Even my little boy said "It's too hard."  Menu seemed overpriced for the quality of food we got.  I had high hopes and expected a lot from the restaurant and wanted it to be a really good experience for my husband and it wasn't for us.
