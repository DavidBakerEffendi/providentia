I have never thrown food out; I paid nearly $15 and threw my meal out half way through because I just couldn't tolerate the flavour anymore. The miso carrot dressing was bland but the tempeh made this meal inedible. It was sour and not in a good way. Service was poor. They charge for additional sauce. Finally, it was mentioned that they don't accept the tap function when paying with a card as they should earn tips; the tap function elongates that. That is bold to say when you are a take out spot, with no seating and terrible service. I hated my experience so much that I didn't post it in my blog as I didn't want to impact tens of thousands of people from not going here. Bad. Bad. Bad.
