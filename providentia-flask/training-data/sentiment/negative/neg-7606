If I could I would leave 0 starts!!! I want to get pretzels like I always do when I am at the mall and I'll probably never do it again!!! One girl making pretzels had he hair flipped over her head so it would hand over the food she was making. There was another girl cleaning her nose I a  Mirror  right where everyone could see her. I thought I was going to barf! The only plus was the polite girl that was working at the register. Lots of girls there and the line was moving slow. Looked as thought only two of the 5 where actually working.
