I really want to like this place because it is really kinda cool, being underground and all that. But I have given it several tries and I just can't recommend it.  Had one mediocre meal and said , " we'll try again Went for my birthday and it was worse than Long John Silvers, albeit more expensive. Complaining (politely) only garnered more mediocre food along with a poor attitude.  Tonight we thought, Oh, we'll just try the bar for happy hour. Scott greeted us and seemed pleasant but Dale actually managed to take our order and deliver it without uttering a word. In fact, I thought he was not going to say a word at all until we left. But he must have overheard me telling my husband that NOTHING ( mussels or any of the mystery dipping sauces they came with ) had ANY flavor. The only thing I noticed was a strong smell of sewer. Anyway,  he said " oh! So Is your stuff any good?"  I said ," Meh. It's ok. but really bland". At which point he walked away, never to be heard from again. I asked for the check which Scot delivered. The bill was $ 43 and some odd cents and I left $6 and some odd cents. I don't care if he thinks I am cheap (former server, good tipper) because I will not return. Everybody says the economy sucks. I think peoples attitudes suck. When we go out to spend our hard earned dollars make it worth our while.
