I stopped there yesterday. I was served terrible food.  Old, mushy baked beans.  The "marinated slaw"  hadn't been stirred so I received unmarinated slaw.  The chicken was smoked to the point where all I could taste was the acrid fresh smoke of newly lit wood.  And no mayonnaise sauce on the sandwich, like I asked for.  Service was half committed to something else but not me, the customer.  The worst part about this kind of food and service is that the owner knows what is going on and is deliberately putting out bad product with a who-give-a-hoot attitude.
