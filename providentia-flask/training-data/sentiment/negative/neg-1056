I can't actually rate the food because we left before it got that far. 

Drinks and service were horriable - not to mention the fact that it was like 100 degrees in there. Ohh and they  seem to have worked very hard in the design to  fit the absolute max amount of people per square foot with zero regard for comfort. There are tables jammed into every possible space.
