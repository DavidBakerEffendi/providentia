I want to give them zero stars! When we first walk in there is already a family waiting and no host or hostess around to greet us. When the host walks by he tells us all we're gonna have to wait as he delivered food to someone outside. He comes back in and instantly walks to the back without a word. He comes out with a smug attitude, claps his hands and says "alright, no ones getting sat for at least 20 minutes" even though the restaurant is half empty!! When this is brought up he says that they are short on servers, which is understandable, however it was dinner time!! They should've been a little more prepared. Unfortunately this was my second time coming here, and although the food was good last time, I experienced the same terrible customer service the first time. It's too bad I will never ever go to this location again!
