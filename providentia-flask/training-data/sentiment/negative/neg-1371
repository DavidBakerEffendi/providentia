As some of you may know, I am huge fan of A&Ws, so it pains me to have to give this particular location only a single star. 

This A&Ws is located in Vaughn Mills inside the food court area. I was pretty excited to use my coupons to get either two mozza burger or two teen burger combos with my date. Before you say anything, you should acknowledge the fact that A&Ws is a step up from McDonalds price wise. Anyway, we decided to order two mozza burger combos, with root beer, and one combo with sweet potato pries instead of regular fries. We sit down at our table and look inside the bag. To our disappointment, we didn't get our spicy potato fries (which cost extra btw). So my hot date generously offers to go back and tell them what happened. While she is doing all this I discover that I got a teen burger instead of a mozza burger. LOL   Our time was wasted during this whole ordeal so we had to go, but I would have been too lazy to complain regardless. Not worth the hassle nor the risk of getting the wrong burger a second time. That would be embarrassing. 

The burger itself was delicious but I got the wrong type of fries. For some reason the root beer tasted flat. My date agreed, here root beer was flat too. 

Overall my experience here was quite unpleasant. My date was left disappointed and I was too. I would not recommend this place.
