I was super disappointed by the food from here. I was craving Chinese food and since I live far from my favorite Chinese food place (New Asian Kitchen), and was too tired to drive there safely, I decided to order from this place. I had the choice of trying this place or trying Autumn Court Chinese (for the first time for both) and I'm pretty sure I made the wrong choice. I ordered the crab puffs, which all I could taste was the green onion, and the orange chicken entree with steamed rice. The chicken was extremely bland and chewy and the rice was ok, just ordinary white rice which is kinda hard to screw up. I think the best part of the meal was the fortune cookie, which was just your run of the mill fortune cookie. I wish I could go back in time to warn myself to not order from here and to try the other place instead. Seriously, don't eat this if you enjoy actually tasting food.
