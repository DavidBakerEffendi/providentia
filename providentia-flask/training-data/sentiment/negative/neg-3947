I'm sorry but this place is trash! I called in my order as well as my friend.  We get there, my order was wrong. Supposedly I wasn't charged full price for the wrong order. My friend got her order n they looked horrible! She got garlic parmesean, whatever the sauce was on it was horrible. No flavor n dry. She also ordered fried zuccini as did I n they were not bad but not good. I open up my boxes of wings and they were dry and no flavor. I got spicy ranch n spicy bbq...ummm never again. I ate one and horrible. I also ordered jalepeno poppers, I threw those away too! Overcooked and tasted burnt. This place is not worth the money they charge. Also, they have a menu online, the prices are higher in the store! But didn't honor the price that is on the online menu. The lady said they changed the prices a couple months ago, well you should fix it or honor the price shown! I was EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED with this place. SMH.
