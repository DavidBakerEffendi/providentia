This was our first time at the restaurant and the decor and vibe was pretty cool and eclectic.

We sat and waited about 5-8 minutes to be greeted and get our drink orders taken which also gave us time to have our whole order placed appetizers and entrees.

We order the crispy pesto gnocchi which was pretty good but rich to eat alone. We also had the langosta bruschetta which had a beautiful display but underwhelming taste.

Our meals came out and we were not impressed. I had the shrimp tempura pasta with mushrooms. Looked nice, the pasta had a pretty good flavor but I could have gone without the breaded shrimp. It was soggy and I couldn't eat it at all cause the thought alone made me gag. My brother had the cheesesteak and they had kraft cheese on it and it was pretty bland. My friend had the clam pasta and it had so many shells in it but we weren't sure why.

We tried to pay for our bill and after waiting for 10 minutes we decided to just go to the host stand to pay. We literally could have dined and dashed and they would have never known (I would never btw but it was tempting at the level of disappointment we had)
