Yet another restaurant that was highly reviewed by Helen Schwab and ended up a disappointment.

On the day we visited, I started with the chef's featured soup, what was described as a tomato bisque.  What I was served was an ice cold bowl  of what seemed to be a blend of canned tomato paste and canned tomato sauce.  I don't normally expect tomato bisque to be served ice box cold, but the surprise didn't end there -- the "chef's inspiration for the day" (as the soup is described on the menu) was apparently to dump tomato sauce into a bowl, add no spices, salt or flavoring of any kind and have it delivered to the table.

My wife ordered the seafood risotto which comes with a salad. However, she wanted to substitute the beet salad for the house salad.  This was apparently too much for our waitress to process. 

Waitress:  "now you know the risotto comes with a house salad, right?"

Wife:  "yes, but I would like the beet salad instead"

Waitress:  "but it comes with a house salad.  I'll have to charge you more"

Wife:  "I assumed that -- I want a beet salad."

Waitress:  "OK.  Now, what kind of dressing do you want on your house salad"

Wife (stabbing her own hand with a fork):  "I don't want two salads, I'd just like the beet salad."

That was harder work than we expected at lunch.

I had the fennel sausage pasta for my entree -- it was fun to try to find the sausage in the dish.  It had to be hiding in there somewhere...

In retrospect, we should have left after they served the soup.  I can't recommend this place.
