Sat on the patio for just over an hour and not once got acknowledged by the staff or servers. Got no service what do ever. Sadly this is the second and last time this will happen. Band was barely just ok. Will never go back.

Thanks for acknowledging my review. We were there from about 9:30-10:30 pm. I was there a few months ago and sat inside and the exact same thing happened. We had to go up to the bar and order our own drinks. I noticed a lot of people just went and got their own drinks from the bar inside. Certainly not how I'd want my place to be ran. I would have not posted a review like this had this not happened previously. The first time I just chalked it up to the staff being busy or whatever. Hope you get it sorted out. Thanks.
