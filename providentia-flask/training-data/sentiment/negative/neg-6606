First watch acquired The Good Egg and now completely changed the menu.  I respect that the company has to push their image they want. But being a loyal customer for 6 years every weekend.  They have now lost my business.  No basic buttermilk pancakes or flavored ice tea.   The "multigrain pancakes" the last three weekends had be sent back as they were undercooked and raw batter. 

Pity as they didn't seem to care what the local patrons wanted. I completed a survey last weekend and asked to be contacted as well.  They never have.
