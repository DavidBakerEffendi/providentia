It is really sad to have to write a 1 star review for this place. The food 4 stars, the fact that it is family own and run is a 5 stars, but service that I have received from the manager, David is a -3 stars. 

On the first day that the Yelp coupon was released I bought it and used it. When I checked out, the cashier was confused because I was the first one to use the coupon. I later discovered that she originally charged my cards for the full price, $34.18. She then charged my card for $26.04. I know my math skills are a little rusty, but that is not a $14.00 discount, plus I was charged twice. That is not where the major problem lies. 

The major problem was that I had to make several phone calls attempting to get a hold of the owner or manager. When I finally did get a hold of David he told me that he did not call me back because he did not know who I was or what I wanted. He also stated that I "should have left him a message about what my concern was." First David, you should call everyone back regardless of if they leave a detailed message. Secondly, I was not about to leave a detailed message because the person that answered the phone each time struggled with their English to the point that they could hardly handle my name and phone number. I have no problem with the fact that they struggled with English, but don't provide me with poor service by not calling me back because I didn't leave a message under these circumstances.

Here we are more than 2 weeks later and I still am struggling to get my money back. If the owner reads this, then it would behoove you to reach out to me to resolve this. We were so excited to have found your place just 2 months ago. We were on our way to being devout customers, but this might have changed that, primarily due to David's attitude with me.
