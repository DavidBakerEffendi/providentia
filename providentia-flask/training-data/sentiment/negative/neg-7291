I'd say the best tasting item here were the fortune cookies. LOL

We started off with a wonton soup. It was THE worst wonton soup I've ever had. The broth was bland but the worst thing was the wonton themselves - too doughy and tasteless. Then came the shrimp imperial rolls. These were actually decent. Then we split a plate of basil fish. I'm not a fan of basil so I did not find these interesting whatsoever but my boyfriend did like these and wants to go back next time we're in Montreal.

I told him he's on his own on this one...
