This may not be a fair review, because I did not stay to eat. My review though, is based on the fact that this place is the exact same as Paradise Bakery. Not even the baked goods were different from Paradise. Same cookies, etc. I'm sorry, but are we sheep? Slap a new name on the items? I don't care for Paradise Bakery as it was. Panera USED to be much better, imo. I was at least hopeful to still get some of my favorite Panera baked goods. I truly hope it's just because they just opened.
