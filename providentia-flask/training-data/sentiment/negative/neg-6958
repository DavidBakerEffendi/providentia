Disappointing dinner. I should have read all these reviews before going. Like others have mentioned, the parking lot was empty. We seemed to be the first there. We had a restaurant.com coupon which reduced the price by $25. Even at that price we will not return. I noticed that everyone else that dined also had a coupon of some sort. 

Salad bar is minimal. Lettuce, salad dressing, some deli ham and cheese, tuna salad (or chicken?)  type of stuff. 

Meats ranged from okay to really bad. The chicken breast and lamb might have been spoiled. What they are calling filet mignon is not. The texture wasn't right at all. Meat was slow to come out. 

I would have rather paid more and gone to Texas de Brazil. This was like the Hometown Buffet version of Brazilian BBQ. 

I find it odd that the reviews for this restaurant seem to be really good or really bad. I can't help but wonder about the difference. Either there is a totally different experience on different nights, or someone is trying to manipulate the reviews.
