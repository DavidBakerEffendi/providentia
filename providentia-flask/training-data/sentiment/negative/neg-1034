I debated on 1, 2 or 3 stars for awhile, but I had to choose 1.  
However, let me explain. it was a Tuesday and I had made reservations a couple weeks prior for 6 people at 5 o'clock when they opened.  We had never been here before and we were celebrating 2 birthday's.  We were sat at a table by the front window on the bar side.  We were still waiting for 2 of our guests and we had read about their happy hour and wanted to participate in that as well if we could.  We asked the server if we needed to move closer to the bar to participate and he pointed out that we had to sit at the bar or the communal table with all the high top chairs.  We would have happily taken the communal table but our one older guest that was still on his way would not be able to hop up and sit in those chairs.  We explained that he is handicap.  He can barely walk far without taking breaks and recently fell and had broken ribs and even lifting his leg for a step is hard.  So he seemed very understanding, however he said he had to ask.  So he went to the bar and then came back to inform us that he was very sorry but that they would not allow us to participate in happy hour unless we sat at the high top and that they had to stick by their rules.  And so because you felt that your happy hour rules were more important then including a family with a disabled person, I had to stick to my rules and gave you 1 Star.  Our server was fantastic by the way.
