One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. I waited nearly ten minutes with servers walking right past me and not once did anybody say hi or offer to serve me. When I noticed the staff going to the tables that came in after me, I decided it was time to leave. There was a manager in the front so I told him that I was leaving because nobody came to serve me. He offered to serve me personally and to cover the bill, which I thanked him for, but politely refused. He then stood in front of me, blocking me from the exit, and tried to usher me back to the table. I again told him that I was no longer interested in dining in his restaurant, and he continued to try make me stay. I finally had to walk through him and leave despite his ongoing protest for me to stay. I will not be back.
