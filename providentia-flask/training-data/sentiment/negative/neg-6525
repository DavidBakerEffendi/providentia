Awful! I don't even think it's real fish! 1st off, there were only two cars ahead of us and the wait was still 20 minutes! Do they only have one fryer??? 

I got the 5 piece fish and chips (ate half) and had the worst gas (stomach) pains all night that I couldn't sleep! The fries were not very crispy. The fish was perfect crispy but square??? Hopefully it was 100% real fish..... 

For $11 I except a much better meal. I can go to a much nicer place at that price. Also did not like that they DO NOT take any type of debit or credit card, they are purely cash only and I can see why. No refunds..... nasty place. Don't go!
