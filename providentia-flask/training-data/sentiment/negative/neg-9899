When in to order a pizza at 11pm and was standing there for about 15 mins just to order 1 pizza. I've called out hello multiple times and no one can hear me. I can see the employees standing around talking to each other and not pay attention to the from. I didnt even get a sorry or a hello. Hands down the worse customer service ever. And please stop taking about your personal life, if you want to then make sure the customers aren't hearing you cuss up a storm about your personal life.
