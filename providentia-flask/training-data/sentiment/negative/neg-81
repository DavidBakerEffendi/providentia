As a person who is always on the lookout for new crepe spots, this one was a true disappointment. I actually yelped a crepe restaurant while we were on the strip and we purposely went to Paris only to go to La Creperie. You would think a crepe shop inside Paris hotel would be really pressured to perform up to a certain standard. All I can say was it was DEFINITELY not worth the price. 

The crepes itself didn't stand out. Mine looked like it was literally thrown together. The whipped cream was sliding off the crepe and pretty much off the crepe and on the side by the time we sat down. The nutella was plopped on the crepe like as a splatter. The presentation was simply just ugly. 

As for the service, I was appalled by how rude the lady was. I had asked if they had a crepe with strawberries and bananas, she said they could do the fresh berries with bananas. She then proceeded to tell me they charge for extra banana, which I was ok with. After getting my order however there were no banana. I asked her and she replied with "oh you didn't order banana, you asked for nutella." I replied with an assuredness that I DID ask for banana and she continued to be rude saying I didn't. I couldn't believe it. So I walked away an unsatisfied customer. 

Overall, never going back there.
