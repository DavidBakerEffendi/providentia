Food was OK but not spectacular. Service was horrible and took forever. We were seated and 15 minutes later we had to ask who our server was. We kept having to ask for water and drink refills. When our food came out they got 3 of 6 orders wrong and we sent 2 back. Instead of trying to speed things and make service better they kept wanting to bring us shots. Some of our party weren't drinking and we aren't in college anymore... Go elsewhere
