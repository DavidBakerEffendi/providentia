The biggest shame about this establishment is the service.  The food is good, but not worth sitting through the horrible service my husband and I have received, more than once.  With the young girls that work serving the tables chit chatting and giggling with a half full dining room, while we waited for anyone to show up to our table after 30 minutes of being seated, it was horrible that we were ignored, and blatantly so.  This restaurant lost our business for good.  We tried it out 3 times, and unfortunately the non-service we received was the 3rd time, and we walked out, nobody really cared.
