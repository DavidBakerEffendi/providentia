I can't do less than 1 star. Terrible service. Who wants to be served by a guy chewing a gum in front of you? I don't. My boyfriend either. 
The food is ok, drinks way too expensive. I could barely feel the tequila in my margarita. I have to say we didn't wait long for the food to arrive, but where was the Brie on my bruschetta? Couldn't feel a taste of it. Too bad. 
I used to love this place, I brought some friends and had a blast. 
Tonight is just the worst experience I have ever had. Won't come by again. For sure.
