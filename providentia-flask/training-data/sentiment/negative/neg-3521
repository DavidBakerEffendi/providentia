Absolutely nothing spectacular about this BBQ. Nothing. Oh except that it's in North Scottsdale with no real competition around it. On top of ok BBQ, the amount of time you wait for your food. Or to even order. No priority here. During the lunch rush you can watch cooks play and laugh back there instead of putting their heads down and rocking out tickets. 4 dollars for frozen potatoes by the way. Not even house made. Cheap Sysco ketchup to go along with it and super runny almost water ranch. I only mention it because of the prices. They purchase the cheapest product possible and try to pass it as something upscale. Now if you're up here and hungry, sure it's a good choice, but don't drive up here to try mediocrity
