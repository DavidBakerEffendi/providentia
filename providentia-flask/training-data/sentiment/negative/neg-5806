Hmmm, where to start. We get to the restaurant and we're seated immediately. I ordered a short rib sandwich and my other 3 friends got pho. When the pho came out, one was incorrect so they let us keep it. We waited 30 minutes for his vegetable pho  and my sandwich which never came out. Once his pho finally came out, there was a huge strand of hair in it. We spoke with the manager Kathy and what she offered us 20% off ($5) our meal. The waiters obviously felt bad and held their head down. The waitress offered something for free to go but Kathy butted in and said no they don't have time. Oh we don't? Okay.

So to conclude, I never got my sandwich, 30 minutes to make vegetable pho, and hair in said pho. Garbage. Save yourself a trip, don't go here.
