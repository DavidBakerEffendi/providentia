Disappointed went to dinner and loved it. Sunday , decided to try brunch. So disappointed watered  down drinks with brunch , so they upsell premium drinks.   The eggs were burned and ruined my brunch selection.  Your only allowed one brunch selection.  Out of all the brunch places in Vegas. This is not one to do.  Over priced and undervalued.  The place was empty for brunch.  That should have been a clue.
