The food is always good. I have been eating at Wahoos all over for 20 years, but the bartender Breanna is rude. She made me feel very uncomfortable. I got my beer the same time I did my taco. I mentioned I was in a hurry and she didn't seem to care. I will never sit at her bar again. This is why I am giving one star. I will be back for the good and not the service.
