Was treated like crap by Viola, she would roll her eyes and question if we were even able to pay! Completely unacceptable. We called earlier and confirmed that they were serving brunch. I record all my calls (work related). When I played the audio and they said it was their casino operator and that its not their fault  I was misinformed. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU WANT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.
