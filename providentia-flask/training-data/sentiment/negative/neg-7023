My wife & I are Scottsdale residents so we've had Mexican food a few ( hundred) times....this was an UNPLEASANT experience.  We had the Carne Asada & Beef Fajitas.   Her Med Rare was charred done.  My fajitas were a salty, oily pile of onions & peppers.   To top it off we gave our Groupon to our waitress & the fun really began....Claudia wrote the voucher # down & tried to redeem it but there was bad reception and it would not show as "Used".  We offered to go outside & try to connect... No luck... Groupon server was down. We went back in and Claudia told us we would have to call Groupon and she couldn't honor the voucher.  We asked to speak to a manager and she was very pleasant and explained that it happened to them three times this evening and as long as the waitress already had the voucher # it would be no problem. The picture is of our unbussed table after we paid our check and went through this 15 minutes of hassle!  Claudia needs additional CUSTOMER SERVICE training!
