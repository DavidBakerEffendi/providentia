Kind of sad pasta fresh has closed but I definitely saw it coming. Once the owner stopped coming in and cooking the food himself, it all went to crap. The last time I ate here Chef Wes the owner was off and the cooks that we're working took no pride in their work, the food was cold and the flavor was way off.
