Had lunch here the other day and was very disappointed. My mom used credit from Total Rewards to pay for our meal and I believe we got taken. 
I got the turkey club and shared with my wife, who got the Cesar salad. My club had dry turkey, barely crisp bacon and tough toast. Not to mention no mustard, mayo or other sauce to lubricate it down. Disappointing.  My wife's salad had the ends of the romaine in the salad. It was dressed well, but lacked any seasoning. Just ok. 
My brother in law found a piece of paper towel in his chicken fried steak. Yuck!
The topper was that my little girls mac and cheese was grainy and an odd orange. She lives on boxed Mac and cheese but this was just un edible. 
Toby, I was embarrassed for you.
