This was our fave pizza place. The monster pizza had so many great toppings. But tonight.... nope nope nope. Called in an order and was told 20 min. Showed up and was told 20 more. Walked back in after that 20 and they hadn't even put it in the oven. Asked for a manager and they said he was putting on sauce on pizza and couldn't come out. Asked for a refund and left. Left a long line of other angry people too. 

This was avoidable - 

1. Call people when their orders are running late
2. Apologize. Just once. You know, like you care about this issue. Give an explanation if you really want my sympathy or my future business. 
3. STOP TAKING MORE PHONE ORDERS UNTIL YOU GET CAUGHT UP. Seriously. 
4. Offer a future coupon or discount on this 60 min (!?) Order. 

Disappointing. But hey, there's always the Gilert location to try!
