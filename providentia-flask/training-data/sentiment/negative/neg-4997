Let's just say you wouldn't eat here for good service. The food can be delicious,well that is if they can actually get an order right. On average, after being seated, it will take 15-20 min for a server to even come introduce their self. Once your order is placed other than when the food/check is brought that will likely be the last time you see them. Hope you bring your own water for the AZ heat because getting a server to come refill you water, without you having to go up to the bar and do it yourself, is a mission impossible. Extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with this restaurant.
