Was very disappointed with this place. I had been wanting to try it out for months and well,  I'm sad I did.  We came for dinner, place looks run down and dirty. Only 1 waitress/hostess who had an attitude and service was VERY slow...mind you, there were only 3 tables sat at, ours included.  My chicken wrap was beyond bland and the fries were terribly undercooked, I would have asked her to send them back but I had earlier witnessed another customer send her burger back and I saw the disgust and frustration on her face, I didn't want to deal with the attitude.  Maybe they are better for breakfast, but I will stick to Southwest diner just down the block!
