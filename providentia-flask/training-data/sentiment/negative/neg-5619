Worst poutine I've ever eaten to be honest - it made me and my friends sick. the gravy seemed like it was packaged powdered gravy and it was lukewarm, fries were undercooked or too dry and salty for the amount of gravy. The gravy wasn't hot enough to melt the curds. You can get better poutine at Swiss chalet even....
