Dropping to a zero star given the aggressive emails I have received since posting my original review.  Pretty much proves my point this is a very judgmental and angry place.  

Also proving my point this is not a healthy option?  The Toronto Star review on caloric, sodium etc intake with one of their top sellers - google it, Yelp doesn't allow hyperlink posts 

Hogtown sucks
