Stopped by Ryu sushi bar for a quick lunch? I ordered gyoza, a shrimp tempura roll and a spicy crab roll.  The gyoza was flavorless and lacked filling. I complained about the seaweed texture and the manager (owner?) stated that I should have ordered some sort of soy product to substitute for the seaweed. The seaweed was tough and chewy.  It seemed to wad up like a piece of chewing gum. I had to spit it out each time I ate a piece of a roll.  I was very disappointed and was not offered a new roll with the so called "soy" product or discount on my sushi.  I won't be returning!  I have never experienced this before at any other sushi place!
