This is just another chicken place in Vegas. Whatever you can think of to add to honey then that's your sauce. I'll stick with Canes or go to one of the new chick fil a. This place is practically empty but none of the tables are clean. All with crumbs or with sandwich toppings. I couldn't even get my ice tea. The guy told me it was just about done brewing and still 20 minutes later still no tea. 

Pick another place to eat.
