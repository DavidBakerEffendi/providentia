First time here. Went with wife and kids. Ordered chicago fries, onion rings, western pizza and taco pizza. Got 7 onion rings, dry micowaved fries and waited 1 hour and 20 minutes for pizza. The western did not have any beef or bacon and very little onion and peppers. The taco pizza had cold sause on the top. I would not go back or refer this place to anyone unless you want expensive cheese pizzas.
