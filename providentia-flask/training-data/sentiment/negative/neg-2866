Banchans are the best part of Korean dining! Unfortunately, it's very limited here. Taste wise, the bbq was fine but pricier than most places. They also have all these restrictions, which kinda defeats the purpose of getting all you can eat. I didn't even enjoy my sundubu. It was like eating tofu in flavored water. Servers are nice but very slow and forgetful. 

Last time I ate here I got a stomach ache and ended up rushing home like a speed racer! I really only come here because it's one of the few AYCE Korean bbq spots that hasn't landed itself on Dirty Dining. Since this place gave me bubble guts, I'd rather pass and take my chances elsewhere.
