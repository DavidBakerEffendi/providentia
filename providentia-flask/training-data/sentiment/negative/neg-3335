I just want to say thank you for denying us service at 6pm when it was completely dead inside your restaurant and telling my guests and I everything was reserved.
We ended up at Roka Akor which seemed like a better environment anyways when we walked in, and the food was incredible.

Here's the ironic part, we went to you first because you had the highest rating on Yelp. Sucks to shoot yourself in the foot, aye? If I could give zero stars for customer service, I would. Good luck :)
