Please do not eat here, eat anywhere else but here.  I ordered the stir fry chili chicken udon noodles and it was cooked so poorly.  It wasn't even cooked properly, undercooked, temperature was barely even warm.  I didn't notice the issue until I had got back to my office and not worth another 15 minutes to go back and get it done right.  I was the only customer there so there wasn't a rush to rush to cook my order so this was a clear case of the cook simply not caring enough and just to expedite his work.  The taste itself is bad, the sauce they cook the noodles in was sooooo sweet it tasted like it was sweet soup noodles.

This place is easily one of the worst in the food court here.  A colleague of mine informed me awhile back she had found a maggot in her food.  That should have been my red flag but human nature always lean to give second chances, but not thirds.
