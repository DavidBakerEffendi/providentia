I love Denny's but after eating here I think I have to stay away from Denny's from a while. The service was terrible and there's no nice way to put it. We were given a bad attitude as soon as we walked in the door....way to set the mood!  I was mostly displeased with the female security guard for being so rude and off. I don't know maybe the terrible service is due to the fact that we visited this place late night...but  that is no excuse to treat customers so horribly.
