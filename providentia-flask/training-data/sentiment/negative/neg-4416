We were in Las Vegas for a trade show and friends wanted to eat at the Buffet. Most buffets in Vegas are a safe bet. This one - not so much. The crab legs are very good and if that's all you want to eat, stick with them. This is the only place I've ever been where the kobe beef was dry and rubbery. The sushi is made at the buffet but it's quality is sub-par. The dessert bar was awful. I really don't have much that's good to say about this buffet. For $50 a person, there are better options for a buffet. Go to Caesear's Palace buffet - it's really, really good. The buffet at Paris Paris was delicious - let me temper that statement by adding that I haven't eaten at this buffet in several years - it might have changed.

It is very surprising that the buffet is so poor. For the money, go to the Cafe - the food is much better.
