Waited 25 minutes in line to order our food. It was 4 dollars for 2 pieces of bacon. The food is just alright nothing that stood out to me. I had the slut that came in the smallest mason jar ever with potato pur√©e at the bottom and a coddled egg on top with 3 pieces of crostini for 10 dollars...... obviously that doesn't fill you up. It was more of a snack breakfast place. My boyfriend had and egg sandwich which he wasn't impressed with either. $5 dollars for orange juice is absolutely ridiculous. And for a $30 dollar meal you should at least feel satisfied after. I'm genuinely surprised most people love it so much... it's honestly nothing I couldn't make at home. Maybe I'm just spoiled with the food that I work with at my job but I was definitely not impressed what so ever. There was no sides besides salad... for breakfast?? No thanks. I will definitely not be back for a 25 minute wait and $30 dollar snack
