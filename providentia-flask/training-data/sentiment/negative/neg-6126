I DONT love this bar and grill. The atmosphere is very impersonal. They call parties that are waiting to be seated over a microphone like you are at a car dealership. So once you are seated, you keep getting jolted by the loud "party of 4!" Screams. 
The service was very slow. We were seated before another couple yet, somehow their food arrived before us and they had steak and we didn't. The food was decent, not bad, definitely not worth waiting for and nothing to rave about. Not worth the price of the food or the wait. There are so many other options in vegas to choose from. 
Also, as a side note, my aunt has been to the other TLBG location and said what a disappointment this one is compared to the great food and service at one in California.
