This is probably the worst sports bar I have ever encountered in Las Vegas, which is saying a lot. I can't comment on the food, unfortunately, since the hostess decided to completely disregard my reservation and give me serious attitude. Long story short, I made a reservation requesting a view of the Golden Knights playoff game...in Vegas...I was lied to online and on the phone. The hostess put us in a corner, no view of the TV, and told me my only option was sitting there or leaving. Look, you don't want my business, that's fine...just don't lie to me on the phone or waste my time. Tom's Urban sucks, especially the hostess.
