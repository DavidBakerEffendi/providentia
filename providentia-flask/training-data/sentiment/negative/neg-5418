Never again. I should've known better when my to go order came out within 2 minutes. The shrimp tasted like it was fried three days ago and then warmed up in the microwave. Dry, old noodles. I basically threw my money down the toilet because this dinner was tossed in the trash after literally three bites. Superior Pho has no competition. 
Just..don't.
