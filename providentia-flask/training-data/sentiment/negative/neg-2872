I go here when I'm desperate for a quick Vietnamese sandwich.

I don't know what happened but when that place changed management and painted the restaurant it has the most horrible stench in there.

I can't tell if it's cigarette smoke, and at first I thought it was just lingering from a smoker but it's been months and the past 4 times I've been there, it smells horrible.

Unless you don't care about smell when you eat (which I'm pretty sure I'd rather smell roses than cigarettes when I eat) then eat here. But if you care, then find a new place and tell me about it.

I honestly had to wait outside while I waited for my sandwich.

Harsh? Yikes. Sorry. It's the truth

(I hope some worker there sees this and fixes this problem. Yes, I have mentioned it to them before but I don't know how helpful it was)
