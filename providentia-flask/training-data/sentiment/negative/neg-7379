I love their mango drinks. They are really made with real mangoes. They are sweet and delicious. But I don't like the way that I am informed after I have placed my order that there's about 20 minutes wait for my  drink. If I knew that it would take that long to wait for my drink , I would have moved to another restaurant. 

In addition, different waitresses came several times to take the complete order at my table. The regular size of a drink is not much a difference from the large size, and the large size is not much a difference from a jumbo size. The $1 additional charge to upgrade for a bigger size is a bit speechless  to me. $$$$$
