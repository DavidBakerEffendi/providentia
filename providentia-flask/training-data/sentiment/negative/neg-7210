I am a vegetarian and the options are not great for me here. I know the burgers can be 'switched' to a veggie patty, and there are salads, but the menu is not vegetarian friendly...So I ordered the potato barrels to begin with, being careful to let the server know to make a note to not add bacon bits. That is all I ordered, because it arrived burnt and really, really greasy looking- not appetizing to look at or eat. So, I lost my appetite for anything else. My negative experience also had a lot to do with the server. I did not feel as if he cared too much about customer service, he did not ask me if I would like to order anything else, and when I asked for my bill he gave me attitude. I usually tip when I go anywhere, and I left one when I felt he did not deserve it, but it was not the normal amount I would tip someone in a service oriented industry. If you like Pickle Barrel, but prefer good customer service (and food that's not over-cooked) with your meal, then do yourself a favor and go to the Yonge Street location. The location at Yorkdale has an unnecessary pretentious atmosphere, but maybe that was just the server that particular day. Burnt food should never be served in a restaurant, especially a chain that should provide consistency at all of their locations. I will not be visiting there again. Moxy's is around the corner. Better atmosphere, friendlier staff, and more variety of great foods (with vegetarian options). There are many other places in and around Yorkdale that provide great food and service in a nicer environment.
