Do not stop in here. I have absolutely no idea how this location is still open. Went in on Saturday night after work. About 730 pm. My boyfriend and I each ordered a beer, waitress brought that and came back to take our order, and had to come back three times because everything we ordered they were out of. No soup, no tacos, no flatbread, no French dip. All on a Saturday night. Service was mediocre at best. No manager came out to apologize for the inconvenience of having no food to serve with the exception of fried food. Our bill was outrageous and my boyfriend was joking with the waitress and said this is too much and she came back very snappy and rude and was like too bad. We will never go back and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
