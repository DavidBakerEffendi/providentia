LARGE GROUPS BEWARE! - It's not worth the attitude, manipulation, and lack of hospitality. 

DO NOT sign any agreement they put in front of you for a $110.00 Prifixe menu for each guest, that includes a four course meal, with no alcohol.  My suggestion is that you request to MODIFY the agreement, and add in that guest can order off the regular menu at regular prices!!! Don't let them say otherwise, because  ALL agreements can be modified. If they complain, than there is your first sign that they will be unaccommodating to you and your guest, and you should take your business elsewhere. We had (14) people, which they sat us down in the main room with everyone else, as the walk-ins & reservations. Nothing is wrong with that, but when they tell you that you can not order off the regular menu, it's not fair. After fighting them because one guest wanted to order at $28.00 hamburger, they came back and said, that they can do that,  but they would still have to pay $110.00 for the hamburger. The whole thing got blown out of proportion, and they finally settled.  I would understand if they gave us a private room, but when you are sitting next to a couple that just walked in, and they can freely order what they want at regular prices, you should be able to do the same thing. Besides, they give you too much food, which no one was able to finish, some food was untouched, even for extra large people.  

It's sad that the N9NE Group was not looking at the bigger picture. Many businesses would have been more grateful, and treated our group of (14) a lot better. Our bill quickly added up to $2,500.00, which came out more because of our alcohol purchase.  An now none of us are ever going to return there, nor say good things about them to our friends, nor our social friends on social sites (Yelp, Facebook, etc).

"Poor Management" with large groups - which ruins the whole experience.
