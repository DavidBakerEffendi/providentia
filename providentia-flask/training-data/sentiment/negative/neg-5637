Another reviewer (Kish M.) states, "Remember, there's only so much that you can do with eggs, toast, and bacon" - and yet, somehow, this place managed to fuck up every variation my family tried. You have to work at it, really hard, to make Eggs Benedict unpalatable. You have to expend concerted effort to make scrambled eggs so dry and unappealing that even my kid, the scourge of all eggs,  won't eat them. I don't even remember what my wife ordered, but she gave up after two bites, because it was revolting.
