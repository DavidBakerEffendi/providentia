Oh man was this place nasty. I went with a group of friends for a weekday dinner buffet (on a Thursday night). NONE of us found anything that we liked to eat and we left feeling unsatisfied and not even full! A lot of the food tasted over-salted but it was especially noticeable in the crab legs. It was nice that they were pre-cut, but was it really necessary to pour a whole shaker of salt on it?? 

One of my friends unfortunately got food poisoning at the buffet, most likely from the sushi (the only thing he ate that we didn't) which spoiled our evening because he needed to be near a bathroom.

I was VERY upset at their dessert selection. All of the cream/mousses tasted watered down, everything had the wrong texture or taste and there was only one decent dessert. It was this nutella in a cone with some orange on it. But it is pretty hard to go wrong when there's nutella. 

Even though the price was decent for a dinner buffet, with other buffet options available in vegas, Bellagio's dinner buffet is definitely not worth trying.
