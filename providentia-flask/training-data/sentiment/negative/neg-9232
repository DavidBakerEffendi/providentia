--The cashier lady tried to over charge you!!!--

My family wen to this place few times. The last one, on 08/23/2016, was really really bad! 
Food is not tested good like before, small portion, pricey ($58.35 for 3 per.) and slow service.

The worst part is: the cashier lady tried to over charge you!!! Here is the trick: she printed our a credit card receipt with amount $58.35. Then, she stapled another small sticker on top of it with a $7.00 item (no details shown what it is), so the amount became $65.35. If I didn't pay attention, I may paid $58.35 + $7.00 + Tips! I asked her what is that? She quickly took it off and said it was for another customer!  Big liar! Be careful people!
