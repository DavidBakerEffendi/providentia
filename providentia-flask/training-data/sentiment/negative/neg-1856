If I could give this place 0 stars I would! The food is way over priced! Who wants to spend 15$ on eggs and toast? The food was gross, the menu is full of weird ingredients... nothing was good! I will NEVER EVER EVER eat here or recommend anyone to this place. They need to do a major overhaul of the menu - maybe more basic. Gross. Don't waste your time or money- go eat at Mickey d's, dennys, or IHOP ! Seriously
