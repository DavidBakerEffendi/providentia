Ordered the whole wheat vegetarian pizza. Although made promptly - the pizza was garbage. The cut tomato was cubed and whitish. I expect the tomato to be very thinly sliced and ripe. Baking the pizza like that made the entire tomato juice overflow on the pizza and picking up the slice made the entire ingredients fall of the slice. Add to that the pizza thickness in the center was very low which further made it difficult for the ingredients to stick to the pizza. The pizza didn't taste very good and had no salt. Understand that salt can be added later - but for a "gourmet pizza" claim - they need to live up to the expectation. I give them an "F" overall.
