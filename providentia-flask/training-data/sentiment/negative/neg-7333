Went for dinner ordered a three entrée with one side and a two entrée one side.dined in. Alexis was the server. Alexis screwed up on the three entrée one side plate, by adding food and take food off the plate that was not even part of the order and continued to dump the food back into the line in front of customers. She also used the same containers. She was rude and had attitude with me because I corrected what the plate was supposed to have on it. she did not offer sauces nor drinks and gave attitude when we asked who the manager was because our order had to be corrected three times and still was wrong. The manager after hearing what just happened replied with Alexis is untrained and unexperienced with the restaurant. While eating our dinner we noticed Alexis snapping photos of herself  instead of cleaning up the restaurant. The floors,walls,tables, chairs, condiments all sticky and trash was overfilling on the floor. Instead of getting trained Alexis played around got herself a drink went to the bathroom, didn't wash her hands and served another customer. This is unbelievable and unprofessional will not be returning also plan out disgusting.
