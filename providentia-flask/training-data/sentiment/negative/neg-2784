I can't figure out HOW we made such a mistake with this place, with such good reviews. First, it was expensive ($30 for takeout- a sesame chicken, a schezuan chicken, and fried rice... I was expecting a tab closer to $21-25 with tax.) 

When we got our takeout home, we were hopeful. All of my fellow Yelper's reviews were so glowing. Now I'm convinced that every person who rated it with 5 stars was paid to do so or came just for the tea and fortune cookies- but I'm not sure as we didn't eat in. 

Our food was inedible. I'm serious- and usually once I've shelled out a few bucks for something I'll at least hunker down and eat it, but instead I'd rather go hungry tonight. And my husband will eat ANYTHING, so for him not to touch his dish is pretty reassuring to me that I'm not just some crazy snob who doesn't like the food (and Chinese is never a bad choice for me, I've never given up.) The sesame chicken tasted like soggy chicken nuggets. Bland and mushy. The schezuan chicken clearly was made up of canned chicken. Tiny nondescript bits of white meat that seemed extremely processed (not fresh at all), and in some sort of spicy-ketchup sauce. The fried rice was the only thing I would consider worth eating, but was full of the same canned-chicken processed crap. I'm serious, you could almost confuse the meat here for "Chicken of the Sea." Same preserved flavor, and that's not the MSG talking.

Maybe we ordered the wrong things, I don't know, but we literally took about 3 bites each and stared in remorse at our inedible dinner, as we contemplated calling for a refund or going out for a frozen pizza. 

Never again will I eat here. They were SO nice- SO nice. That's about the only remarkable thing about this place. Unlike other Yelpers, I would try ANY other place in the valley before returning for more of the same here.
