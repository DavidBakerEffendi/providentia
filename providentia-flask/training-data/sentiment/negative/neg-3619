I only went here cause it was the closest French restaurant where I was staying, as it was a walking distance to here. The menu had a wide variety of entrees to choose from. It almost seemed like I was in a Denny's or Norm's diner. The food was average. What turned me off mostly was the fact that my waitress was taking advantage of me with the bill. I had brought Canadian money in advance for my trip. The waitress said that on the bill I should add a tip, as she lectured me that other restaurants will take advantage of me if I don't look at the bill carefully. The bill had already added the tax and tip and yet she said it didn't. I do not recommend anyone to go here whatsoever.
