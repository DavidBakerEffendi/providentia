It would be awesome if you were actually open when your website says you are. We purchased a certificate through Creative Loafing deals. Never heard of the restaurant but thought the description sounded great and there were actually a few good reviews on Yelp and Urbanspoon. Drove to your restaurant on a Thursday evening for dinner. Guess what? Closed. No sign on the door. No answer on the phone. No recorded message. Sounds like a scam or if you've changed your hours, you should update your website and display signage at the restaurant.
