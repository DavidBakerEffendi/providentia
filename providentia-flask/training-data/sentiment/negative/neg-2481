My husband and I just moved here due to him being stationed at Luke AFB. Roadhouse is a big deal and an amazing restaurant back in our hometown in Ohio, so we thought we'd check it out here. The first time we went, his medium steak came out rare and fatty, and my medium well was complete charcoal. The cheese fries were cold and they put cold shredded cheese over top (usually supposed to be melted over the fries??). They offered a free onion for next time. Second time we went, the server took over 10 minutes for our drinks, we waited almost a half hour for our salads (which came out with our steaks?), and the medium well steak came out bloody. After having to sit for awhile because our server never checked on us, I sent it back to cook a little longer, and it came out with no mushrooms or onions that I previously ordered. Then when we requested the check, we asked if military discount was offered. Our server told us no because we had a free app from our previous visit. This place can't cook steaks properly and the service sucked both times. Sadly, we will not be returning to a restaurant we have always loved.
