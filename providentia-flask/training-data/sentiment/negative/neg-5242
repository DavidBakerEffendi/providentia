Here's my cliche "I would give them 0 stars if I could" review lol:

Me and my family came here and didn't wait long at all before being seated, BUT then it took a while before they came around to take our order. From here on everything just went downhill. The guy who took our order was straight up rude. I asked if the steamed chicken could be made spicy due to a misinterpretation on my part of the menu. He literally could've just said "sorry, we don't cook it that way" but instead he gave me a dirty look and belittled me for even asking. I know that at more traditional Asian restaurants the bar is low for customer service but this was just on another level. Then he began to walk away before we even finished taking our order!

We literally asked for waters 3 times only to either forgotten or ignored. My mom eventually had to get up and get the cups and water pitcher herself from the kitchen because no one was even looking at us when we were trying to get their attention. I rarely write reviews on Yelp, but the way they treated me just left me beyond annoyed.

The food was mediocre at best. Everything was bland, we had to add a good amount of salt and pepper to even get some taste. So save your time and money and hit up literally ANYWHERE else because it will be better than this shithole.
