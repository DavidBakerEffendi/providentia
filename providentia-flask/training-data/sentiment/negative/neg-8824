What service? Showed up to an empty restaurant; considered raiding the bar until the owner surfaced 5-10 minutes later. He made us go back into the kitchen to give our order directly to the chef - isn't this what a server is for? The chicken parm was like eating a shoe, seriously dog food. Awful experience.
