We ate here on Thursday and experienced the worst service I have ever had.  When we arrived we were the only table in the restaurant.  It took over 20 mins for someone to take our order.  When food came out over 40 mins later it came out separate.  By the time one of the meals came two others were already done and this dish was a bean and cheese burrito.   Then when it was time for our bill I had to search for our server only to find two servers hanging out at a table in the back room watching tv.  Awful experience and will never go back.
