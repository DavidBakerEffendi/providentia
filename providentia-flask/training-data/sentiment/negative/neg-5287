Called in an order for delivery, had to speak to 3 different people in order to find someone who could take my order. When I tried to order wings, they had no idea what I was talking about. Finally placed a fairly large order for 48 breaded wings and 2 large pizzas. The order took over 1.5 hours to be delivered. We called the store twice and were told the driver would be at our house "any minute". 

We ended up paying $68 for our $85 order upon recognizing the fact the food took a very long time, and that they gave us the incorrect dipping sauces. 

The driver left and we opened the wings and then realized that they weren't breaded... the menu clearly states that the wings are breaded. 

Overall, pizza was mediocre, wings were gross. Service and delivery complete failure. 

I will never order from here again.
