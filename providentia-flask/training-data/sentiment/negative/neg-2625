First I ordered two drinks, and the man behind me ordered something more difficult than mine to make.  After waiting for seven minutes, I came back to discover that the barista finished his drink and hadn't even started on mine. She made mine finally, at this point I had waited over 15 minutes. I ordered a sweet drink, and it seriously was the most bitter drink I had ever had at any coffee shop. I don't even know what she made. The espresso tasted weird... So I asked her to remake it because there was no way I could drink any of it. This time I waited another 10 minutes for my drink, and I saw that she had used milk instead of almond milk like I requested. I'm allergic to milk. At this point it had been about 30 minutes since I ordered the first time and I was getting pretty damn frustrated. I asked once more if she could just remake them. I also requested a refund because of how long we were waiting. She finally finished my drinks about 45 minutes later. Get this. The manager or team lead guy came out and asked if everything was okay. We told him what happened, how it took 45 minutes to make a drink. (They weren't even busy, it was 11:30pm) and it took three times to get it right. He asked us if the drinks were fine now, and that if they were there was no refund needed. TERRIBLE customer service. Needless to say, we aren't coming back here. I don't recommend it. Go to Jobot instead.
