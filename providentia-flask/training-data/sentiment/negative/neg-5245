I ordered the half sandwich and soup combo....so far so good.  She took what I thought was a half-sandwich and cut that in half!!!!   Oh boy, very small.  I attached a picturet.   Anyways, the soup was broccoli and cheese. That was pretty good.  Total was 8 bucks.  I'm not going back, I dont see what the hype is at this place besides it being at the airport.
