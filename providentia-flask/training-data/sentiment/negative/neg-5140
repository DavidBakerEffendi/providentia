I tried to order a California burrito with chicken. They tell me they are out of chicken. I said fine ill take a regular California burrito. 10 minutes later and a drive home all I have is a plain chicken burrito I tried calling twice they don't answer the phone - I'm very sad I really wanted cheese pico and fries in my burrito
