I went to the buffet around 8:30pm on a Saturday. I could not have been more disappointed. For starters, I was excited they offer caviar since it is not an item I get to eat often. I tried the American black caviar which had very fishy taste and not in a good way. I have  tried caviar at the Ritz Carlton buffet on multiple occasions and what was provided at the Bellagio paled in comparison. Okay, let's move on to some nigiri. The sushi rice was horrid. It's temperature inferred that it had been stored in a refrigerator for quite awhile. The rice had a very gummy texture which indicated that it had been overworked in its preparation. The actual fish was average quality but in combination with the rice, made it miserable to eat.  Maybe the crayfish will be better. Nope. Other than being some of the smallest mud bugs I have seen, they had absolutely no seasoning.  Good thing the salmon cooked on the griddle??? was over cooked.....oh.....wait a sec. The Beef Wellington was cooked past medium well making the dish very dry. I also have never heard of pork Oso Bucco which was on the buffet as well. My recommendation to the chef, stick with beef!!!! A question, is any senior chef at the bellagio tasting these dishes?? The paella was a soggy mess. In fairness, the lamb was fine even though it was labeled as leg of lamb yet had rib bones attached. hmmmmmm.  At this point I gave up trying different items and left very disappointed.
