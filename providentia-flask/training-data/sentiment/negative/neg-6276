THE WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN, AND I'VE BEEN TO SOME BAD ONES. The food is mediocre and the waiters suck. The food takes forever and then comes out barely warm and wrong. 
I get the idea behind the place harmless banter all good and well until the server starts calling people bitches and flipping them off. Simple banter is all in fun but what's too far? The place is an over prized joke.
