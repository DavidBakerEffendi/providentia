Wanted something extra special for our daughter's 3rd birthday party. Went into the store to ask about a custom order and the woman behind the counter acted like I was bothering her. Was willing to spend good money, we got our girl a pony for her friends to ride on for crying out loud, but this woman was so off putting. Took my business elsewhere.

I remembered this place being so friendly and having beautiful cakes on the walls. Not the place it once was.
