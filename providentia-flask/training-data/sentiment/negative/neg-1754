quick review of my dim sum experience at this establishment:
Food: 1/5 - I found all the fried food to be too greasy, taro cake tasted like chalk, the cold melon soup tasted like they used un-ripe cantaloupe
Service: 3/5 - the servers pushing the carts were friendly but the lady who took our bill was a bit of a witch
Ambiance: 2/5 - washrooms are disgusting, they need to clean the aquarium at the front where they keep the lobsters
Price: 1/5 - overpriced based on the poor quality of the food

...not coming back here anytime soon.
