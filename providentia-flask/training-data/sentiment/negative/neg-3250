Returned again after a long wait. Sat at the bar just to be ignored by the bartender. Gerry i think his name was. Sat there over 20 minutes before ordering a beer, finally got the beer 10 minutes after that. Maybe 6 people sitting at the bar. It was a tuesday night for christs sake. Not busy at all. Worst service ever. Will remember to drive an extra 20 minutes to go to gilbert. They know good service. Pathetic.
