Do not eat here. The manager will drop steak on the floor then pick it back up and use it. I mean a whole bucket of steak not just one piece!! If you like food made by dirty hands this is the place for you. They will eat, smoke, and touch raw meat without washing there hands once. I've watched the general manager touch the phone with a gloved hand then go right back to your sandwiches!! BEWARE the disgusting practices at this store!!
