I wanted to try this place and I decided to ignore the reviews. Well let's just say I'm an idiot and I should of believed in them. 
I wanted sushi mainly and I looked on the Internet to see what their buffet consisted of...no info... The sushi display was I believe 4 pieces of California roll and that was it for our entire 1hr visit. 
They had the usual Chinese offerings and the food was okay. The offerings were very minimal so don't come thinking it's your typical large buffet. 
The price I guess is reflective of the limited items, $9.75
Please take my review advice and spend your money elsewhere. At the moment my stomach is churning and I'm hoping I don't get sick tonight.
