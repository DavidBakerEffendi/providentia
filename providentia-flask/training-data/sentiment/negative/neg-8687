Three of us went to Landry's for an early dinner upon arrival to Vegas.  The waitress, Denise was great and if we could rate her, she would get 5 stars. One of us had the Southern Fried Fish and the other two ladies had the Tilapia dish.  Needless to say within about 45 minutes we were all sick.  We called the restaurant and told them what happened.  The response by the General Manager was he had to see if other people were going to call and complain and that maybe something else we ate made us sick.  We will not go to this restaurant again and I'd advise other's to think twice about eating here.
