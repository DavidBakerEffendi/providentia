These employees need training on allergen precaution. Every single time-every SINGLE time-the allergen is placed on my food at this location. I don't often eat McDonald's, but this is the closest fast food establishment to my home, and occasionally a dollar menu item is easiest if ALLERGENS are left off of the order when specifically instructed! I don't understand how little regard for dietary hazards these employees can have. It's disheartening, and yet it happens with every order. Never again.
