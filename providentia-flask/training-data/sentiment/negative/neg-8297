Good Filipino (Cebu provincial cuisine) comfort food stunted by poor service from the wait staff. Last time I checked, water was a free refill, but my wife and I didn't get offered refills. Also, I had to get up and find another server to request dessert. (I wanted to skip dessert altogether, but my seven-year old was craving halo-halo.)

To be fair, there was a large 30-cover party occurring the next several tables over, so I guess it was OK to ignore the other patrons in the restaurant. NOT!
