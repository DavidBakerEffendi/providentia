I've been at least 6 times in past 2 weeks. Drive through wait is extremely long. Food is always prepared differently (one day the flat bread is good the next day it's not) it's never consistent. I understand they're new but it's not a good way to start the business. I usually love this place but the more I go to this one the less I like it. They need to step it up, before they have one less costumer.
