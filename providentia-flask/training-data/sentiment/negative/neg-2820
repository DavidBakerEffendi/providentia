From take out box right to the trash can. I've had Persian, Arminian, Turkish beef Kabob before & I know my middle eastern food, but this thing was absolutely disguising! The minced beef (koobideh) was dry, not hot & very herbal. The rice stank so bad I didn't even touch it. I wonder how they managed to screw white rice like that. I don't even recommend this place to my enemies!
