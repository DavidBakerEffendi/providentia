Wasn't able to eat here. The place was empty, maybe 3-4 full tables. We went as a group of five, from jury. Our waitress refused to write separate tickets because they were expecting to get busy later. I would understand in a packed house. We asked if we should go somewhere else or if they wanted our business, she then walked away from our table without saying a word. On the way out the door she had the audacity to thank us for coming and welcome us back next time. Will never go back. This place was the worst customer service I've seen. Would recommend Squid Ink on service alone, over this place. Try Squid Ink's surf and turf roll, amazing.
