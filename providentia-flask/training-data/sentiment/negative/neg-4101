My wife and I live in Anthem.  We went here cause it is close to us. Ordered some take out from here last night.  $52 worth of the worst fish my wife and I have ever had. We took a couple bites and threw the rest in the garbage.  I don't know if they thought we wouldn't notice but I can tell you that is the last time we will ever go back.  I suspect this place will be out of business soon. 

I give one star cause can't give less
