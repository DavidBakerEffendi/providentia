Possible good food but very poor service.  Just because your busy doesn't mean the cash register operator can be rude.  Came with my family. Got s screwed up burger order.  Waited for nearly and hour for them to fix my burger order and when I finally got it , I got it with an attitude. So I asked for my money back and left.  Many places serve great burgers and it's ok to screw up not ok to screw up and give me an attitude
