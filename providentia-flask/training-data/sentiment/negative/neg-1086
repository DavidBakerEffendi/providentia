This restaurant has so much potential! Maybe we just had a bad server but my experience here left no desire to ever return. When a customer orders their food a particular way, you don't then serve it completely different with the excuse of I think you'll like it better my way. Because of this server...the best part of my meal was the steamed baby carrots...and I paid much more than I should have to enjoy baby carrots.
