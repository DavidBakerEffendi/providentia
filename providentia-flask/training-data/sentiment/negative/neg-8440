We visited for the second time this morning and left a few minutes after being seated. My family went for my birthday to have brunch. I had decided a week ago, during our first visit, that I wanted to come back to try the brunch menu, which was very appealing. 

Our first visit was mediocre. I liked the atmosphere and the patio. The food was 'good' but pretty pricey. On our first visit, we were told that they had changed the happy hour menu and no longer served the items published in the menu and online. This was disappointing. We decided it wouldn't be our new neighborhood spot as we hoped it could be. 

Our visit today was even more disappointing. After being seated at a nice little couch/booth on the patio around 10:30am (on Sunday) a server came to greet us. She informed us that they were currently not serving the brunch menu "for a while"... meaning indefinitely, I guess.. We left. Fortunately, O.H.S.O. across the street offers a very nice brunch menu and provided us with the celebratory meal we were looking for. 

This place obviously cannot deliver what it promises.
