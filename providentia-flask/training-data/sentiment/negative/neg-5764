There should be  a law about charging an arm and a leg for airport food when there is no place else to eat. The food has been completely unacceptable, when I am paying 14 dollars for a salad, I expect that the greens are not completely rotted. 

Customer service is completely non-existent.  I attempted to get a fresh cup of coffee made for my frail grandfather when the ladies behind the counter argued with me for twenty minutes that It was fresh and hot. I proceeded to put my fingers in the coffee to demonstrate that it was cold. 

I am not looking for world class service, and amazing food, but some caring about the customers would be a bonus. Surely there are better options for a bite to eat in this airport. I suggest that you look elsewhere
