Hello,

My message unreplied from last night on their message us tab here on yelp:

Really wanted steak tonight and since you're only steakhouse here we popped in.  Great service, steak great but the sides were all hideous: liquid smoke green beans, mashed potatoes (daughter who loves mashed wouldn't eat them and said tasted like sugar in them), freezer burnt broccoli/carrots and over cooked nasty sauces mushrooms.

Thanks,
Eric
