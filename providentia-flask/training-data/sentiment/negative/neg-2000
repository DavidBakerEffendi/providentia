Ok, I am not expecting much from airport food, but sorry, this is hardly edible.  It was so salty and greasy.  I usually don't order Asian food when at the airport, but I was craving rice some kind of bad, so I decided to go for it.  I took two bites and just couldn't eat it anymore.... Super expensive for really bad food.
