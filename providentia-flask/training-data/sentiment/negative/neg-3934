I have been in this spot lots of times and started out having a great time, but lately it has been tense and not that great. Friday was the final straw. I never enjoy watching someone in charge yell at an employee. I sat at the bar and watched the bartender/manager tell the poor servers that she was refusing to make their drinks because they were stealing her glasses. It was ridiculous. I come to have fun, not be made uncomfortable at someone else's expense. I hope this bar has not run its course because it has potential.
