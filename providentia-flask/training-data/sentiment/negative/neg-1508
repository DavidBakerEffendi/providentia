Forced into this place again!  Nothing here has change, in fact it is worse than I remember.  I  feel that places like this that focus on being trendy are really very sad and this place hits that nail on the head. Being trendy takes effort and usually takes away from the quality potential and therefore being good comes second.  To be really good comes naturally with no effort. Here they put a lot of effort into being trendy and as a result the place is crap. They have T.V.s... do i have to say any more.  When you need a distraction from the food like a t.v., you know you are in trouble.
