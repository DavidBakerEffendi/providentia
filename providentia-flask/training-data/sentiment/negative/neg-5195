7 of us had a business lunch at the Mixx on 12/14/17. There was almost nobody there when we walked in. We ordered appetizers. I reached for my plate and noticed it was dirty - it had melted cheese on top of it. I gave it back to the server and while she was standing right next to me, I reached for another plate. This one had chewing gum stuck to it. I was pretty much done - are you kidding me??
We ordered fish and chips but there was only enough fish for 2 people. Then they ran out of fish. I ordered mushroom risotto but was told that they were out of it. It was 12:30pm! Who stocks your kitchen? Two of my co-workers ordered the same pasta meal. One meal had mushrooms in it, the other one did not. No consistency. Needless to say, we will NOT be back.
