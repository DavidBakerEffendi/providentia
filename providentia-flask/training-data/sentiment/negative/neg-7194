Just spent 20 minutes waiting when there was only two cars at the drive thru. Ordered 2 Sinaloa hot dogs with no mustard and 2 chihuahua hot dogs with no guacamole. Apparently that was to difficult of a order. They even added a extra ingredient, Hair on one of the hot dogs. Last time I ever come here
