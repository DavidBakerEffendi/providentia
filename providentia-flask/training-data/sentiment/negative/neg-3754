This place was awful. We got there about 30 minutes after opening and no one else was in there. We still had to wait 20 minutes for drinks. He brought my drink and said I hope you like black licorice, most people don't like this drink. (Would have been nice to know before I ordered.) it was not good. My replacement drink was excellent. We had truffle fries and they were very good. Despite no one being there the grill was dirty from a meal they made for staff. It was clean when we arrived. The counters around the grill were not the cleanest. He proceeded to clean the grill despite our food being right underneath it. I asked him TWICE to please not get any of the grill debris in our food when he was cleaning it. Nope didn't stop him. Then he showed me food garbage all over it like it wasn't that bad. I was prepared a fresh bowl. My friend had chicken and I had seafood. He cooked them with the same utensils. The food was typical Mongolian type grill food. Tasty but not really worth the price tag.  We will never go there again. Very disappointed. We really had high hopes.
