Not sure if any one can guess the picture attached is actually not plain rice but 'vegetable biryani'. Ordered online and got one of the worst biryanis I have ever had. The rice was bad, veggies hidden deep below rice was way over cooked and tasted bad. Restaurant had no courtesy to pack plastic ware and napkins for a delivery order that too when they know their consumer base is largely travelers and not locals. 
Overall - waste of money. At least the dish I ordered.
