Giving it 1 stars because the service we received that day was atrocious, otherwise the bingsoo probably deserved 3 stars.

My friend and I came about an hour before closing and were promptly seated. I've head this place bookmarked and was excited that I finally get to try this place, as the Cups nearby is closed down. However, I was left super disappointed. 

The waitress gave us the menu when we sat down and did not bring us any water. We basically have to press the button on the table to flag down a server as the place seemed really understaffed. We each ordered a bingsoo (Strawberry Bingsoo and Oreo Green Tea Bingsoo) and had to wait 20mins for it, while they still didn't bring us any water, which is already a big red flag for crappy service. 

Then when the waitress brought my friend's bingsoo over first, she was so clumsy she poured it all over the table. But then again she apologized so we were still trying to be patient. However, it took the waitress a good 10mins to come back to wipe the table and clean up the mess to the point that the bingsoo on the table had already melted into a puddle. When my bingsoo finally came I was informed that it did not come with a waffle at the top because they sold out for the day...Well, I would like to be informed of that before my food was served so I could change my order. And then when I came to pay they charged me full price for the bingsoo even though it was missing a key ingredient that was featured in the picture of the item! 

Yeah I'm definitely not coming back here and will not recommend it to anybody.
