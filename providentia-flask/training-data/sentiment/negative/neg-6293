Horrible food and service here on Sunday while going to the rodeo. Had to wait 20 minutes for a table because the kitchen needed to catch up when there were tons of tables available. We get seated and ordered our food. The spinach dip comes out with 12 chips on a huge platter for six people. We go to take a bite of the wings and the they are bone cold. The waitress also brought the wrong food for one of our friends. The waitress took the wings back and they came back on the same plate with the spilled ranch. I was scared to eat them. We also waited 15 minutes to get our drinks the bloody Mary's had been sitting so long the vodka had separated from the mix and the sprite was flat and had no syrup. 
Headed to Buffalo Wild Wings next time.
