Went for Christmas Eve dinner. Made the reservation 1 month earlier. I called and confirmed. Upon arival hostesses seemed confused when I stated my name. At first they told me thay my 2 friends were already waiting.. I replied I did not know them. They then stuck us on the bar area. Waitress was nice. Ordered chicken santa fe with wild rice. Order took more than 30min. When asked why it was taking so long waitress stated that diners get served faster as they made reservations. I informed her I did too. She seemed shocked and checked on the food. Food came out.. chicken dry ..but edible.. hubbys veggies were raw and my wild rice was hard as a rock. I asked for a bake potato intead. Waitress came out apologetic explaining they ran out. Got the mashed potatoes.. pretty good. Dessert. We ordered 4 apple pies .. hubby ordred cheese cake..his came out 10 -15min later. Waitress was helpful though. 
Will never go back. Overpriced.. normally a mgr would come out for this stuff.. not 1 in sight.
