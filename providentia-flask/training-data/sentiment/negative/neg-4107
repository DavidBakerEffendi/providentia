Decided to try this place after we saw the sweet Nelly Belly food truck at Edgewater a few weeks ago. 

I ordered carry out from the restaurant to avoid waiting in line to order...but picking up an order and placing one are done in the same line.

My steak and shroom belly had so much potential based on the description on the menu. Unfortunately a few key things were missing (goat cheese and cream sauce) and it was very burnt, I know it's a wood fired dough, but this was burnt and so were the sweet potato fries. My boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger and fries both if which were low quality like you would get in a school cafeteria.

For $22 you'd think that it would just be better. Really disappointed.
