Rude mouthy manager taking orders and refusing to give food useless I give him a tip and can't get a simple order current.... 1st,  off this dude should a manager if he can't even have proper customers service. 2nd, sense when does Burger King ask there customers for tips let alone with hold a customer food after already paying for and demanding a tip not only once but twice cause I was only given half my food. Seriously this dude needs to be fired...
