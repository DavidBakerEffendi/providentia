1 star is way too overrated for this place! Don't ever go there! We been literally wait outside of the restaurant for 10+ mins with no one greeting us or give us a head up. they overcharge you 15 bucks for a not even authentic Chinese noodles. The food is far from making you full. And the waitress didn't even talk to us when she waits our table. We are from Sichuan province china. We feel ashamed that this restaurant brand their noodles in name of our hometown and with such horrible customers service. I apologize as a Chinese for how they treated our friends from all over the world in Vegas! 
千万不要去，这家店服务很差，价格高，分量非常少，服务员懒得跟你说一句话，建议不给小费，因为你吃的东西价格已够贵了,开车不远的地方有一家川菜馆，比这里好太多了。after i wrote this review, someone called Wei C messaged me privately and said all bad curse words to me. I'm not sure if he is related to this restaurant but his location is LV. OMG.
