This review is merely for the service as our party of 4 never had the chance to dine in. (2/23/2014)
The grease trap fell after we were seated.
The server told us to leave without apologizing, arranging next reservation, or escorting us out.
On our way out, we passed more than 6 staff, and NONE of them ever greeted us or apologized for the inconvenience.
We felt like it is a big joke which ruined our farewell party!!
The staff certainly fails the standard of good customer service and lacks the sense of risk management.
