WARNING!!! This is by far the worst Mediterranean food I have ever had in my life. I paid $40 for a chicken Swarma sandwich, Kafta sandwich, babaganoush and a fatush salad. Every dish was horrible. I recently moved to the east end from Mississauga and wanted to find a restaurant that could compete with a Mediterranean restaurant i use to go to a lot in the west. My search continues. If someone is reading this review and is ever in Mississauga go to a place called Monforts at Dundas and Hurontario. Also if anyone knows of a good Mediterranean restaurant in the Durham region please let me know of it. And again I warn people not to waste their money at the Mazza restaurant in Ajax!!!
