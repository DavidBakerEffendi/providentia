Really loud music, can't hear anyone at your table, horrible service, and over 1.5 hours to get basic breakfast!!!!  Not to mention watching the manager or whoever he was just stand in the kitchen - I suppose supervising.  If you are that short of help, take off your suit coat, roll up your sleeves and hit the grills.  The only good I can stay is when we FINALLY got our food, apparently the omelets were good.  The coffee was great.
