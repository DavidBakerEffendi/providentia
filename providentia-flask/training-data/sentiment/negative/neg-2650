Terrible. I would like to give  minus 10 Stars. we sat outside on a Saturday night evening., the tables have no salt no  pepper shakers no sweetener for my iced tea but filled with ice and very little iced tea. I ordered the special pork steak it was so salty it was terrible the french fries had no salt at all and were on same plate with gravy of my pork which made  some soggy and yucky. The portions were small
My wife's risotto was like a rock probably weighed 3 lb unedible. We ordered a sausage stuffed pepper appetizer never got it. When we told the server she basically smiled and said oh. Of course we will never go back.
