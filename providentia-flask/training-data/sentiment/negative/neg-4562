Terrible service. The restaurant was packed and there was a 30 minute wait for a table but we found a spot on the bar. We quickly grabbed a high top table after ordering drinks from the bartender. Our server had about 7 tables so he was busy. When he greeted us we asked for menus as we had none. Our food was slow to come out but it was busy so that is understandable. The food was good our only issue was the long time between getting more breadsticks and my boyfriend wanted a soup refill that never came. He also ordered another beer that sat in the window for about 7 minutes before a server finally brought it to us. During this time the bartender only had 1 person at the bar but she didn't think she needed to run any drinks. Also an expo employee was hanging out at the bar but not helping our server who was clearly in the weeds. Also as people left the tables were not bussed until eventually a host came and cleaned them. A manager walked by and saw the mess and did nothing! 

Towards the end of our meal we got our check after trying to pay on the kiosk at the table which had the wrong check on it. If a restaurant wants to have this technology they need to make sure guests can use it. 

The tables around us were also upset at the bad service and were complaining to the manager. His exact words were "sorry for the bad service the server was busy". That is absolutely unacceptable when the manager saw the server was busy earlier and did not help him!

We left without complaining since clearly the manager didn't care. 

Our poor server did the best he could but he was clearly oversat and had no help from his management or other employees.
