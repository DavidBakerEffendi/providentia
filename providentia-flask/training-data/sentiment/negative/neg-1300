DON'T TRUST THIS PLACE!

Their carne asada quesadilla is $2.50 more than their carna asada burrito which they state when asked has the same.amount of meat and is the same tortilla even if it has a little more cheese it's not $2.50 worth. Every taco shop like this I've been two has the two priced exaxtithey same or within a dime of each other. If they are overpricing this what else are they hiding???
