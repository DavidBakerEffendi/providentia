So disappointed in how awful this Vegas "gem" has become. The gangsters who made this town are turning in their graves! 
PARKING - forget it !!
RESERVATIONS - yes you need them but why bother ?? We had reservations for 4 at 8:30 pm and didn't get seated until 9:10 pm. 
HOSTESSES - hope you like to be treated like a first grader. Told the girl our whole party was present and she proceeded to say let me know when your whole party arrives !! What ?? 
FOOD - I'm either a food snob, enjoy my own cooking or know why I don't frequent Olive Garden either. This food is below sub par. Truthfully. We sent 2 of the 4 dinners back. Linguine with canned clam sauce ?? We were told they ran out of whole clams ! And you decided that canned clams were acceptable rather than having us make a different food choice ?? Ok ... What about the steak pizzaole ?? Is the steak suppose to be tough (NO !) and is the marinara sauce suppose to be tasteless ?? NO !!! Send it back !!
CAPPUCCINO - really ?? Powdered cappuccino with whipped cream ?? Who puts whipped cream in cappuccino ??? Probably those first graders I referred to earlier. 

If you want a great authentic Italian meal (yes I'm Italian and yes my son is a chef.. SKIP THIS RESTAURANT !!!!!! Awful
