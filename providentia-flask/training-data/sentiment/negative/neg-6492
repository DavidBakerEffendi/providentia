The Good:
- The entree tasted good.
- The salsa was good.

The Bad:
- Went on a weeknight, should have been no wait, but waited at least 5 minutes before someone even showed up to ask me how many people would be in my party. This is, of course, in addition to someone standing behind the counter and completely ignoring me until somebody else showed up.
- Waited over 10 minutes to get drink orders.
- The chips were stale.
- The food was overpriced.
- The drinks were extremely overpriced.
- I got sick after eating there.

Overall, I'd look elsewhere if you want good Mexican food. Don't waste your time with this place.
