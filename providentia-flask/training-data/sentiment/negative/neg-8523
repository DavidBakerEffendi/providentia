I have been here a few times and I have no clue why I keep going because service is absolutely horrible everytime i go. When I ate there the first time it seems like the waitresses always disappear and never come back. My husband ordered a beer and he never got it. I ordered cheese on fries once they forgot the cheese and when I told them they gave me cold shredded cheese. 
 Tonight my husband and I ordered takeout 30 minutes before getting there I called in the order when my husband got there it wasn't ready and he had to wait an additional 30 minutes....then they made the order for dine in instead of take out. The waitresses disappeared on him a few times. Then the food...gross...nothing had flavor not even my poor piece of salmon...it was juicy but no flavor. My husband ordered wings and he said it just tasted like chicken. 

In all seriousness management needs to evaluate their company cause it's not just this location and whoever this lady is who comments "sorry this happened" on the other reviews needs to stop and reevaluate her life too.
