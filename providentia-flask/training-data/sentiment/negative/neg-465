This review is for the bar service at Happy Hour:

Had the serious displeasure of being waited on by the female bartender (Joanna?). She rarely acknowledged my friend and I, but when she did it was with a very bad attitude. She acted like it was a big inconvenience to wait on people. We would have had several drinks here, but we just couldn't track her down, so we only had two. The appetizers were a big disappointment as well, cold and late. 

Long story short: Happy Hour would be a great idea here if it wasn't for such crap service and bad food. Better to leave this place to the Palace Station crowd who are too cheap to hit the strip.
