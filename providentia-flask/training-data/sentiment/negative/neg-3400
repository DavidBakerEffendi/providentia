Let me get this straight this is fine dinning, look at the photos and you tell me what you think, One of the worst places I have eaten in my 45 years on earth, my wife bagged up her pork chop for the dogs, I don't think the chef has taste buds, wait staff was assume, I don't know how anyone can give them above a two star, if this is farm to table leave it at the farm....wow people....so many 5 stars Â¿???????
