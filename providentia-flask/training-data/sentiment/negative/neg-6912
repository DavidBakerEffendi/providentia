I read many review and was excited to try this place. When I got there they were temporarily closed because they had to go to the bank. I waited though. They took my order and my order came with a pepsi but their machine was down. Instead of offering me something else instead or a discount they just said they were out and couldn't do that. I still was hopeful. I ordered and waited over 30 minutes for my order. While I was waiting another couple came in. The guy at the counter said I will be right with you so they sat down and waited. He never came back to them and so after 20 minutes with out him showing any concern to them, they walked out. I finally got my food and brought it home to my family. The beans were like broth. They were watered down and had no flavor. I could not even put it on my frybread. The green chilly was good. The sampler pack I bought was awful my 13year old said the meet tasted old and weird.
