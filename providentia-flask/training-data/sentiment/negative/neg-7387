So so so bad. 

Stopped in on a whim with the kids and was sat immediately. The servers were way too pushy to get us to order before we had a chance to even read the menu. We ordered drinks and only a few of us got them. Ordered food that was pricey but figured it would be at least somewhat good. NO! NO! Horrid. They forgot to bring my daughters food and she considered herself lucky.
The cups they poured the soda in smelled and tasted of dirty dish water but even after they rush you to order, they don't come to check on you at all until you chase them down. Then they say they will fix it then don't come back. 

I ended up being overcharged for what we got and still charged for the food we didn't get. Then on top of it all, they wrote in a mandatory tip that was was waaaaaaaaaay to much for what it should have been without even noting that it was a tip. Snuck it in as an additional charge. I ended up paying almost $100 for what should only have been a $68.00 tab (including the food that we didn't get).

I wish I would have seen that first.
