My kitchen is out of commission and I wanted good Italian without taking my 2 young kids out to a restaurant.  Decided to check this place out.  Found out they are closing soon (no actual closing date).  Apparently the new min wages and costs have taken a toll on small businesses.  The owner gave me and the lady on front of me the whole story.  I feel for small business and definitely support them.  Due to this the selection remaining was limited.  So only had what was available that can be cooked with a microwave or toaster oven.  Only thing available was a small dish of frozen ricotta cheese cannelloni (4 pieces), a small dish with 4 small meat ball and tomato sauce and a small jar of homemade pasta sauce enough for the cannelloni.  Total price $32!  This is a one person meal.  Not only do I have to defrost all of this and microwave it, this was a meal enough for only one.  And I'm not a big eater.  A little pricey when I can eat at good quality pasta at a restaurant with service and no dishes to wash.  I felt too bad for the owner to put things back on the shelf so tried it out.  The concept is good but the prices are too much to do repeat business.  It's a one time thing at these prices.  I expected to be above grocery prices but below Restaurant prices.  Unfortunately they can't make the concept work.  Food was good overall but not the best and it's priced too much for extra trouble on my end
