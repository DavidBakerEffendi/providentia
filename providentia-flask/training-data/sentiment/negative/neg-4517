I don't think I've ever been so upset for choosing a place that served vegan fast food. I've had good vegan and it's just disappointing that it could be like this. I think I'm even more disappointed that a lot of people like it - when you have to compensate for meat and dairy it doesn't mean that you need to make everything extra oily or salty, because that's all that was going on and it was pretty awful. Not to mention uber unhealthy. People if you're going to have junk food just get a good batch of fries somewhere that does GOOD fries. Animal fat excluded obviously.
