The worst dining experience I have ever had. We thought we would grab a bite at fudruckers on 77th and bell. Since kids eat for 99 cents on Monday with the purchase of a meal. When I placed my order the shift leader or manager Miss Sansone seemed very angry and in a bad mood. She attempted to take my order but messed it up. Then barked at me that she was going to start all over. She banged on the screen and banged things around then she gave me the total, I questioned why I didn't get the kids meal at 99 cents. Well, that was it she flew into a rage and started yelling at me that I needed to read the sign and that it's not her fault that I couldn't read the sign right. The she said she was having a great day until I came in. I was in complete shock. It was like if I didn't like whatever price she wanted to charge me then, though. She even said as much. Then it got worse, I said that I have never been treated so badly by anyone and that all I was trying to do is order. At that point she turned around and shrugged, I said I need your name. So she whipped around and took her name tag off and stuck it 1 inch from my face in a very aggressive manner.  Then she gathered all her staff and as I overheard her she very loudly complained about me questioning the  price of the bill. Then the whole time I tried to have a  meal with my family she and her staff loudly laughed at my family and myself making gestures at me. I finally pulled out my phone to get it all on video and photos. Halfway through the meal we were too aggravated to sit through this awful experience and we just got up and left. Then this awful human being followed me out to my car!!!! My kids were crying! All because I questioned why I didn't get a discount. Some people should not be in customer service. By the way a previous yelper had the an awful experience with the same person look up Melissa b.'s review.
