My friend in Orange County was raving about how good Sam Woo is over there.. So we decided to try Sam Woo In vegas thinking it would be good also along our drive back home to san jose... BOY was she wrong for this restaurant at least...

We ordered Seafood Fried Rice, Gravy Beef Noodles, and 2 roast duck egg noodle soups.  The Roast duck was the only good thing there!  Everything else was literally bland...Instead of Beef noodles, they gave us seafood noodles that arrived after everyone else finished their dishes, and me just sitting there waiting to eat! I didn't bother telling them they made a mistake, it wasn't worth it at all..  The Fried Rice lacked seafood, making it mostly bland rice.   Soup was bland also but the flavor of the roast duck definitely helped spice up the soup a lot.

I think you got the point of this review... BLAND ALL THE WAY!

Why is this place so packed? Is this really the best chinese food that Vegas has to offer that everyone comes here and forms lines in front of this place??

Man o Man, they haven't been to Little Saigon or San Jose yet then that's for sure!!!!
