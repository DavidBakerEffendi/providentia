We went here and they messed up my 3 kids orders and 2 adult orders. So I called in and was promised a replacement order when I came back in. But when I went back in they told me they would not replace the order and their policy is you have to bring back the food to get it replaced but none of this was told to me when I called in about the screwed up order and had the name of the person who told me this over the phone and it was even written in their office book for order replacement and they refused to replace the order after making me sit and wait for 45 minutes just to tell me this. 
This was not the first time they had screwed up our order either. Anyone who has allergies and wants ordered food accordingly don't go here as they don't make the order correctly and what you get home and open your order up and see it is made wrong and you call them and they say that next time you come in it will be replaced and you have the receipt with name of person you spoke to and they even write it in the office book don't expect it to actually happen and you will sit forever to find this out when they have maybe 1 or 2 customers.  
I have never been forced to bring food back to get it replaced. Especially when you have hungry kids who have school the next day and so your not gonna make them wait longer to eat so you can take the food back that the place screwed up completely on. Your gonna call in and good customer service places say we will replace it next time you come in and actually do what they say. Then your gonna do what you can so your kids can eat quickly cuz your kids are starving right. 
I see why this location has only 2 and a half stars it should be zero.
