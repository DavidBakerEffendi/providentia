I've been to this McDonald's twice, one month apart, and I've had the same experience twice.

The hash browns are gross. They taste like they've been fried in old, burned, rotted oil. This is the only McDonald's I've ever been to that's had foul tasting hash browns.

Both times I've sat inside and both times I've overheard the same bitching several times overthe manager having to continually tell a male employee (not kidding around), "stop being mean to the customers" and "be nice!"
