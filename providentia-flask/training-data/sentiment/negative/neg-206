I used to love going to this place but the last couple of times I've been here I've gotten extremely sick! All I ever order is vegatable tofu pad thai and spring rolls so for me to get so sick multiple times makes me worried about why I'm getting sick. Bad food handling or rotten ingredients? I'm not sure but I definitely don't trust it anymore. Too bad, I used to love this place.
