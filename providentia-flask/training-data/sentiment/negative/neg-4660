Ordered a pizza for delivery through the online service was quoted an hour for delivery which was what I expected. But after about 45 min I got updates saying it was going to take longer. After an hour and 40 min I called and cancelled my order because I didn't have time to wait any longer. I was pretty disappointed I waited around and then didn't have time to eat before work.
