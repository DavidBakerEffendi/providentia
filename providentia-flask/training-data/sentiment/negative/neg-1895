We usually love Eggs works, however today was a miserable experience to say the least. We were given a 20 min wait... seated 45 mins later. We sat on the patio and were dive-bombed and swarmed with pigeons for the length of our meal. Secondly, we had a party of six however when the food came out only two people were served. After several minutes we asked on the status of the other meals and the waitress advised us that she could only place 4 orders at a time when the kitchen is busy. The two people who had food were half way done by the time the rest of us got our food ...while waiting surrounded by pigeons. Needless to say we will not be back.
