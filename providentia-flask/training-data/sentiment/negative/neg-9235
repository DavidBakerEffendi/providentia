I hear the pizzas are good. Too bad the person answering the phone couldn't take down my address correctly. After the third time spelling the address, telling her the cross streets and the name of the development (plus 4 holds) I just gave up.  Easier to call Amalfi and drive over and pick up a pizza, than get frustrated on the phone. Might try again when I have lots of time for a phone call or if someone answers the phone that can take an order.
