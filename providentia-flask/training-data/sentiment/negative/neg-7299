I hate to do this as I go there a lot and I really do like it most of the time. My experience this morning though wasn't good . I stopped by on my way to work there were a few cars in the drive thru so I figured I could go inside. There was only one person ahead of me and she was already being helped. The girls working were nice and apologized for the wait..but then I kept waiting and waiting and all I wanted to order was a bagel and an Iced Tea. One of the girls was startled as they now had like 5 cars in the drive thru and in addition to making coffee one of the girls started cracking eggs for the breakfast sandwiches they serve.

5 minutes had gone by and the woman in front of me still didn't have her complete order and I hadn't even been able to give my order, so I left. By that time there was 2 more cars in the drive through so, 7 total and another woman behind me who hadn't even been acknowledged.
I went to the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf instead. Got to have my morning Iced Tea. I feel bad for the employees, they were obviously trying but there were only 2 of them and now that they make more than coffee it seems they should have more staff at peak times...
