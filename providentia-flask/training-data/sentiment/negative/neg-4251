If I could give 0 stars, I would. I was rejected for my ID being a local 26 year old. Bouncer said it didn't look like me because of my hair and looking younger (4 years ago )   Gave him my TAM and food and Safiya card. Manager who was extremely rude and on the phone with obviously a lady friend glanced at ID and said "no, not her ". I felt very disrespected and will never support this establishment again and will tell every industry acquaintance and customer that will listen (I work downtown on the weekends) about their horrible customer service.  I was never asked for any type of info on my ID and even gave a second form of PHOTO identification.   

Also be known I used to support this establishment and tell other patrons it was a fun establishment. (NOT ANYMORE)
