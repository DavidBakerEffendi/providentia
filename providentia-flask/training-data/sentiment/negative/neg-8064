Food Was cold and just ok. Ordered 2liters when food arrived I got cans of soda. I called and the lady only said sorry we out. I explained I wanted 2liters since there was multiple people eating. I also asked why they couldn't call to say they were out,and all the lady said was sorry. Never offered to reimburse me. Won't ever order from here again.
