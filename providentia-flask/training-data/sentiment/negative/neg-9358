I went here with some coworkers after a long day setting up for CES.  We were sat right underneath one of the TVs, which had its volume turned all the way up.  If it was played through an actual sound system and not the TV speakers, I don't think we would have minded, but we used an IR blaster phone app to turn the TV off, because they wouldn't turn the volume down for us (despite multiple requests and assurances that it would be taken care of).

I couldn't tell what brand of tortilla chip they used, but it was likely Mission, albeit a bit stale.  The salsa, for what it was, wasn't too bad.  Definitely not fresh-made.

To drink, I got the house margarita (since it was half off), and it was watered down.  The ice used was very fine but not blended, and drank like the crushed ice from a 7-11.  They don't have pitchers of margaritas, which was a bit of a disappointment.

The menu has *very* similar options to the restaurant next door, and from what I can tell, they are both supplied by the same kitchen.  Nothing really had much flavor in terms of appetizers (we had the "tex-mex" eggrolls, chicken tenders, and buffalo wings), with the exception being the last item, which were surprisingly decent.

For dinner, I got the chicken salad, which consisted primarily of shredded lettuce, with hints of the other ingredients.  The pickled jalapenos were pretty tasty, and they went light on the dressing, which is how I like my salads.  The chicken was the primary problem - lukewarm and very dry; not just overcooked, but "overcooked and left out for a few hours" kind of dry.  A coworker had the same thing as me, and experienced the same problem.

My other coworkers all ordered some variant of the Mexican food that this place offers, and had nothing great to say.  A Chevy's will make better Tex-mex than what they had here.

In short, the food ran us the price of a middle-lower-end buffet, and was definitely not up to par.
