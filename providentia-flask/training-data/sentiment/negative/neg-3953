I decided to go to Honey Salt to see if it would be a good spot for my mother's 75th Birthday celebration dinner. I had read so many good things about the restaurant. From the service to the food it was not good! They are not good at gluten free either.

Our server seemed very overwhelmed. I asked for a taste of one of the wines by the glass. He dropped it off and left. Other servers would wait for me to try it and then get a full glass if I said yes. It took him 20 minutes to come back and ask me if I wanted that wine.

We ordered the beet salad. That was the highlight of the meal. The flavors were good but the red beets were undercooked. 

We told our server that we are both allergic to gluten. We ordered the scallops and the ahi tuna and planned on sharing both. We had to send back the tuna. It was tasteless and the texture of the fish was not right. While our server said the dish was gluten free, I am pretty certain there was soy sauce in the dressing on the spinach (I only took one bite but my tummy does not feel so good today). We chose not to order another dish. I told the server I thought there was soy sauce in the spinach and showed him on the menu where it said soy vinergerette (Yes I did ask him about soy sauce in the dish when I ordered it). He said it was citrus dressing and that hadn't been changed on the menu. I could be wrong but there was nothing in that dressing that tasted like citrus.

The scallops were below average. If you are charging $32 for scallops they should be great. They were cold so the searing on the scallops got lost. They also tasted as though they sat in oil for a while.  The cauliflower was also cold. If you want great scallops go to Mon Ami Gabi.

I was so disappointed. Needless to say we will NOT be having my mother's birthday event at Honey Salt.
