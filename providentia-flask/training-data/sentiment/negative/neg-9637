Worst customer service. My father and I had purchased two meals at a Del Taco at Nellis & Craig, and then continued on our journey which took us to Nellis & Stewart. Upon getting back to my fathers car after our errands, We found it wouldn't start (common issue with his vehicle in the heat). So normally He just has to wait for the engine to cool before it can driven again (simply vapor locks). Either way, We took our water bottles into this Del Taco and asked them if we could simply get some water and explained the situation. They told me the water was for paying customers only (I assured them I only wanted water) and even presented my receipt from the other Del taco down the road. She still didn't care and refused me water. In the end, I'm fine with it but she didn't have to have such an attitude. I had even offered for them to fill it if they were concerned about if I was going to take soda, but they just ordered me to leave. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone who's looking to be treated as human. I respect that they may have an issue with people abusing the soda machine in the area but that doesn't mean they should feel empowered to be rude about it. But this is only my opinion so take it at what it's worth to you.
