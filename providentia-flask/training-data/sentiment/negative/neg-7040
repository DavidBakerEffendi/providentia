Food is average in quality and  way over priced for the portion.  The drinks are over priced as well.  2 beers, 2 shots and 2 tiny appetizers cost $51.00 plus tip.  Not worth the money.  Should have gone to Wild Wings instead.  Took 30 mins to get drinks and then the shots were brought to the table AFTER the food came out....and we were sitting in the bar area....
