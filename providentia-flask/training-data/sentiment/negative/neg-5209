This place does not accomodate people with food allergies.  I am highly allergic to iceberg lettuce and made that clear upon ordering. Long story short , after i stated that i do NOT want iceberg lettuce on my hoagie they not only put it on anyhow but eventually refused to give me my money back. I have not gone back and refuse to go there ever again.
