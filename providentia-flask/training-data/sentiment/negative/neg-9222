Are you kidding me!!  This was the worst place ever!  Service was terrible... had to ask and wait forever for water ..the tomatoe bisque tasted like eating a salt shaker...ordered the sea bass it was so fishy and salty I could hardly eat it. The barley was undercooked to the point it was crunchy.   The wine glass was greasy and had fingerprints in it..   the only positive thing was the atmosphere,  so disappointed that it was such a horrible experience.   Went here to try something new during restaurant week.   I will NEVER come back!!!!!!!
