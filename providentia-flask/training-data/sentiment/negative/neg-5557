Terrible terrible. I'm already not the biggest fan of panda over the years, but this makes it my official LAST attempt to like them. 

I ordered food from UberEATS, with about an hour before closing time. I immediately get a call saying "we don't have any more Beijing beef"....I said "ok, what do you have?".....she paused and said "that's fine we'll just make it for you." Ok cool that was nice of them. 

Then the food arrives. Nice and warm cuz it close by, but I'm at work and did this to save time. Well I ordered 1/2 noodles 1/2 FRIED rice. Well...I got noodles, a lot of them, and a small scoop of WHITE rice. 

Well I said, "I'll just eat it, no big deal, at least it's warm".....until I did eat it. You know that rice,l that's been sitting in a pan too long...with no water...just heat...a lot of heat? Well that's what I got in that small scoop of incorrect rice. Not to mention hat small scoop was buried underneath all the noodle. So even the parts I did take out. Wasn't enough, and I still had those tough, crunchy, rice grains my whole meal. Thanks for being lazy guys

Next time, if you don't have it, tell me you don't have it. Because I'd rather be missing food that have disgusting food
