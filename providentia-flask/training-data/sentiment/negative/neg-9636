This place has changed so much since early 2015. This used to be a favorite Indian take out for hubby and me esp for their naans, biriyanis, chaats, kothu roti and gobi manchurian. Unfortunately, the food did not taste half as good and the potion size has reduced considerably during our last 4 visits. I think the prices have gone up too. When I called to let them know about the food quality and potion size, I was simply told that the chef has changed. Their cakes are quite decent though. But then we are never going back to this place esp when you have so many other good Indian food choices around the same area.
