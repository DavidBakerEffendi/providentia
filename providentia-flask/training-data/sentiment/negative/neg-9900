Hair in my soup once, shame on you.

Hair in my soup twice, shame on me.

I used to love this place for its reliably tasty pho. But then it came under new ownership and everything went downhill. 

Since I work three minutes away from here, I even gave it several chances. But they messed up my order a bunch of times, and on at least one occasion I had to leave hungry because it took too long to bring me the correct order...I had to run back to work. Anyway, the second time I found a hair in my food??? PEACE OUT. Never again.
