Went to this place because we were craving a red curry chicken. Placed order to go total cost for the dish with no rice was $13. Got home thinking container seems small AND behold it was and it was lacking CHICKEN and TASTE what a wast of $13 should have gone to Babu or Tastee across the plaza. NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE OVER PRICED AND LACKING IN PORTIONS.
