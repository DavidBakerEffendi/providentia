We use to eat there a lot, but today I was very disappointed, my hot chocolate was like water, I asked for just biscuits they brought biscuits n gravy, well the biscuits was like 1 wk old hard as a rock, I also ordered hash browns, n sausage links they were burnt. Now my husband ordered  the banana French toast Oooh! It had a funny taste mind u i had them before n they were delicious, but today they were gummy, service was ok, we will never go back !
