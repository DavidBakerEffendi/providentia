I came here for a client lunch. There were a lot of restaurants along Main Street however my client chose Main's Mansion since he's a regular here. We got there and the place was empty. We got a seat instead but there was windows overlooking outside. I ordered the Thai chicken salad my client and colleague ordered the chicken quesadilla and vegetables burger with fries.  They both said their lunch taste fine. My salad was essential chicken stir fry in a sauce added on top of a bed of lettuce.  Since the stir fry was so hot it wilted the salad and there was so much sauce it drowned my salad.   I didn't not enjoy my food at all. I definitely would not come back.  Service was ok.
