The waitress is so nice and friendly but for food is horrible. The service is slow. We've waited for twenty minutes for the first plates and it's not even busy only another one table next to us. The sashimi isn't fresh at all also has very few items. My Bf got stomachache after having couple rolls. If you look for fresh sushi place, it's not the place to come to enjoy.
