If I could give this restaurant 1 star I would. 

Terrible service, I'm pretty sure our waiter was high. He was very awkward and kept coming over to our table and muttering under gis breath. Food is disappointing. How can you screw up basic breakfast is beyond me.The bacon and  potatoes were cold and tasted like they had been out for a day...very stale. 

The whole experience was very weird and disappointing. There are much better restaurant options on Mass on street that I would have rather gone to.
