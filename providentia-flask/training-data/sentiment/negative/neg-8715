I think this place has so many stars, because so many reviewers in Charlotte have not had authentic Japanese ramen. This is NOT authentic ramen. The miso ramen had absolutely no flavor and the noodles were off. The steamed buns were plastic-like. Brussel Sprouts were good, but for the price, diner should be given more. Yama Izakaya or Earl's Grocery in Charlotte have FAR better, more flavorful ramen.
