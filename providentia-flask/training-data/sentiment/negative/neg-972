This is a review on their customer service skills more than anything else, and it was a very disappointing experience.

I had heard from people I know that they enjoy their cakes. I needed to line up a wedding cake for next summer so I thought I'd give them a chance. We had a 4pm appointment but we ended up being 10 minutes late on the nose. After apologizing to the attendant behind their counter I was given a tray of 4 different cake slices to try while my party waited for the manager to come out and talk to us.

The cake was pretty good, and we soon finished it while we waited for the manger. And waited, and waited. I was really confused what was taking her so long because there was no when else in the bakery waiting for anything, just one or two customers that came in, bought something and left that were helped by the two other people working. 

After about 30min I put the empty cake tray on the counter to let them know we had finished tasting. The tray was promptly cleaned up but still no manager. So after 40min of waiting and being ignored we got up and left. 

About 10min after we left the manager called and asked us why we left. After explaining how we had been ignored for 40 min the manager tried to make me believe it was my fault because we had been late to our appointment and I had not properly gotten her attention. 

Sorry I will be taking my business elsewhere, to some one who won't waste my time and blame the customer for their short comings. I would not trust them with a wedding cake or anything else important if they can't be bothered by you while you are sitting in their store.
