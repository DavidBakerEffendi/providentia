If I could give a zero I would. As a server I get people have bad days or towards the end of your shift you just want to do your side work and go home, but Calle 1) took our drink order and appetizer order and took well over 10-15 minutes to take our actual order. Finally she took it and the food came out really fast so I relaxed a little bit, and then I bit into the most dry chicken sandwich. My sisters chicken strips where just as dry. However I didn't want to be that customer and send it back, so my sister ate hers and I was going to take mine to go. Again Callie never checked up on us for refills so I was choking on that chicken the whole time, and I had to get up and walk up to the side of the bar to ask her for my check and a box to go. She was pretty nice but super inattentive considering there was only one other table in there with us. My first time into hooters and definitely my last for this location.
