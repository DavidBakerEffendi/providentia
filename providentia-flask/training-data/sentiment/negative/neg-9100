Terrible service.  We had a large group of about 20.  Our server could barely keep up.  Food was decent but drinks were overpriced for what you got.  A large drink in a Mason jar is $20.50,  ours was weak mixed and when we complained about it the manager and bartender acted like it was a problem to fix (attitude and body expression spoke loads).  Highly doubt we'll return after seeing the attitude of the place.
