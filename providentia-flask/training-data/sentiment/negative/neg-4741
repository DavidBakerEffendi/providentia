The food wasn't bad, but myself and three of my dinner companions all came down with a severe stomach bug the day after eating here. Considering it's the only thing we came together for in the last week, and all hit the same symptoms around the same time, the deduction can't be far off as to the culprit. 

We're still comparing notes as to what we had in comparison to the other four that didn't end up hugging a toilet all night. For now, I'm ringing the bell of warning that you're taking quite the risk going here.
