I was very disappointed with the service at this restaurant location. The place was very empty at the time--around 8:30 on a Sunday night. We stood waiting for the hostess to show up at the hostess stand for over 5 minutes... At first, we thought that they were closed! We were seated in a very strange location of the restaurant pushed off to the corner at a table that was far too small for our party of three (odd, since the restaurant was so empty). The worst service however came from our waiter, who was extremely slow! We waited at least 15 minutes for our drink orders, over 45 for our food, and our drinks were never refilled ONCE! My friend had to eventually find our waiter and ask him for our check when we were done eating. The food was alright but I don't think I'll be back at that location!
