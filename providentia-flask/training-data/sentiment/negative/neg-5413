We ordered lunch for 8 people today and spent about $100.  The person bringing our food out didn't know what sandwiches and soups she was bringing out to us.  She just kept putting food in the table and when I asked what it was, she replied "I don't know."  We had to pry open the different paninis to figure out which belonged to whom.  She did the same with the 5 soups that came out.  The tortilla soup was actually COLD... not even warm!  When we told her, she said to heat it ourselves in the microwave!  I've never had such terrible experience.  I like Panera for breakfast but it'll be a while before we return!  They just opened and they are already slacking!!!
