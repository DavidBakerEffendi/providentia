Stopped by for lunch today and ordered a BLT. They were just opening up when I arrived at 11. She said they got a late start. I asked if it was still the same owner, Sherry, but she said no they been under new ownership for three years. The standards of the sandwich were definitely not the same as before. If you blinked you would miss the bacon in the sandwich. I also ordered avocado in the sandwich which was spread so thin I had to search for it. The new owners have definitely not kept the restaurant up to par. I will definitely not be back. I was very disappointed. My sandwich was definitely not worth the $10 I paid for it. This restaurant used to be booming with business now it is very slow and I know the reason why. I should've realized it was not as good when I pulled up and there were no cars in the parking lot.
