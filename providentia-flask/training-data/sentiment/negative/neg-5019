I went with a friend of mine, quite excited to try this place due to the rave reviews. We ordered one of the bucket drinks which was pretty good so we were excited about the food. I ordered one of the noodle dishes and really did not like the flavour at all (I love Thai food but was reminded of the smell of a public toilet when I took a bite). I asked if it would be possible for me to send the dish back and order something else off the menu as I really couldn't finish the food. Mind you, this is the first time I've tried to send food back at a restaurant since I'm not that hard to please. 

The manager of the place comes and starts to argue with me about the quality of the food and essentially makes me feel as if I'm wrong for really not liking the flavour. He tells me no other restaurant would ever allow a customer to send a dish back and replace it with another one without charging the patron for both dishes. I told him it's standard practice to replace a dish if a patron doesn't like it and charge them for one dish. He then says if he does that for me he will have to do that for 100 other customers. I tell him not every patron you get will send a dish back! He kept trying to argue with me so I just gave up and asked for a box to take the dish home for someone in the family because I had to pay the $15 for it anyway. 

It's a shame I won't ever be back to try the other dishes on the menu which may have been amazing. Probably the worst customer service experience I've ever had.
