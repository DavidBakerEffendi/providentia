We waited for so long for our food. They forgot about our order and didn't seem to care when we asked about it. People came in way after us and already ate there food before we got our order. When our order came, the banana foster French toast I ordered, we so drowned in maple syrup, it was disgusting. I love maple syrup but this had a half gallon of it. Then the chipotle burrito my friend order had no chiptole sauce and was tiny. What a waste of $25. I don't recommend this place. The service is awful.
