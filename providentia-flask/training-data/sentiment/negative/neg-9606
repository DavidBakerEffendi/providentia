Ate there a couple of hours ago with 2 friends. Just vomited for the SECOND time. EVERYTHING was awful. We are all sick and only 1 of us managed to finish an entree. I've NEVER had worse food, of ANY kind, ANYWHERE. We didn't have high expectations, on account of the limitless, free wine, but the wine is cheap and awful. You couldn't drink enough to make up for the cost of the potentially lethal food. I guess their food is always terrible, because the waitstaff cleared our full plates, without question. I might have complained, if we hadn't all been so desperate to get out of there. P.S. Should you ever have the misfortune of being dragged there, don't bother staying for the "cappuccino". It is basically powdered hot chocolate made with water.
