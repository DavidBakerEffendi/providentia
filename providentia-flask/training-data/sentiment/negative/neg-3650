Had an awful experience at Local today. First, the drinks we ordered tasted disgusting I don't even know why they are on the menu to be honest. Our server was not attentive to us at all, didn't ask us once how everything was, and then at the end when we had our bills and were waiting for about 20 minutes to pay, after one of us paid she would leave for like 5-10 minutes, then come back and another one of us would use the machine and she would leave again, and finally one of my friends told her we were just kind of in a rush to get out so if we could just finish paying already, to which she replied "yeah sorry the GM has a few friends here so I'm trying to make sure I'm giving them great service." Interesting, what about all the other paying customers? Won't be returning to Local.
