This place is terrible - now I see why there were so many empty seats in the place. My daughter ordered the taquitos - totally pre frozen - for sure not home made!  My husband ordered a fajita combo w/ short ribs - TERRIBLE - it pretty much went untouched. I ordered the chicken tacos - they didn't taste too bad, but boy does my tummy hurt now!  We would have been better off driving to Elmer's Tacos!
