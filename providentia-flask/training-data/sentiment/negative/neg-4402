Had to write a review after giving a second chance. The good: hushpuppies were decent. On to the rest...

First time I went there, ordered fish platter. Fish was just ok. Fries were old and soggy. Cole slaw had a ... different... taste. I ask for extra crumblies and was given a separate box full of them. Cool! First pinch of crumblies I put in my mouth, as I was chewing I noticed what was like a hair, but more fuzzy. How did a thread of fuzzy cloth get in there?? Weird, but it turned me off to the place for weeks. Just couldn't stop thinking about it. 

Decided LJS sounded good on the way home yesterday, despite the fuzzy crumblies incident. This time... SAME. EXACT. EXPERIENCE. Cold, soggy fries. Meh fish. Weird tasting, warm slaw. Decent hushpuppies. First bit of crumblies I ate, fuzzy thread! I'm guessing (hoping) it's not a hair, but there must be a sweater stuck in their fryer. I wish I was kidding. Lesson learned. Won't be coming back to this location.
