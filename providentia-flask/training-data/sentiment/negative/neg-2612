So, after our poor experience with Wedge early on, my wife and I decided to give them another try for brunch.  BIG MISTAKE.  First off, and most importantly, I got food poisoning -- possible culprits were their guacamole that had a faintly moldy taste to it, the chips that were stale, and the mushy rice that seemed like it had been sitting in a steam table all day.

Even if you don't buy the food poisoning issue, the food was just awful.  Crushed, canned pineapple on the (moldy) guacamole; mushy, gross rice with obviously pre-frozen vegetable medley folded into it; lukewarm coffee.  I didn't even get asked how I wanted my eggs on my huevos rancheros, and they came out over-hard (blech).  The tortillas (like the chips) were stale.  

The service was terrible as well, complementing their awful food.  Our waitress only brought one of us a water (odd choice), asked for our drink order and walked away after only ONE of us answered, tripped and sloshed my lukewarm coffee all over the mug and saucer, and rather than cleaning it up, simply set it down, asked if I wanted a napkin, and never returned with one -- leaving me with a mug covered in coffee.  We had to ask for silverware after our food was delivered.  Meanwhile, the other server was shouting across the patio to (who I guess was) the manager on duty for information as to what various items on the menu were.  

Given there is better Mexican AND brunch options within walking distance of this place, I can't imagine why ANYONE would go here.
