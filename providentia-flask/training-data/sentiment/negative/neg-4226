I've eaten here many times and the food is okay. The portions range from reasonably-sized to rather large, and the dishes are generally well-presented. The wait staff have always been attentive and polite, and aren't afraid to up-sell (would you like a glass of freshly squeezed juice to go with your order?). 

The location is close to my office so it's been regular go-to.

Until today.

My coffee arrived with a cockroach. I didn't make a fuss, and the staff dealt with the matter promptly, providing a fresh pot of coffee and new mugs.

Our server was mortified and apologized several times. She discounted the bill by 50%, didn't charge for the coffee, and thanked us for not making a scene. I felt badly for her, as it was clearly a kitchen and/or management gaffe.

But I won't eat at Over Easy again. I can accept that wee beasties are crawling all over the city, but not in my food.
