I've submitted this same complaint on McDonalds website, but I feel that others need to know about my experience there. 
My breakfast this morning was so nasty, I spit it out. My coffee was absolutely undrinkable (I couldn't keep it in my mouth long enough to determine what was wrong). My egg and cheese biscuit tasted like cleaner and plastic chemicals. It was absolutely the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. 
I honestly don't know why we continue to go to this location. It used to be good, but every time we go now, it's subpar.
