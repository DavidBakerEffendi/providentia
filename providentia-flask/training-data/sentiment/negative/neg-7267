How can a eatery get mexican food SO wrong?!!

I had a bad feeling when I walked in and the lady was looking at us like "what are you doing here!?!!!?  Don't you know the food sucks and you will get sick???"

Well.. I got a fajita burrito and the peppers and onions were boiled.  The chicken was bland. My girl's tacos were crummy too.

If ever a reason to go there I guess the chips and salsa are ok. That would give it a star. But otherwise... I would never advise this place.  Sorry. I hate to be mean. I always try to find something good about an eatery. This place was hard to find anything good.
