Our group of 11 arrived for our dinner reservation at 5:50 pm and didn't receive our modest dinners of grilled chicken and veal burgers until 7:16 pm by which we were famished and almost through the three bottles of wine ordered.  The wait was not deserving of the mandatory 18% service charge that was automatically levied.  The food was mediocre and the service ok but not outstanding.  I will not go here again.
