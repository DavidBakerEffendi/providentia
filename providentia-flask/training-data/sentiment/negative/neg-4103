I know, I usually have rave reviews of everything but this food was not good. 
The only thing good about the service was her lack of clothes. She forgot several things. 
I will have to say that the portions were huge, I thought the price was high, but wow, massive portions. Also, the food looked awesome. Had the food tastes as good as it looked this would be an amazing place. If you're looking for a place on the strip to eat, pass this place over.
I've edited this review twice. It's at one star now because after eating there four hours ago I am writhing with pain in my gut and feeling very ill. I know this is vegas and there's booze everywhere but I am not a drinker. Do not hear here.
