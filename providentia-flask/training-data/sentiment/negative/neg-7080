Jay was The manager on the Gibson and 95 location supposedly. I ordered my food at 1:35am I ordered number two no onions and a dr Pepper and two orders of tacos light sauce and one regular order of tacos total was 1045. I call store location some lady answered the phone and ask who is your manager she says Jay. So I talked to Jay he says OK what's your name I say my name i'll talk to him about my order is completely silent and I said hello then he finally says OK put your name down.  I was like OK he says whenever your ready come to my location and pick up your order we will redo it. So I go to the drive-through order the same exact thing as I ordered. It takes 17 minutes to complete the order. He comes to the window as I asked lady she said you were already here I said yes Kathy such a Jay. Jay comes to the order asked for our receipt and the rest the bag I give him that he can place my order is in my money back and my order.  I go in the parking lot next to everything as good as it should be it was finally the order that I have been waiting for. To whom it may concern please check your staff or hire me to do it for you
