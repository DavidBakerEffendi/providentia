First and last time here. We went to celebrate a birthday. The waiter, Randall, approached us with a terrible attitude. I thought for sure he would get nice, but that never happened.  He was rude and short the entire time. At the end, when waiters usually get nicer, he didn't ask if we needed to go boxes when we had lots of food left. For me he ruined the restaurant  experience. 

I had shrimp and grits, which looked delicious, but disappointed big time because they were bland. If I ever use salt, there is a problem and I used it twice. The food was bland. 

Although, I loved ambiance I would not go back. He must hate his job! Called to let the manager know about the service, immediately after eating, and he was just as rude. I couldn't believe how he handled a complaint. Poor, poor service and a big disappointment!
