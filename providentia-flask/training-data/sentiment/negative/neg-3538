3/17/2016 TV Sound still unhearable anywhere in the bar area. No sound-deadening material to stop the incredibly loud volume of conversation due to high ceilings. 3 TVs behind bar are smaller than new BWW and the TV on the right behind bar has a permanent black line on the screen.

The couple coming out while I was coming in said they had been ignored by servers and couldn't hear themselves talk anyway so were leaving. 

So much potential.
