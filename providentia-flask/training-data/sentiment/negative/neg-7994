Decided I wanted buffet on our last day in Vegas.  I checked Yelp and decided to go to Cravings.  Hence the name, I sure had no cravings here.  Perhaps, I went a bit too early. I got there at 9am.  Nothing was available to eat until 11am.  Nothing tasted fresh here.  The only reason for 1 star is because the waitress was nice.  She came around enough times.  The best thing I ate was the lemon poppy seed muffin. Besides that EVERYTHING was gross.  

No cravings at CRAVINGS.  I really don't know what lunch or dinner taste like or if I were to come at 11am instead but breakfast SUCKS! Complete waste of money.  I feel bad for having to drag my bf along to eat a horrible breakfast.

Barf.
