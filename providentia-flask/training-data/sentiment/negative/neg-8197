oh my goodness!  I have been to Johnny Rocket's for many years in different locations across the country.  It has been just a few years since my last visit to one.  When I found out there were opening one here where I live, I was SOOO excited.  And now I am SOOO disappointed.
I walked in and it immediately was NOTHING like Johnny Rocket's.  Fast Food style, order at the counter, limited menu compared to the real thing.
My wife and I ordered two small combos (like a fast food restaurant but less fries) each with small sandwiches.  Price was over 23 dollars.
Food was brought to us and I must say it was pretty tasty.
Atmosphere is NOTHING like Johnny Rocket's.  Not very full, subdued, no interaction with staff (which is a big part of Johnny Rocket's!).  Was hoping to go to a place with big servings, loud, fun, servers dancing on the counters and of course, I wanted a malted shake!
They had NONE of that.  I went back to the counter to order the malt and was told we don't have that.  When I asked, "Oh my goodness, why not!"  The answer was weird.  She said because we have the only drive though at any Johnny Rocket's location in the world and our menu is limited at this time."
As I said, the food was good, but quantities were no match for the price.  Atmosphere was just like any other fast food place, but more subdued.  People were friendly, and I'm sure after being open a while they will be more competent, but it just wasn't Johnny Rocket's.
I won't be back.
