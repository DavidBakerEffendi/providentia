Probably had the worst experience ever at at Postinos. We arrived at 8 for a bottle and board and it started out pretty inconspicuously. The wine we ordered took a little longer than usual, no biggie, but then we get to the food. It was busy per usual but it was almost an hour later at 9 and we were wondering were our food was. Then tables around us who arrived 15 min before started getting their food. Out waiter was no where to be seen so I asked another employee about our order. Well I see this employee talk to our waiter and he immediately heads to the POS. I could obviously tell he forgot our order and sure enough 5 min later our food shows up with our awkward waiter who didn't even admit he forgot our order and he blamed the kitchen. It wasn't until we got the check he FINALLY admitted he forgot to put the order in. I'm a pretty reasonable person when people are honest. I've worked in the service industry but blatantly lying and not taking responsibility after you forgot us for an hour is in acceptable. Makes me want to avoid this location.
