Not quite sure how the reviews are so high as my experience does not mirror this at all. My wife and I went in for lunch on a Friday and we're the only people in the place, yet there were signs that people had been there at some point because the tables were filthy. Numerous plates with half eaten food were still sitting on the tables. One would think that if you didn't have any customers you would go about cleaning up, but who knows. So this was our first impression, then came the food. My wife ordered the shrimp and I ordered the pork which both came with rice. The presentation matched the taste: bland. With all the flavor options available in this cuisine I'm not really sure how you can't get that right, but they found a way. Will not be returning.
