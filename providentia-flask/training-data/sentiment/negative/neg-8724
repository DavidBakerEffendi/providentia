Eh... not really a fan at all. And I like almost all Mexican places. Can't say I've ever really left anywhere hungry before because I usually don't eat a ton of food but I got the two enchilada combo with beans and rice and the enchiladas are so small and thin it was like two bites each one. I'm sad to say it was a seven dollar meal and I had to dig my enchiladas out of the sauce. I like a decent amount of sauce but they almost completely covered. And in my opinion nothing really stood out in anyway that would make me want to come back here.
