Won't be long before this place goes under. Hole in the wall doesn't always mean good food. Tried the Beef Pho, hands down worst Ive ever had. Beef stock from a can with buckets of pepper poured into it. No aroma and the 'salad' was pathetic, no basil.. what's that all about? I didn't try the other dishes which might be unfair. However I will not be back to try anything else, just not worth it to me!
