Terrible experience. Its never a good sign when there aren't cars in the parking lot. Its a worse sign when there is no on in the restaurant at 1 pm on a Saturday. Service was haphazard, the wait time for beverages and food was long (considering there was no one else in the restaurant). The vegetable pho was was merely ok, Prices were very high for food that was mediocre at best. When paying our tab, the owner overcharged us by $2/bowl and tried to short our change until my husband insisted she give us the correct amount. Bad news all around, they won't be there long.
