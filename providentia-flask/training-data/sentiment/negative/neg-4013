So my family and I just ordered Gyros. Worst meal we have ever had!!!!!!  We call  to inform the manager and all he did was argue with us that he has the best gyros in town. Worst food, the salad was even bad. Will never order from here again, not only because the food was bad but so was the customer service from the manager!!
