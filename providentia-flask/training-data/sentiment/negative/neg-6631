In short, avoid this place because the hostess is the worst in the industry... Seriously. 

I waited 45 minutes to finally walk out because of the hostess's unprofessionalism. From all my life in going to multiple restaurants, i have never seen anything like that.  I gently requested a booth next to the table she initially assigned us, however,  she said no its for someone who asked for it before us. I then requested for another one and then she says its for a group of 5 and not 4.  I insisted on having the booth with 5 seats and then she started yelling at me (litterally yelling) for giving her trouble all the time (everytime i go to this place, i end up arguing with her for some reason).  I was humiliated in front of my friends and was put in an uncomfortable situation. The food is great, and its unfortunate to ruin a reputation because of an unpleasant behaviour.
