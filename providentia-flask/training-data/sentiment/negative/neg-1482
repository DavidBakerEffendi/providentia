My daughter was attending a dance convention nearby so I placed an online order scheduled for delivery at her lunch break. An HOUR after that delivery time had passed and after her lunch break had ended they still had not arrrived with her lunch. When I called to check on the order they were unapologetic and refused to give me a time that the order might be delivered. The answer I got was an unapologetic, "we had too many orders". Well, shouldn't you not be able to take in more orders than you can handle in a delivery timeframe??? Since they refused to tell me when they might deliver it I was left not knowing if I should wait for it or try to run somewhere else hoping to order and get it back to her in time. I opted to wait and hope which was the wrong decision... the food never came. Irate and not only will I never order from THIS Jimmie John's but I will never order from ANY Jimmie John's. Do not order if you need your meal in a specific timeframe!
