We used to love this restaurant when it was called Italian restaurant.
Not so any more. We called for a reservation, arrived on time but they had no record. Our only option was to sit outside on a COLD night BRRRR.
The salad was pricey and so so. To their credit the waiter modified a pasta dish for us and it was yummy. Only problem was they brought out our pizza at the same time. It was soggy and nothing like the pizza we had at there downtown location.
PLEASE bring back your old format.
