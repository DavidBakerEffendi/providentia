Unfortunately I wasn't even able to try the pizza due to the rude, condescending, tone of the woman to take my order. Being new to the area I googled the establishment and saw they had a coupon. When asking for the deal the lady rudely said "we don't do that" after explaining the coupon was online she said "well like I just said we don't do that. It's not our coupon" with hopes of getting at least an explanation I asked to speak with the manager. No better luck. Customer service just killed any chance of me ordering from here.
