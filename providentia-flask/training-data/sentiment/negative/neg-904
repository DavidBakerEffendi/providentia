Horrible horrible.. after reading a couple of reviews I waned to give this place a chance. When I got there  there was a strong smell of clorox but the smell of donut was winning. But then something happend that I don't think people will enjoy reading about . People noticed  at the donuts that there was a  red bug in top of one of them. They  told the girl behind the counter and she just moved  the rack and the bug flew to another donut. After that she just looked at the customer and said  "so you don't want anything from this side, how about the other side?" I mean she did not care about the situation or that her clients were concern.
