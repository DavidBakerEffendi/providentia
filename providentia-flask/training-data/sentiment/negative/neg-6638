Went once with my family when I was 18 and the food was okay. Then decided to go back again during my highschool lunch break with some friends and the owner blocked the entrance into the restaurant and told us "go to pizza pizza or something" just because of our young age. Age discrimination. Disgusting management/owner. Will never go again or recommend this terrible place to anyone.
