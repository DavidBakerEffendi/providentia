If I could give no stars I would. We hadn't been to BLD in about a year because the food was so awful but we came back to give it a second try. Huge mistake. Food was cold. Tasted like it came out of plastic wrapper in the freezer. Disgusting. And none of us feel well after our meal. 
Friends side of potatoes took FOREVER like 25 minutes forever. Then they wouldn't take it off of the bill. 

Service was extremely slow. 

We will not be returning. Ever.
