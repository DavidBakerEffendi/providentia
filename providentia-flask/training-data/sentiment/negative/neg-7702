Me and my wife have been going here since it opened and have had nothing but good service and good food untill tonight.  We ordered the same rolls we allways get cruch roll and  champ roll. When we got home we had our crunch roll but there was a different roll with it no big deal we call the restaurant only to be told there must have been a miscommunication and they would not do anything about it unless we wanted to order a new roll. which would not be happening at $12 per roll, see i am 100% sure we ordered the right thing simply because we dont know even the names of any of the other rolls. they should have honored the mistake they made and replaced the roll. we will not be going back.
