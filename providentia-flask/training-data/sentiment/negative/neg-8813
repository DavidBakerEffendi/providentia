I have to be honest.  I didn't like one thing about this place.  Went there on a Sunday evening because Old Fashioned Hot Dogs/ The old Hot Dog Inn in 41st and Lorain was closed.  Me and my son really wanted a hot dog so I said why not.  Now I say NEVER again.  To start the service was nothing worth while,  I could tell they could care less for children, sorry I'm a widowed father and need to take my son out once in a while.   The noise was rediculous, you'ld think they where setting up for The Who.  They where just starting to set up for the nights entertainment,  soooo much for having a nice dinner.   The dogs where average at best,,, Come on you can't even have regular Ketchup for a kid,,,  poppy seads on the bun do not work for kids as well.  Hate to say it but don't take your kids.  Keep your expectations low then they might deliver.
