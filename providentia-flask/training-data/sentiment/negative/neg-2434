So went on Friday night and evidently they stop serving the drinks on there menu after 10 I believe, probably because the bartenders can't make them. 

I waited 31 minutes for a bartender to address me as I watched them serve every girl in the bar before me. The menu says the beer I ordered was $5, I was charged $11. So I didn't order more because I was lied to. 

I left after staying and being miserable for two hours. When we left the music was so loud I couldn't hear anything like I was under water. 

I hope I never get dragged here again.
