So I'm quite disappointed with the food, dead on a Monday night, is this why? Had to ask for silverware, could clearly hear profanity being shouted in the kitchen. I'm glad my 4 children that had to hear that are all teenagers. I didn't complain to the waitress because I'm not that guy but if you're planning on going here stick to the mornings, that's clearly when the professional staff is working.
