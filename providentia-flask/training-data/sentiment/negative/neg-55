I wouldn't eat here if I was a pot bellied pig coming from a diet center.  

The last time I was in town, I got a rack with a mac n cheese and bbq beans for sides.  0-3, that's right, they are batting .000.   The ribs were drier than the Phoenix desert, tougher than an off-road tire and cost more than Paris Hilton's lip waxing.  The mac n cheese was the most bland, pale, crappy side I think I ever had.  The bbq beans tasted like the cooks (ha) poured liquid smoke in the beans and then left them to cook for 20 days.

I wouldn't wipe my a$$ with this place.  And expensive too!!!

Anyone that thinks this is good BBQ has never had good BBQ.  Anyone that thinks this is good food must be of Irish or English decent.

This one just may make it on my all-time haters list.  That's right Cold Stone, you now have company in the shitter.

Ya feel me?
