(11/10/2014)  Wanted to visit Sienna Mercato on a self-guided restaurant crawl of downtown Pittsburgh.  The tiered concept (a different restaurant on each floor) seemed so contrived.  We were there on a Monday were told that only the first floor was open.  Seems like a missed opportunity, would've spent plenty of money there.  I like a meatball just fine, but rest of the menu also not that exciting, some soup, some salad, and a pile of deep fried or buttered things.  Wouldn't call it Italian, stylistically all over the place.  Sports bar like atmosphere and loud music, and uncomfortable steel chairs also unappealing.
