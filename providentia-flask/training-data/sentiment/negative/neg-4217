Horrible food. The server was nice but the food that came out of the kitchen was very bad.  
My husband ordered a scotch on the rocks and the scotch was watery????    We ordered appetizers and they were basic. The bruschetta was okay and the salmon thin slices was fresh. The main meal we ordered eggplant ... so bad! And meatballs were not cooked. I didn't order rare.  
Needless to say we didn't eat it, just asked for the check.  
.... the manager came (didn't make eye contact) just walked over super quickly and said ok we are going to take care of the bill. We told our server we would pay for the drinks but they insisted on no check. 

.... now usually I would give them a couple stars for taking out complaint seriously, but we headed next door to eat (still hungry) 
And started having s GREAT time! GREAT food service drinks....THEN here comes the same manager (I guess these are owned by same people) he pointed at us and started talking to the manager of the place we were now happily eating at. 
Whatever. We didn't even care about this place anymore. Go to the MExican place. Next door. Much better people and food.
