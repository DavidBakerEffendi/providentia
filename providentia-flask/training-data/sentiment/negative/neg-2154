If I could give this place less then one star I would! It's not very often I rate something this low just because I give points for effort but it's like this place stopped caring and started serving crap! I ordered a taco chili relleno and enchilada combo the only edible item on my plate was the enchilada.  My husband ordered the fajitas and it came on a not a fajita plate just a regular plate with lettuce and pico it was a very sad excuse for a fajita meal! Don't waste your time money or gas going to this place! Oh and to top off crappy food the service is just as bad as the food!
