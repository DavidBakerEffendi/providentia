This restaurant is the reason that yelp needs to add "negative stars". 

The Egg and I sets the bar for the worst establishment I have ever visited.  We waited for 41 minutes for our food to arrive (accurate time frame via foursquare).  They ran out of chorizo so they used sausage in my fianc√©'s omelette which made it greasy enough to wring out.  They served me the wrong omelette.

In order to compensate they knocked off $1.50 off the bill. Yeah, that's right, I wrote one dollar and 50/100.  Although the owner was present, he or she never visited our table.  I look forward to seeing the For Lease sign hanging in the window shortly. I realize that is harsh but look at the previous reviews. Anyone see a pattern forming? I hope the owner realizes this before its too late.
