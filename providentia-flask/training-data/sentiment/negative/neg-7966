The one star is for the service that was top notch for a buffet. The no stars are for the horrible food they serve. I'm a local so I eat there with a comp from the sports book. If I had to pay I'd be very upset as the food is pretty gross. The 2 things that are good are the freshly made omelet and the prime rib. One night they had crab legs and they smelt really bad to the point I couldn't eat them. The salad at the salad bar tends to be on its last leg. Everything kinda looks like it's been sitting out for a long time. Don't pay for this one not even if it's the last food on the planet
