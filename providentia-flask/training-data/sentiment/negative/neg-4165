I called in a Take-Out order about 20 minutes before they closed.  I ordered curry chicken and when I got it home, about half way through eating it I noticed there was NO chicken.  Are you serious?  How does that happen?  I was hoping some of the potato clumps might actually be chicken, but no such luck.  The curry sauce tasted like it was made from a powder base that wasn't dissolved very well.  I ended up throwing away the second half.  First and last adventure with Tao.
