I really love smiths so it breaks my heart that I have to give this store such a bad review but here is what happened. I went shopping to pick up a few things and there was something spilled on the floor, instead of cleaning it up one of the employees put a wet floor sign on top of it, well in the middle of the spill but it was a big spill. Obviously I didn't see the sign until after I fell, mind you I'm 40 weeks pregnant and this could of ended disastrously. I escaped from the incident with some painful bruises but when I approached an employee to tell them about the incident never once did they apologize they just asked me where the spill was. I will never shop at this store again! Bad enough that I fell while pregnant but what if it had been an elderly person? this is unacceptable!
