7/17 630pm  Dinner - Party of 3 - How in the world did this get to a 4 star plus resturant? So we order ACE 22 comes with seafood and beef.  I'm thinking this is going to be FANTASTIC because the reviews are FANTASTIC?  OH NO!... We should have bought a chicken at Costco and boiled it . Would have been much than wasting our night  here. Water to cook with had some greenish gray chips in it? If that is seasoning its not doing it. The waitress yelled at us when we put a little sauce in the boiling water. She said dont do that some customers dont like the smell. Im thinking is it time to walk out. Lets regroup here. I have been to about 50 plus shabu shabu places in the US and ASIA. I have never had to check my seasoning talents. The scallops chopped into tiny pieces WOW did I miss the TAPAS menu? The Red napkins are like sand paper watch your mouth aka lips.  The crazy thing is my 2yr old son would not eat any of the shabu and he eats everything.  Maybe it was the huge fashion star high chair he was sitting in and didnt want to eat?  But wait theres more the free ice cream comes with a powder you have to mix together... interesting! We will never go back for the $55.00 substandard soup treatment !  We make it much better at home with all the natural organic smell... I approve this message J K KOOL..
