Heard a lot of good reviews so I was expecting more than this. I've had their burritos and they were pretty good. Got the chicken enchilada and carne asada taco plate. Chicken was dry and tasteless, as was the tortilla, sauce was weak. Carne asada was OK, but tough, and the taco shell was straight out of the old el paso box. Refried beans were thick, pasty and blah, they really skimped on the cheese, which was blah, rice was only fair. Red salsa had a musty, bitter, old aftertaste. Jamaica was really good! I've had better Mexican at a roadside Cafe in Montana. It was truly the worst Mexican combo plate I can remember. Won't be going back... Ever.
