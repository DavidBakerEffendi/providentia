where do I start? I only came here because I didn't want to wait for the cheesecake factory one day. Theres a reason why theres no line up at all for this place. Our server had forgotten to add in one of our orders and at the end, I asked for a take out cup because I wasn't able to finish the milkshake. He gives a different sized lid for the cup so that it's not even closable. That's besides the point. The food is mediocre. Calamari is basically frozen squid hoops that are deep fried. Onion Soup was far too salty and pastas lacked sauce and flavour. I needed to add a **** load of parmesan cheese to flavour it myself.
