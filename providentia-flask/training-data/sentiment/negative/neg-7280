I do agree with others reviewers, the place is dirty, the windows and floors are sticky and the restroom is filthy too...
I love Vietnamese food, so we are always trying new places...this is the first place that disappointed me...I do usually order pho, but this time I wanted to feel adventurous and ordered a pork Vietnamese sandwich...I ordered "to go" so I tried it at home, it's the worst sandwich I have ate in my life and in top of that had to paid for it! I live quite far so coming back it's not an option. 
The pork didn't had any flavor just a strange paste and lots of jalape√±o peppers plus the bread was very hard and dry...

Do yourself a favor and don't stop here, cross the street to the Mekong plaza and try another Vietnamese restaurant.
