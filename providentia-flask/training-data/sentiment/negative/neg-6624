Dazzling Cafe lacks anything resembling dazzle, and potentially anything resembling an actual cafe.

Came in with a party of four for dessert and were seated upstairs in a quiet little area with a handful of other tables. After a few minutes looking at the menu filled with expensive drink choices and an appallingly small number of choices for dessert, I settled on ordering a royal earl grey milk tea, and the rest of my party ordered drinks and a single pasta dish.

I'm not sure why it took as long as it did to make the four drinks we had ordered, but two of the drinks were completely wrong (entered incorrectly by the server) and took another 20-25 minutes to appear correctly.

In addition, we were charged for the incorrect drinks and the correctly ordered drinks after that, but after a bit of cajoling, the staff finally gave us the correct bill with a 10% discount for our troubles. That was the one nice part of the night.

The food was forgettable, the drinks were average at best (at not average prices), the decor was borderline ridiculous, and the service was bad all around.

Frankly, this place doesn't live up to its name, and the only dazzle I had experienced was in just how much worse they were than my low expectations.

Don't come here, go elsewhere for better food and drinks.
