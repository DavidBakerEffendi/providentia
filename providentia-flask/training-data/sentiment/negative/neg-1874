Well if you think this is Authentic and great food the Mexican cooks you know aren't very good. I went with Authentic Mexican friends and none were impressed by the food. I called it mediocre and they called it less than. To me it reminded me of Home EC, Mexican food cooking lessons of the inexperienced Jr High Student. Oh, but wait... they don't teach Home EC anymore! So grading this meal (dinner) would be difficult. At least the waitress had a cool air about her that said I don't eat much of anything here, so you can't hold my opinion up to any of this feed. That's right feed not food. 
Furthermore the decor and vibe in the place is lacking. Sitting there reminded me of a pass life experience of eating and waiting at a bus terminal.
