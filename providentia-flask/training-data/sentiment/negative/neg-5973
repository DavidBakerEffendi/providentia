After all the hype of listening to people talk about this place I wanted to give it a try. I was very excited to come here. I came here for my birthday and I have to say that this place is completely a bust; the staff were rude, and the service was horrible. You cannot reserve a table because they like to pack you in this tight little pizza restaurant  The bar is a joke; they don't really have any alcohol and the wines were the worst - I tried the Riesling and it tasted cheap and bitter. This place is also very pretentious. I understand that it's more of a traditional world style pizza but everything has to be difficult; they can't just make you a good pizza  -Everything has to be fussed with like some overly pretentious chef-  Before I had a chance to even talk or ask any questions about the menu our server went ahead and decided to give me a full lesson on their ingredients. I guess the staff feel that it's a privilege for the people to come to them and dine in their restaurant. You will not find pepperoni on the menu instead they give you an alternative dry salami, soppresetta, and tout that it's from Shreiners. Shreiners also happens to make excellent pepperoni, so why didn't they just get the pepperoni from Shreiners instead of having to deal with tables of diners asking why they don't offer it? The vibe in this place also sucks !!!!it's filled with fake trendy hipster wannabes who post hundreds of douche bag pictures of themselves on Instagram  eating their shitty pizza. This place blows ........ Oh and to be clear my entire party of 7 people felt the same way--- this place sucks
