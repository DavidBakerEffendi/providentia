So so so bad. First off I got delivery and the delivery person didn't even look at me, he just thrusted the food toward me and left. Now on to the actual food, I ordered steak pho, lo mien, crab puffs and spring rolls and green tea ice cream. The steak came raw with the pho, the soup and the noodles were separate and the noodles were plain sticky and smelled like plastic, there was also a really strange smell to the broth that I can't place which makes me not want to eat it. The lo mien was ok, the meat was really dry and so were the noodles. The spring rolls were ridiculously sticky, the pork was dryer than dry, the shrimp smelled off. Lastly the green tea ice cream tasted like green flavored rotten mangoes, green tea ice cream is not supposed to taste like anything other than tea. I am scared that we're going to get food poisoning. I basically paid $45 to get food poisoning. DON'T EAT HERE
