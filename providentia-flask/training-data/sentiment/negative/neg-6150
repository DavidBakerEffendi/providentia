This place was terrible I got a chicken quesadilla and it wasn't that great, but I only had 30 mins before the show I was seeing started. Moral of the story after my show I was shittin and vomiting for the last 18 plus hours. With that being said I give this place two middle fingers and I hope they get shutdown.
