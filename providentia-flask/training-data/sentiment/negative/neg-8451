I think this restaurant has been around for at least 25+ years.   During my younger days I remember coming here to eat in the middle of the night (the only place that was 24hrs back than).  Quality of food is just as bad now,  as it was before lol.  

I shouldn't be that mean... for the price you pay, it is actually not that bad.  If you order $20 of food before tax, you get a whole peking duck for $9.99 (it was $7.99 before).  But the duck is really really fat and those little pancakes that usually comes with the duck is really really thick. No choice in how you want the second course of duck.  It comes cut up into pieces for you (other places will generally allow you to have lettuce wrap with it).

We also order a plate of fried oyster and a plate of veggies.   Oyster was really bad, can't say anything good about it ($14.95 too).  The veggie was veggie. 

Meal came with free soup and a bowl of dessert (red bean).  All in all,  $42.88 for two.

Will I come back... not anymore.  I have gave this place business on and off for the past 20 years (on average, about twice a year for the latter half of the 20).  It was never as bad as today's meal was.  Not sure what happen.
