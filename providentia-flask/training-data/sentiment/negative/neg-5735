I'm not even going to pretend to be a cheese steak connoisseur; I've probably had 3 in my whole life.  So no, I don't know what they're supposed to taste like but I had one here and the meat tasted like it had been chewed up already, it was a horrible texture, almost like ground beef.   

Let me back up... when I went inside to order the food the three high school girls working the counter were in deep conversation and I had to wait until they were done to order.  I ordered the two sandwiches, fries to split and a soda.  When I got home there were no freaking fries!
  
Hopefully the other things on the menu are better because I hate seeing small businesses fail.  

My one star is for the diet coke.
