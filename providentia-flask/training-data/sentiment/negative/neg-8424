Apryl and I were looking for some sushi. We had made our way to the Canal Shoppes at the Venetian and were browsing the directory for sushi places when we were approached by an employee. We told him what we were looking for and he quickly suggested Samba Sushi, adding that "it's the best sushi on the Strip!"... 

After walking nearly a mile, we found Sushi Samba. The decor looked interesting and it had a great vibe. 

We each ordered a special roll and split another spicy tuna roll. After waiting 20 minutes, three small, thin, very weird looking rolls arrived to our table. 

I will spare you the details of how Apryl and I managed to get these things down, but it was not easy. Hands down, the worst sushi I've ever had the trouble of putting in my mouth. The idea and creativity of the roll sounds better on the menu than it looks, and far better than it actually tastes. Flavorless and lacking any kind of texture. 

Save yourself $50... Buy a can of tuna and leave it in your hotel room for a day or two... It'll taste the same.
