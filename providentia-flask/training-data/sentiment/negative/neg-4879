Fish tacos barely had fish, all veggies on cold flout flour tortillas.     The chimichurri steak was leather at best w a twice baked potato tasting a little freezer burned.    Although our server was nice and service was quick, when I said the steak was super chewy (sirloin) she said well that's a cheaper cut of meat.....I was like yea, I know but for $25......I buy the same cut at the grocery store and can prepare better than that!   Not so much....waste of $
