Shame me once fool on you, shame me twice, fool on me! 

Well needless to say, today was the second time (in a looooong time) I decided to give my DQ down the road a try.... Apparently they don't read their Yelp reviews or even care what the customer has to say because once more as I went through the drive thru and ordered 2 large TWIST ice creams with sprinkles in a bowl the person at the window either needs to have their ears checked, hearing aids implemented or just plain be banished from this earth because I was served 2 VANILLA ice creams with sprinkles in a bowl..... looking at my receipt - AMAZING 2 TWIST ice creams were ordered (so I'm not crazy- Hallelujah!)

Dairy Queen, I'm done- stick a fork in me. And you're lucky I didn't  just throw my ice creams at the idiotic lady who served me... At this point the assault charges that would have followed would be worth it after numerous times you've failed to serve the customer correctly.
