Right off the bat, the person who was seating us gave off a very unfriendly and almost hostile impression. Immediately after we came up to the podium a huge line started to form behind us. There was no one at the podium the whole time as we waited for probably 20 minutes. The restaurant was also pretty mellow. As soon as the hostess comes to the podium thing she starts yelling at everyone to line up against the wall. Since first impressions are so important especially in a place where there are so many other options it seemed really unprofessional. 
I felt it also created an environment where people began to act aggressive towards her as well. It was very uncomfortable and our group was debating leaving right then. After we were seated we were brought to a pretty dirty and crammed table. There were dirty napkins on the ground, there was hairs on the table and plates. It was just bizarre how much of a bad first impression we were getting from this place, but for some reason we still decided to stay. We were quickly given drinks and the plates with hair were replaced which we were all happy with. We also ordered pretty quickly and everything was starting to get a little bit better.  About 15 minutes after we order the waitress essentially says that they can't cook the rice my younger sibling ordered because it'll take too long for them.  My sister didn't want anything besides that so she just got an order of the jasmine rice.
We ordered 3 appetizers: the edamame came first and it was honestly the worst edamame I've ever had. It had weird jasmine scent and tasted way too salty. For the most part, the food wasn't bad, but it was just really average. I feel like there are just so many other options in the Venetian.
