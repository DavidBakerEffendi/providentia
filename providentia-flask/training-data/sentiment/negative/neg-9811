I guess there was a reason the restaurant was empty.  It wasn't good. Had the 2-piece; brisket and ribs.  The brisket was like eating shoe leather. I used almost a bottle of BBQ sauce to soak up first.  Ribs were ok. Better than brisket.  Menu is outdated and inaccurate.  Wanted the mint ice cream bucket on every menu and table tent.  Was told that special ended years ago!! So did the customers.
