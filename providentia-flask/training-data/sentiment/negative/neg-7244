Seriously overpriced! We love seafood and last time we ate here we were so disappointed! The freshness is gone. The crab legs were still frozen and heavily salted and the lobster tails were gross and smelled old. This used to be the best seafood buffet but it is no longer! The sushi was okay and shrimp dishes were okay but not worth the price! This WAS the best deal for lobster but sadly we won't be back!
