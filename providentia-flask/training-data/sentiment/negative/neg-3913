The one star is for their egg salad. 
They lost all other stars because of their lack of customer service.
Why do the workers have such bad attitude?! They are all angry & have  terrible attitude. When you walk in the negative energy slaps you in the face. God forbid you ask any of the workers a question, they will give you the dirtiest look and act as if you are inconveniencing them.
In addition I could not believe that the girl who helped me had a very dirty shirt on. 
Perhaps the business here is consistent enough for the owner but Mr. Owner if you train your staff on customer service and professionalism I guarantee your sales will go up.
Very poorly run business. I will get my bagels where the workers aren't so miserable & unprofessional.
