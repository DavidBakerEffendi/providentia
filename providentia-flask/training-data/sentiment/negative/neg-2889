Gus was very rude, we walked in and were not greeted. When asked what was in the Son of a Classic Burrito he looked at me like I was daft.  I felt like I was an imposition to him  for stepping into this establishment. 
When asked,"what do you have on tap?" Gus responded, "beer." And continued watching football. 

Caesar came by once and asked us if everything was alright.  I asked him for a Miller Lite because Gus was watching too much football.  Caesar asked Gus to make us a Miller Lite.......Gus responded by saying, I'll pour them one.....  Can't make one.   Caesar was great.........  Gus is the most awful bartender I've ever witnessed.  You'll be losing a lot of money with this character.......   NEVER will I be coming back.......  Neither will any friend or family that I know.......

I ate here once in San Diego, it was great food and great service.  The service at the Rampart is poor.......  I'm being kind.  I'll not be eating here again.
