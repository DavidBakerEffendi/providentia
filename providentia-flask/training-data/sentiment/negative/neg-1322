Had lunch there today with my daughter, there was us and another table of people in the place.  My daughter ordered the Rotisserie chicken which was dry and not that good.  I had the chicken and dumplings which were Ok, but not great.  We ordered the roasted vegetables and which were a mismash of strange vegetables which I'm pretty sure were steamed not roasted.  I would not recommend this place to any one.
