Due to the horrible service from the "Service Manager" Meghan, I will never return to this location. My family and I have many great experience at this location including friendly service and great food. This time the food was not too great. My mom and dad ordered ribs that came out burnt and very dry. Of course they ate a couple ribs before making a complaint, which we hardly ever do. After I kindly asked the server to bring over her manager so we can address the issue to her, the service manager meghan came and agreed that the ribs were burnt and should have never made it out of the kitchen. She did not offer a replacement meal, instead took the meal and said she will take care of it. When we received our check, I noticed that a partial discount of $6.00 was taken off of the bill. I kindly requested the server to bring her manager back so we can address this problem again. Meghan comes back with an attitude and decided to argue with me about the food. She insisted that there was only a partial discount because my mom and dad ate a couple of ribs. I tell her that sure some of the food had been consumed but over half had to be thrown out and the total inconvenience should have been enough to take that meal off the tab. She decided to interrupt and give me a lecture on how the food should have not been consumed? I told her I don't have a problem with the $6 discount so long as she would have offered a replacement meal! She was very unprofessional, very rude, with a nasty attitude. She failed her job as a "service manager" and ultimately made matters worse. Her horrible "guest service" was an experience that I never had before, and because of this I will refrain from coming to this location. I'm disappointed it had to come down to this because usually the service and food is great. 
Thanks a lot Meghan. 

Sincerely a family who was looking for a nice meal to eat.
