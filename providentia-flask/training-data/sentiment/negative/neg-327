I thought these hot dogs looked every bit interesting, basically it's a hotdog in a hallow piece of french bread  -  The condiments are also filled inside the bread as well.So while walking through Town Square I gave into the temptation and got mini hot dogs and Nutella filled puffs to try and here's my verdict - 
Yuck!!! The Hot dogs itself had no tasty juicy quality whatsoever and the bread wasn't to my liking either....
The Nutella filled  puffs were  so hard like rocks...
We were very disappointed - maybe I ordered the wrong stuff but I look at it this way : If their basic hot dog didn't do it for me then I don't think the other ones will - I don't care to give this place another try.......
