Just went in with 2 other friends to have an inexpensive sushi dinner and several other parties who came in after us were seated before us. Not only was I disappointed in their vibes, but I felt disrespected enough to walk out. When we left, the "hostess" had the nerve to tell us to have a good night. I would not recommend.
