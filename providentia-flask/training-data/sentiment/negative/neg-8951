This place is DISGUSTING. I was craving a milkshake and it took 109 years to make it thennn when I finally got it, I kid you not, it had a FINGER NAIL CLIPPING in the whipped cream. I was so mortified and disgusted that I had to pull over on the side of the road and puke. I'll never eat at a Carl's Jr. again. THIS IS HELL FOOD!
