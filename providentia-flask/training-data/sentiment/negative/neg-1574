This use to be my favorite pizza place, but after today I won't be back. This is second time I go and the service keeps getting worse. Not to mention the food. I order two pizzas , a salad and wings. After asking to have my salad first several times and waiting over an hour. The wings finally came out and they where super cold. When I told the server she said we can't take the wings off your check. I never asked for her to do so and I was surprise she would say that. Than my salad  and one of the pizza came first. She than mention their was a delayed on our pizza been send to the kitchen. Of course that means she forgot to put our order in. This place is not the same the owner is not like she once was. We waited for ever for our food and it was a disasters. I miss the old staff and
how the owner would check on every table. She use to be friendly. I won't be back that's for sure
