I really hope we don't get food poisoning because the food was horrible. Everything tasted old. We had sushi and the rainbow roll. We also had beef bulgogi. The beef bulgogi had a weird taste and we always eat it at different restaurants. The side dishes were slimy from being old. The sushi was too fishy and super small portions. The service was great but horrible quality food. We will never come back and if I were you I would not come here. It's scary and I'm really hoping we don't get food poisoning! 

Ps. It is RIDICULOUSLY expensive. For two people (and we don't eat a lot) the bill came out to $64. Worst sushi restaurant ever. Please don't come here.
