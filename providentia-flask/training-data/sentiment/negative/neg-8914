We have been going here for years however something has happened in the kitchen that seriously affects the quality of the food.  It is no longer as good as it was formerly. Over the last 3 months or so meats tend to be overcooked and their dishes are full of overcooked rice with little ingredients, such as broccoli, that the dish should contain.  Either the kitchen is trying to save money by cutting recipes short or perhaps they need a new chef.  We will not go there any longer.  This is sad because this place is near our home and we used to go there often, taking many guests there.
