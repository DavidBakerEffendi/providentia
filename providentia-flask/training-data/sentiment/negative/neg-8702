This place has gone from bad to worse! It needs new management asap! Last time we went there it was so bad we couldn't even eat our food! I don't know what they've been doing to their chicken fingers and onion rings but they tasted like they were dipped in a weird tasting floury breading, completely different than when they first opened. My burger was so bad I shudder thinking about it. The staff seems unorganized and completely lost trying to get your order together. They have no clue how to use a $20 off Groupon. I hope they can pull it together sooner than later as I normally really like Johnny Rockets!
