Can't even get a decent soup and sandwich. Sandwich wasn't bad, there just wasn't anything good about. The soup is watered down canned soup they refill with green beans to lower food cost and still charge you more. The Sprite was OK. Never going back. Sadly the only restaurant in my office building.
