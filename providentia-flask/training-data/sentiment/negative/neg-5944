This place isn't a restaurant, it's a circus.

We decided to eat here one day half as a joke and half because I was craving crappy buffet food. Well, the joke was on me.

This place is a mad house. Honestly, for such a low price the food isn't half bad, but the customers acted like a bunch of animals. I guess that's to be expected from a place that corrals you (get it?) from one feeding station to the next like a herd of cows, but still.

I never thought you could make Ponderosa look like a classy establishment but somehow Golden Corral does that.
