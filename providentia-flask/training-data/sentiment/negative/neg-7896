A crowded, large hotel with abysmal service, long suffocating corridors in the hotel. 

Venetian is good for visitors but not for folks staying in. The standards have dropped significantly from several years ago. Like the moisturizer, soaps, towels. Nothing is as bad as how they treat you. I was left with the feeling they wanted to suck as much out of me as it was legally possible. At check-in I asked if I can get a room that faced the strip, I was told if I need a view with a room I needed to pay $45. When I hesitated the clerk added it would be on the highest floor. That sweetened the deal I paid up. Took a long walk with my family up to the room, only to find they gave me an inside view and it was on one of the middle floors!
 When I complained and tried to get my money back they said that would mean me moving to the bottom floor. I call it extortion! not to mention the hidden resort fee.

There is not even a pretense of good service. If you don't arrive in a limo, be prepared to be dropped off across the road from the lobby - the only place where a taxi can drop you. There are no welcome greetings, drinks or even a smile.

Staying in Venetian this time wiped out the really nice memories I had of staying there in early 2000s when they had just opened.
