I really don't care to leave reviews on fast food chains but here I am. I got a sausage egg McMuffin, one of those breakfast burritos, and some fries because pregnancy cravings are very real. My fries tasted like they had been sitting out, they were soggy and cold and definitely weren't salted. They were terrible. I didn't get any salsa for my burrito, because I had a screaming two year old in my backseat, so remembering to ask for it wasn't the first thing on my mind. And I was literally given just sausage and cheese for my McMuffin. So much disappointment. Don't go here, it'll be a waste of time and money. Guarantee it lol, find a better location.
