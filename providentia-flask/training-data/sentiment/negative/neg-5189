After working three 12 hour shifts in a row, I certainly look forward to my first night off for dinner and drinks.  Told my husband about modern margarita and he was up for trying somewhere new. I did notice that they only received 3 1/2 stars on yelp which typically means it's not worthy of attending but the first few reviews were good and the HH menu looked satisfactory.  Fast forward- it took 20minutes for us to get our chips and salsa (average at best) after we stopped two employees & told them & both employees told us "food runner is setting up for party" - as the customer, I really don't care, that's not my problem but understandable....however, the people who sat down at the tables behind us (who arrived 20 min after us) were eating chips and salsa!!! we continued to wait patiently...The second time we told the manager, we also said that we have been waiting to order more food as well as my husband sat with an empty drink (people in the hospitality industry should automatically be looking for empty glasses). The manager nor either bartenders asked to take our order or offer another drink, even after we casually put the empty pint glass on the edge of the bar!  Ended up telling the manager we just wanted to close our tab and leave.  He did comp our meal and apologized, unfortunately, there were too many mistakes and poor service that we did not want to stay.  Yard house is where we went and they never disappoint! No wonder why they are extremely successful!!
