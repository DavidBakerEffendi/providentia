Tuesday Noon, coming to Maamm Bolduc to seat ourselves in the back.
There was no Lines to wait, just walk in and there were 2-3 Tables open.
Maamm Bolduc has this trippy antique-ish eclectic vibe that sets itself apart.
We took a long while browsing through the equally trippy extensive Menu.

As the solo Waiter scurries about multi-tasking but leaves Customers waiting.
The lone Fry Cook mans the Kitchen back and forth occasionally takes a sip.
Lack of staffing that leads to a subpar Meal, I wonder how they handle Weekends.

Clear sight of the Kitchen, I notice a completed Crepe is taken out of the Fridge.
Placed on the Flat-top to be warmed up while my Burger Patty is on the grill.
Cook goes into the Walk-in Freezer to grab some Generic Bun to be reheated.
He's going at a decent pace and the Food arrives at the pass in reasonable time.

We sit there looking at the pass fill with Plates while the Waiter continues to scurry.
This could be the process where my side-order regular Poutine's destiny was sealed.
As we recieve our dishes, I know my Friend's ASSEMBLED Breakfast is doomed.
It's a Breakfast that can be made at Home with some assembly-required.

As for the side-order regular Poutine...

It's the soggy Fries that really made this fail.
These Fries were skin-on and plenty of it.
Every bite was basically eating Potato Skin.
The Burger was nothing to write home about.
