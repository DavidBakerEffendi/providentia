I came here around 8pm and had reservations. Right at the front we were being helped by a women name Candy (I think she's the supervisor) she was being super unfriendly saying she couldn't find our reservation. Someone else had to come and just asked us for our phone number and seated us. We had a party of 6 and some of my friends were running late (about 5 mins). Candy was standing beside our table the whole time and than spoke in Cantonese saying "why are they just sitting there taking up the table". I'm not sure if she knew we could understand but it was so uncomfortable and made our whole experience unenjoyable. Don't get me wrong, the food was amazing but for the price you would expect the service to be at least mediocre
