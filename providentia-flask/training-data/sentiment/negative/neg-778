We had 5 people in our group and there were 4 tops available.  They said they don't push tables together and told us at 9:30pm we'd have to wait 20 minutes.  We ended up in a corner booth in the bar.

When we ordered my husband said not to put any green onions on his food because he is allergic.  His food came out with green onions.  Really? You can't get something that simple right?

I'm so done with TGIFridays.  Bad service with mediocre food.
