I haven't been in this place for long and I stop by yesterday bought some merchandise, bought this Rock Cod it was vegetables wrap with fish inside ready to cook and when I got home the fish smells bad already and I tried to washed with salt and vinegar still smells bad. I tried to cook but I'm afraid to eat, because I don't want to be food poison. I called the customer service next day and they said they can't do anything about it, because the product is opened and been cook, but never eaten because of bad taste. It was so frustrating, because it is so expensive and customer service can't even helped me and not willing to help me as customer with produce that I bought.
