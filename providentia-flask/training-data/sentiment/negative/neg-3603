I am so disappointed with this locations I went here was gonna put in my order for pick up with my t mobile Tuesday free pizza and guy tells me I have to do it online. No big deal I can do that real quick. Then he tells me oh well it's 9:50 we can't do online carry out orders after 9:40 pm. Umm why you don't close till 11 so that makes no damn sense. Then tells me and I can't put the order in manually and walks away. Well thanks for making me waste my free pizza. Horrible customer service! What happened to doing something to make the customer happy. Worst part is I constantly order from this location. No more now!
