Tried this place for the first time today.  The food was disgusting. I started with the smallest, greasiest potato skins I've ever had. And for some reason it took at least 20 minutes to get them. Then it took another 20 minutes and asking two different waitresses three different times for a side of ranch (with only 4 or 5 tables of people in the whole place). I only got the ranch when my "meal" came out and the skins were by then cold. The burger was a dried up little piece of meat on a bun twice its size with no mustard/mayor or any condiment whatsoever. The club sandwich was so greasy I needed a napkin to pick it up. It had only one shaved piece of turkey and one shaved piece of ham on it with four pieces of bread. All you could taste was grease and bread. I may have been able to tolerate the horrible food if the service had been tolerable. The waitress (and the other ones waiting tables on the other side) where moving at the pace of a herd of turtles. Our waitress was anything but friendly. When we said this is our first time here, She said "okay" and walked away without offering recommendations. My drink sat empty for at least 30 minutes before she came around and then actually asked if I needed a refill and acted surprised that I said yes.  All we wanted was the heck out, but of course getting the check took forever as well. She came to the two tables behind us several times but never even looked our way most of the time we were there. We over heard the manager apologizing to the table behind us for the bad food and wait times, but never even looked our way either. I'll be watching this place to appear of an episode of Kitchen Nightmares w/Gordon Ramsey! This place doesn't even deserve one star.
