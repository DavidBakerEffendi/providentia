I have had one great experience here and one terrible. I give it 3 stars because I have to be fair to the 1st experience but as well the 2nd. Both of these experiences happened 3 days apart this last week.
The first time I had a "Pot Roast Melt" and it cost $8.95. It came with a side a fries.
I thought it was very tasty and would totally order it again.The Pot Roast had a lot of flavor and the bread it was on complimented it well. The service this time was great!

The 2nd time (this last visit) we ended up walking out :( We walked in and got seated right away.
This time we were there for breakfast. We sat there for 30 YES 30 minutes and never got asked for drinks let alone had or order taken. I saw the severs gossiping and laughing among themselves. They were clearing tables and saw us but never actually came to our table to serve us. I have to say about 15 minutes into the 30 minute wait the Hostess  that seated us had a puzzled look on her face when looking at our table and walked over and asked if we had been helped. I said "no not even a drink order". She walked away and the other 15 minutes went by. We decided to leave and go somewhere else instead. The Hostess as well the Manager were standing right there at the door and I said "this is absolutely unacceptable and we wont be back for a long while if at all". She did say she was sorry but I mean come one why not her or the Manager handle it? Why would they just let money walk right out of the door?

I enjoyed the first visit, but the second was terrible and enough to make me not want to come back. If friends or family want to eat here then I guess I will be wolfgang stuck, but when there are tons of yummy choices right there on Craig Rd I sure hope they don't.
