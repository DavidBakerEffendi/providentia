The guys that work their are so disrespectful! I will never step foot in there again. It was my first time going there and I was lost and I was trying to talk to my husband to figure out what's going on and the guy just closed the curtains right in my face while I was talking to my husband and basically pushed me back and I couldn't find my husband anymore. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. I HATE SEEING ME OR MY HUSBAND DISRESPECTED LIKE THAT. COMPLETE ASSWHOLES!!
