The Paris seems to be going into a downward spiral. The quality of the buffet has declined to a new low.  They increased the prices at the crepe place so that all crepes are now $10 each. And it looks as if they are trying to recreate the stereotypical French attitude since they are extremely rude to the customers at La Pizza.

I went in one late night last week for a slice of pizza. The lady at the register was a real pill. After I got my $4.50 slice of mushroom pizza, I took a bite and immediately spit it out since the bottom was completely burned, I mean the tip of the crust was the color of charcoal. 

I brought my piece back for a replacement.  The lady went over and looked at the bottoms of all pizzas and brought back a piece of slightly less burned cheese pizza.  The problems with this scenario are (1) I didn't want plain cheese pizza, and (2) cheese pizza costs $.50 less and I couldn't get a refund for the difference.

To add insult to injury, there are no free cups of tap water for paying customers. They charged me $1.00 for tap water on a day when the temperature reached over 110 degrees. It is absolutely ludicrous to charge for a cup of tap water, but you would at least expect them to waive the $1 fee on hot days since you can actually die of dehydration and it is quite easy to become dehydrate in Vegas in late July.

The pizza itself was okay. Aside from the burned crust, it was a tad too salty and needed to be blotted twice since it was so greasy. I guess I am lucky they don't charge for napkins too.
