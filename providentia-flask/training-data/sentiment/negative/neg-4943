My family and I just ate here for Father's Day.  We made reservations and once we arrived to be seated there was already complications with the transitioning from the brunch menu into the dinner menu.  When we had initially made the reservations, the website stated that the dinner menu would start at 2:30; the whole reason why we made reservations at 3pm. That was mistake number one and the had to wait another 30 minutes at a table in order to order from the dinner menu.  We waited 40 minutes until our food arrived.  The steak I ordered was suppose to be a filet mignon, well done and was not cooked to my preference, so I had to send it back.  It took another 10 minutes and when it came back the steak was a strip steak not a filet and just bland; no seasoning whatsoever.  I would not recommend this restaurant, especially for the pricing of the food and the service was horrible.  The managers did nothing and did not apologize for the wait or cooking oversight. The only highlight of great service was from the first table greeter who took our drink orders and kept up the refills too.  We did make sure to give him a separate tip, since he knows what customer service is all about!
