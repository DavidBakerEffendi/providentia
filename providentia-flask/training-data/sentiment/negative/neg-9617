I suppose when ordering a burger from a pizzeria, my expectations were not the highest. I did not however, expect to receive a previously frozen meat Patty that was over cooked and fries that had been cooked in dirty oil.

Ordered from door dash: I specifically asked for salt and pepper on the Patty and to be cooked medium. The burger was cooked well done and no seasoning.
