Customer service from the staff and the manager....slim to none. Stood in line waiting to be seated without any acknowledgement, even though the manager was standing at the front register. When asked if we would be seated, a tone full of attitude was received, "I'll be with you in a minute." Because standing around for a few minutes must have indicated we could wait even longer. It wasn't super packed, we saw 3-4 servers walk by, not one said " We'll be with you.", "Sorry for the wait."
Another woman waiting longer than us also felt ignored. Yet, when another couple of a different race walked in, the server came right over within 10 seconds asking who was next....... probably the 2 parties who had been waiting for 10 minutes, not the party who just walked in the door. We verbally complained and walked out with the manager STILL standing at the front register NOT assisting us, once again stating she'd be with us in a minute with the same attitude she had before. 
Went across the street to IHOP who's customer service was great from the second we walked in, who's restaurant was busier than Denny's but functioned like a well organized, non discriminating establishment.
