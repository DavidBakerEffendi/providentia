This review is for New Years Eve. We came for dinner, we had no problem getting in at 7:30 (we didn't have a reservation) and we literally made plans that evening for our night (that's another story). 

We see the sign advertising $29 all you can drink at the bar starting after 9:30pm. We decided to give it a shot. 

Well, we pay for our wristband and proceed to the bar area. We see two bartenders working. I get the feeling this isn't a good idea, and it's too late now since we bought our wristband.  

I wait for nearly 20 minutes for a drink, I ask for two since I know it's going to take forever to get another drink. He wouldn't give me two. My friend comes back with two drinks in her hand. Now I'm irritated on top of annoyed. By 10 pm the place is PACKED. It 3-4 deep at the bar and still only 2 bartenders. 

Now I'm no bar manager, but something tells me that if you advertise $29 all you can drink on NYE, you might want to have more than two bartenders on hand. 

I ended up getting two drinks the entire night. On my way out, I almost slipped in vomit and spilled drinks on the floor. Classy. 

Will I go back? Probably not.
