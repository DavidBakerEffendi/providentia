There was nothing good to say about this restaurant except that it served breakfast all day and that the staff was accommodating. My husband wanted breakfast and we found this restaurant while biking around Pittsburgh. The food was bland and unremarkable. I ordered a spinach and feta cheese omelette with Italian bread and grits. Oh yeah, the feta cheese tasted fine. But, everything else was really very tasteless. I'll never go back again.
