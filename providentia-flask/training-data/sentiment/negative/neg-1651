This used to be my absolute favorite go to restaurant for the last several years. Anytime we had a special occasion we have always gone to the cheesecake factory. My birthday is January 28 and we went there to eat Sunday the 29th. To give them credit it was an insanely busy day, but that was no excuse for the horrific tasting food that they put in front of me. I ordered the sweet corn tamales and I've never ordered anything else there because those are my absolute favorite things. The plate was scolding hot the food was stone cold it tasted horrible even my guests tasted it and couldn't believe how nasty it was.

One of my friends ordered the cheeseburger with bacon on it and macaroni and cheese and ordered it medium-well... it came out about as raw as steak tartare!!!! They brought her burger then eventually they brought her bacon and even later they finally brought her fries. She ordered ranch dressing to go with her fries and it tasted awful. She's just a young girl and she was so embarrassed and thought she had done something wrong because her meals so bad that my insisted they take it off my tab. Her mother ordered the chicken Parmesan with carrots and mashed potatoes. She said it was actually quite good except that the carrots or better and not at all what she expected from the description on the menu. 
All in all, we were there for four hours from the time we sit down at our table until the time that we finally were able to leave. 

Our meal was handled so poorly by the manager that I decided to find a new favorite place for my birthday. This actually makes me quite sad, but I can always order takeout cheesecake, and I found a copycat recipe for my sweet corn tamales. So if I really want them that bad I'll make them myself.

Our waitress was actually quite good, it just wasn't her fault that the food was coming out slowly and was not prepared correctly. She was delightful and really tried hard to keep us from getting out of sorts.
