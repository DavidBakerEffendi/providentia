This place is awful. I'm literally still waiting at he window, nobody has said anything to me so far, and nobody was in front of me, and it's been quite a few minutes, giving me enough time to write this post. The cashier did apologize though. Very slow service, will try my best not to come here again. Not the first time this has happened.
