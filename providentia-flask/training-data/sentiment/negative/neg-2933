We came here for a pleasant dining experience but we got anything but. Service was good in the beginning but soon went south. We received our salad reasonably promptly but after our salad plates were cleared it seemed like our entree was taking quite a long time. I was able to see into the kitchen and saw the chef(?) and another playing grab ass and having a great time while we waited for our food. This went on for a good 25 - 30 minutes. When I expressed my displeasure at the wait the manager tried so smooth it over. When the food finally arrived it was almost inedible. Way too much salt. Sadly this experience has soured us on the Klondike. We won't be back
