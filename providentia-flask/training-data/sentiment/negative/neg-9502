This is the second time I have tried this place.  This time is no better than the first.  Service is terrible.  I love breakfast out but I don't like to feel like an inconvenience. Food is a little slow to the table,  not sure if it's due to the kitchen or the server. I like more of a traditional breakfast so I got the ham and cheese omelette. It's hard to screw that up although it was a little bit crunchy. Bottom line if you're OK with regular food it's not terrible but the service keeps me from returning.
