As I write this review, I am still waiting to poop this abomination out of my body in order to feel some semblance of normalcy. Rare is the day when you're driving down the road and DON'T see an "Im Addicted to Pete's Fish & Chips" bumper sticker. However, as a native Canadian who has been in the States for over 30 years and Arizona for about 27 years, I had yet to eat fish & chips below the 49th parallel. My husband, a Bay Area transplant, had a hankering' for some fish and chips and thought - "what better place to try than the one advertised on many a back bumper?" So off we went in the Ferrari of minivans...

My husband asked how big the pieces of fish were - after all, you could get 4 pieces for under $7 - how big could they be? "About the size of a fish sandwich" said the guy behind the counter. that should have been our first clue.Both of us are used to pieces of fish being of the plate-sized variety.

We didn't get "fish and chips". What we got was a mystery substance covered in cracker-meal then flash frozen for God knows how long before it's dropped in grease. EVERYTHING lacked flavor, except for the ketchup+Tapatio known as "Pete's Sauce".  The "shrimp" - like the "fish" - was of questionable origin... about as authentic as the "Rolex" you can get from the guy with the trench coat in New York. The fries were bland - totally tasteless. Not sure what was in that plastic packet that claimed to be "Malt Vinegar". 
 
If the Mother Country knew these yokels were wearing the Union Flag on the backs of their uniform shirts, we'd be thrust into war with her, for certain!

The whole experience forced me back into my Canada Rule. Never again. 

Really deserves no (or negative) stars... but Yelp won't let me grade that low.
