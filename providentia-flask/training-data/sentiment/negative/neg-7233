Shawn gave it a 4??? 

Stay away from drivethru

Sitting and waiting behind the guy who ordered some silly item from swisschalet, you see your bags at the window getting cold, because they didnt build this location to park orders.. You get your food and its c.o.l.d... Lovely

Go in and get take out or dine in... Stay clear the drive... 3/5 if they ditched swiss chalet from drivethru
