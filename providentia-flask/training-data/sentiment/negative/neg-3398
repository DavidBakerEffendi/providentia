Worst customer service and experience I've ever had with delivery from any eatery.

Ordered, 2 hours later our order arrives and it's complete trash. Cold food like it had been sitting for the entire 2 hours, whipped cream was literally separated and watery, french toast ice cold. The breakfast burritos? They sucked. 

After calling the restaurant they said they'd return my cash refund and of course never did. I wasted another hour of my time after waiting for their refund that the manager ROBIN said she'd return. NOPE. Today I call back after I've already left town and they're offering a 50% discount on my next order? That's different than when you said you'd return my cash that same day but NEVER actually showed up. Wasted a ton of my time, don't insult me too by offering your "50% discount". It's not a discount, your food sucked. Give me my money back.
