Well, I've been looking forward to trying this place for a while... But the excitement was short lived.

The grocery store area is very charming. The service wasn't bad, but not personable or memorable. 

We got the platter with chicken, pulled pork, and brisket with macaroni and cheese and baked beans for the sides. We also tried the crab cake salad. 

The iced tea was really tasty! They have multiple sauces so we found 2 we thought were good.

First of all, the meat platter was really small for 16 dollars. The brisket was so dry it looked beyond dead and it was chewy like it was recooked from the day before. The pork was also very dry and pretty flavorless. The chicken was surprisingly pretty decent although nothing to write home about. The crab cakes were okay, but mostly tasted like fried breadcrumbs. Salad was just a bed of spring mix with tomatoes and nothing much else to speak of.

As for the sides.... The macaroni had a good flavor but had completely separated and all the grease was laying on top.. Pretty much seemed to be microwaved from another day.  The beans were lackluster just like everything else, but also really provided no texture. 

Overall, it was a cute place with good iced tea, but my advice is try little miss BBQ instead.
