Stopped by here on 6/10/12 and had a bad experience. I ordered the island breakfast plate with the Portuguese Sausage, Eggs and Rice. It was underwhelming and the plate looked like a picture with an abuse of negative space. The hash browns came out looking like they were a frozen product. A restaurant specializing in breakfast serving me something that looks and tastes like a frozen product is a bit of a pet peeve for me. Our toast was burnt, refills took too long, I was left wanting for a straw but our server disappeared. We got more service from the guy busing tables. We had the sad face egg up and finished our meal before anyone paid attention to us.

It'll be a while before I return.
