I work across the street, so when this place opened up I was pretty excited to try something new. They actually came and served some food at my work, which is when I first gave it a try. The food was great and got me to go in and get more. My second visit, the food just tasted kind of off. I was a little disappointed, but I didn't want to let that ruin it because the first time was amazing! I went in a third time and got something similar. Again, it just tasted off. 4 hours later I couldn't get up off of the toilet and was also puking my guts up. I won't ever go back there again.
