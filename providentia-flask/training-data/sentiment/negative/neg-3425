I went here for the first time with my family on a Monday night, and while I had a fun time (because I don't let a bad facility ruin a good family time) the place was garbage.
The service was incredibly slow, like an hour to get the food we ordered and probably 20 minutes for drinks.
Our waitress was super sweet but the other workers were crabby and rude.
We ordered chips and guacamole which you would think would be a pretty quick appetizer...it was part of that one hour wait I told you about. I mean I think they're planting and harvesting the damn avocados. Like I said, this was a Monday night it wasn't busy and I didn't see any avocado trees...
Oh yeah and the chips came out stale.
And the manager somehow tricked my uncle into purchasing Top Golf memberships when he was told they were free lol! But that was some kind of ridiculous miscommunication.
Anyways, slow service, crabby workers and stale chips. I'd rather not come here again. Which is too bad because it COULD be a pretty fun place!
