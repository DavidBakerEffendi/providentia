Worst service ever!  I ordered soup and it came without crackers.  When I asked for them they didn't come until I was almost finished.  My husband ordered a salad with his spaghetti.  The salad didn't come until he was half finished with his spaghetti.  No apology for any of it.  The food was mediocre at best.
