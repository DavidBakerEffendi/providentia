Oh Wow No. 
This place had been on my list of brunch locations for a while, but boy was it a waste. The food tasted great, the d√©cor & ambiance was wonderful but the service was just unbearable, thus ruining the entire experience. 

Our server seemed to be upset with us from the moment we sat down. He never even came back to check on us when our food had been served to us (by another waiter, who dropped it and ran) until we were completely done eating - to which some items were missing or sides were wrong. 
We were the only ones not to have our umbrella put up while sitting in the sun, the drinks were slow and the checks took for-ev-er. 

We spoke with the manager, explaining the experience we had to which she seemed surprised, but not truthfully empathetic at all. She took off one side dish and tried to give us 2 coupons for free appetizers when there were 4 of us - her explanation being that she "thought we would be coming back together in pairs." 

I'm not a fan of writing bad reviews, but Oh Wow - I'd absolutely recommend avoiding this location for brunch. I certainly hope their dinner service is better.
