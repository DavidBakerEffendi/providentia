Save yourself money and time by going to the Rio instead. The Rio's about half the price and the line outside moves quicker. This buffet was a massive let down. I'm a local and brought my mom there for birthday. $32 per person is fine when the food is good. Not the case. Servers were great but nothing could save the food :(
