Words can't express how absolutely disappointed I am in the take out service I received at B.GOOD  in Charlotte, NC! Not only was my food not ready in time, but it was sloppily thrown together. Even better? When I got home and opened my food, I find my burger bun completely burnt. On BOTH SIDES. Their employees consciously put this obviously burnt sandwich in my bag with no problem. I drove uptown on one of the busiest nights for this meal & deserve much better service than I received. Please do better. I couldn't  even go back to remedy this because the restaurant was already closed. I have excused the poor service in the past because your food is so good, but tonight was inexcusable. 

What makes this worse? Over 17 hours and no response from B.Good. I've contacted them on various platforms. We all deserve better when we spend our hard earned money.
