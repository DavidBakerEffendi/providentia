We just left Slice 19. Now we're headed out to get dinner. My husband and I went to Slice 19 this evening for dinner. Apparently, it's Taco Tuesday, but we weren't in the mood for tacos, so we told our server that we'd order off the menu. When asked if they still had their "summer" dinners (that were still in the back of the menu), our server had to ask another server. He came over, and after discussing it, both servers left to go find a printed copy of their new menu. After a minute, they both came back and the male server verbally told us the new dinner menu. I ordered the shrimp scampi, along with a side salad, and my husband ordered the skirt steak - medium, with a green sauce. Our server wasn't sure if the steak came with a salad, so my husband ordered one anyway.
After eating our salads, our "dinner" came out. My shrimp scampi was 6 shrimp on a plate - $12.00. My husband's "medium" skirt steak was a very small portion, over cooked - beyond well done! They called this skirt steak an entree, but all it was was an over cooked steak with green sauce - for $15.99. We found out my shrimp scampi was an appetizer, not an entree.
After telling our server about the overdone steak, she told us that she'd take 10% off my husband's steak.
So, a $40.00 "meal" and we're out looking for another restaurant for dinner.
