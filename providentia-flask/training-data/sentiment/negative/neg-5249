I know many people who used to go there who work and live close and no longer do business there. I go by there every day and go out of my way to go somewhere else. I could hang out there most afternoons and drink coffee but they have purposely made it a place where people don't want to hang out. One morning the owner actually sighed when a coffee was ordered and a pastry was turned down. If I'm going to buy over priced coffee I'm going to go where I can sit and enjoy the atmosphere and feel welcomed, this is not that place.
