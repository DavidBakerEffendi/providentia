So, after almost 3 hours and spending over $100.00, we were told by our server in the bar, the "regulars" thot we were too loud!  There were maybe 5 people other than our party in the bar, 3 of t hem were alone & playing at the video poker machine.   It's a bar!  Then, when i called to speak with the manager to advise what my feelings were, he stated he would make the regional manager aware of the situation, since she was "right there" & they would contact me.  Still waiting!
