My wife and I took our mother here for an early lunch. The waitress sat us right away. There was not many people there so that was expected. The atmosphere was nice. The place was very clean and the temp was nice and cool. The waiter came over about 10 min after we sat down to ask us what we wanted to drink. 5 minutes to long. We ordered 2 waters and a black tea. 15 minutes later the drinks came. Wow. I was in ahh on how long it took to get our drinks out. They also brought out chips and 2 sides of salsa. Those were ok at best. I ordered the number #23. Thats a 3 item combo. I chose 2 cheese enchiladas and 1 beef burrito. My food was excellent i enjoyed it. However it took 37 minutes to get to me. My wife also ordered a #23. She had 1beef buritto and 2 chicken tacos. The buritto she said was ok and the tacos were just plain and terrible. She stated she woud rather have "Robertos" next time. My mother ordered a shrimp dish and she stated it was good but she requested no avacados. When her meal arrived it had avacados everywhere. There was NO apology for the mistake. The waiter just walked off. We had to damn near beg to get a refill on our waters. The check came out in 2 minutes. They got that done fast. It wad $50.00 i feel as if i was robbed. The only thing they wanted was my money. Crappy service. I will go somewhere else next time. Thumbs down!
