It's dirty.  I was sat at a table that had not been wiped my plate was dirty silverware was dirty and the coffee saucer was dirty.  I remember going to Steak and Shake as a child and absolutely loving it what happened to this once great company? 

CLEAN UP YOUR PLACE.

To top it off there was no soap in the men's room, I hate to assume how long that has been empty.
