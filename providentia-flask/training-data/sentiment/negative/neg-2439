I went in for lunch and forgot my rings there. Realized I forgot them maybe five minutes after we left so I called and they said they were holding them for me. My boyfriend showed up to pick them up and he said the lady helping him would not speak English to him, so he got flustered and took what she gave him and left.

Upon looking at what they gave him, my vintage silver spoon ring and vintage turquoise ring (all at an almost $100 value) were missing.

You'd be hard pressed to find a thief who would work fast enough to sift through my rings before the busser came and steal only the two expensive ones. I'm extremely disappointed in this business and it deeply saddens me that Teharu Sushi can stay open as a business and steal from their customers.
