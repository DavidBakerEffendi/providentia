This is the worst Long John Silver's I've ever been to. The fish was dry. The chicken was barely edible. They only offer fries or coleslaw as your only side options. They don't even put those little batter crumbs you get at every other Long John Silver's. The employees are extremely rude and unhelpful. Plus on top of that, my food had a slight taste of tacos or some other kind of Mexican food. I guess that's what happens when you combine a Long John Silver's and a Taco Bell and put them together in the same building. I won't be back.
