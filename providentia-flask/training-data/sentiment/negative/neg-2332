We waited an hour for our order of the Sushi Regular. Its very pricey for a very small amount of Sushi. 14-16 bucks for 13 pieces of sushi. It is not worth it. The quality of the sushi? It was soft and tender but prepared awfully. It broke apart very easily.

The price wouldn't have been an issue but the waiting amount was crazy. The place was empty and it still took an hour. I trusted Yelp on this one and was highly disappointed.
