Very disappointed with tomato basil soup, it tasted like tomato sauce right out of a can,  The soup was drenched with olive oil. Yuck! I sent it back but apparently the waitress insisted the soup I "really" wanted was the lobster bisque soup" I told her I don't like lobster so I can assure you I know my what soup iv'e been ordering for the last 3 years,  According to the cook the soup hasn't changed since 2001 that what he told her. Oh please give me break I use to come to Sammy's strictly for the basil soup and it's not the same!  So my next course of meal I ordered which was  Spicy Thai Grilled Chicken tasted like it was 3 week old salad with saggy chicken! Nasty! I will never go again! Sadly Sammy's on Sahara is no longer a place for good food and good service.
