There dining room supposed to be open till 10 but when I got there at 945 the doors were already locked some guest left so I went through the door and the guy in the front claims to be a manager and says they go by there register time which I guess must be 15 mins or more off then he says and I can refuse service to anybody and I'm not helping you order food. Terable guest service and they obviously don't care about making a sale eather do not go here at least Jack in the box down the street welcome us.
