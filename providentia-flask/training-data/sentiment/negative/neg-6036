Ordered carry out online here, the food was made fairly quick which is why I'm giving a 1 star, but make sure you receive everything you paid for on your receipt, because they charge for stuff they forget to give you and the customer service is poor and the manager that helped me was not helpful nor cared that I drove back from my house. Staff is FORGETFUL and robotic. I approached the counter and the same guy that FORGOT to give me my item asked what I wanted to order. Like cmon bro you can't be that forgetful, you just saw me a few moments ago and just got off the phone with me.. 

I'm not returning back here again and that's a fact..and how about we make it even, I'll be the forgetful one this time, because this Pizza Hut app I got, that I just forgot about, just got deleted *
