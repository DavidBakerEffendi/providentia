So, lunch went like this:

Appetizer: Minestrone soup that tasted like it came out of a can. Bowl wasn't even filled.

Main: Pizza was dry-crusted and lacklustre. Not like a pleasantly crisp, toasted to perfection cracker either. Just dry and dull. Very skimpy on the toppings (vegetables).

Dessert: Cannoli that were sitting filled all day. The filling had a dried surface and the shell was soggy. I actually sent it back and was presented with acceptable cannoli.

The server was nice, but seemed clueless about the food. She might have been new, but what does that say about the training? The service was also quite slow. Seems like this is an isolated bad experience, but yikes.
