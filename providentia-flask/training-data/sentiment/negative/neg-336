Friends from NYC came into town and wanted to try Teharu Sushi. First off, I HATE sushi...but that's okay. I figured they'd have other items on the menu. We were seated and our waiter took forever. Finally I'm ready to order and was informed that Egg rolls are no longer available but are listed on the menu since he started working over a year ago. No Egg rolls? Dang Yo! We just chilled and enjoyed a great conversation and waited to eat somewhere else. I hope to never see this place again.
