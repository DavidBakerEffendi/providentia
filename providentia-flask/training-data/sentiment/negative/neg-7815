Worst experience ever. 
I was clear, gave them picture references, color samples, 6 weeks notice, and followed up 4 times. I wanted something simple with very clean details, because it was basically a striped black and white cake with a heart on top. Stressed lines being the most important because there wasn't much detail. They were so confident and excited every time I spoke with them. We showed up and they clearly forgot about our order. They decorated it in the back while lying to us and keeping us waiting. Two and a half hours after pick up time they brought it to us and it was horrible. The baker was so rude and stressed it was perfect and had no idea what we didn't like about it. Almost ruined the party because we were there so long we didn't have time to set up the rest of the party. They insisted on full price and had no remorse. I only took one picture to send my husband and it didn't even show the horrible close up errors. Lines were stretched out and broken all over. The top was poking out and lop sided. It was sloppy overall. The heart was even totally wrong. It was SO bad and expensive, and I was SO upset. Never again. I have gone in the past and had great experiences but even the cake tasted dry. The overall quality has gone down. BIG TIME.
