NEVER AGAIN!! Went for lunch with my wife on a Wednesday.  We sat at 12:25 PM.  We ordered the Kibbie and  two Chicken Salad Rolled Pitas.  We asked to have all of the food come out together as we were in a bit of a hurry.  We inquired about our food at 12:50 PM when we noticed guests seated after us were served some appetizers.  We also commented that the gentleman who was seated just before us finished his meal, paid, and had left the restaurant.  Our server mentioned that our food would take longer because we ordered food that had to be cooked.  We sat and sipped on our drinks until 1:10 PM and we could not take it anymore.  We asked for our food to go.  The hostess/manager apologized and offered to throw in desserts.  We declined the desserts, and she comped the Kibbie.  We waited another 10 minutes at the front door as our food was still not ready.  As we walked out the door the hostess/manager mentioned that a trainee was in the kitchen, and that was the reason for the delay.  It was a frustrating experience, and I will not go back.  You cannot have a weekday lunch go an hour without any food.  It is inexcusable.
