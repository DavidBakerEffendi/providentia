Don't get me wrong, the first time I came here it was ok. The food was good, the service was average and I liked their food-ordering system; I thought it was unique and efficient.  It wasn't until I went the third time I went that I found a bug in my soup. I HATE making scenes so I simply picked it out, I wasn't able to finish my plate. I have worked in a number of restaurants so I know that sometimes(rarely) these things happen.  

I came back to the restaurant because I wanted to like it.  Tonight I went and ordered, TO GO, some Shoyu($9) plus two extra noodles($4) and a mango creamy soda($2.95).... she charged me for everything plus tax of course.  I was in a rush so when she gave me my order I checked the number boxes, there were 3, plus a container of soup. I had believed that those three were my noodles (shoyu + 2 extra). 

I have been craving noodles for about a month now so imagine my disappointment when I get home and realize that there is a box of noodles missing.  It turned out that one of the boxes contained the toppings and not my noodles. I don't mind that it was missing, I mind that I was CHARGED for a meal I didn't receive.

I will no longer be visiting this establishment.
