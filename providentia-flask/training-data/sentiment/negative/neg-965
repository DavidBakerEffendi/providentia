Went there to get color, Vanessa the owner and "so called stylist" quoted me $55-65 for a color.  She had me there from 1-3:30 for just a color.  She was taking people while doing my hair, she even stopped and did an interview for hiring someone while I was sitting there.  She kept asking other girls in the salon to wash my hair, comb my hair, blowdry my hair and was doing other peoples cuts and colors while doing mine.  I felt like a petting zoo.  After all that my hair was noticeably a pink color throughout and bright pink in the front.  I asked for a mahogany color.  I told her I did not like it and it was uneven colored and she told me to just wash it 10 times to get color right, she even tried to send me home with some brown color to do myself, isnt that what I paid her for?? When I went to pay she charged me $165.00 for just a color!!!!  She said it was because she had to use more color on me, I have been coloring my hair for 20 years and have never been charged more than $135 for a cut AND color...let alone just a color!!  She told me to call her and she would fix if I still didnt like, I called her next day because after washing my hair 4x in shower it accually got brighter and she told me she would fix but would charge me again!!  Are you kidding me??  Terrible!!!!!
