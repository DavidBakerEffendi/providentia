Extremely slow service especially when there was only 4 other tables. Took the server 5 minutes to come to the table to get our drink order and realized after we stared at her and didn't answer that we didn't have menus. Also took 30 minutes to get our two meals. Which was a breakfast quesadilla and a scramble. Didn't refill our drinks. There were also kids running around behind the counter. Try somewhere else for breakfast if you're looking in the area.
