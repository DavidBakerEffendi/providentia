Nope.  Not todaaaaaaaayyyyy.  2nd worst Chinese buffet  Ive had in Charlotte.  Bathrooms horrible and stinky.  Entire restraunt interior dated, worn, gloomy, and dirty.  Food selection bad.  Only 1 shrimp option during lunch, was unpeeled deep fried.  Too hard to peel and eat and I don't eat with peel on.  General Tso's was watery and tastless, breading waterlogged.  The General is rolling in his grave as you read this.  Crab Rangoon not homemade, minimal filling.  Sesame chicken too sweet and waterlogged, sauce tastes like marshmallow.  BBQ chicken not bbq, was watery and faintly tastes like Chinese 5-spice.  Calamari was rubbery with a waterlogged salty coating.  Hot wings submerged in red water.  Cheese mussels okay, best thing on buffet.

Save your money and get something from Caribbean Hut or Flying Saucer, both are in the same complex.
