Worst Popeye's anywhere.  They do not serve spicy chicken at all.  This location should be called  POOPYEYES, since they do not serve spicy chicken.  In fact if you like spicy chicken go to the Skyline casino down the street and order either there wings or chicken fingers.  I order the fingers with extra hot wing sauce on the side.  Much better than POOPEYES.
