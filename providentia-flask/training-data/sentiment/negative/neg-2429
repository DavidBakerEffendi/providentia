Two doors. Is one an entrance? Is one an exit? Are they both exits? They should be cause you'll really wanna leave this place once you're inside. 
First off, We based a book off its cover but it was better than I expected based on the outside. Took a while for waitress to come by. I saw a special for $5 bloody Mary's on their photos on yelp but didn't see it on the menu here. Thought I'd ask anyway and it, in fact, was a special. Who knew? Not anyone else unless they were on Yelp. Also got an order of 10 wings (oh you just wait). Bloody Mary came out and before coming out I said "you can't go wrong on a Bloody Mary". But they did. My Bloody Mary was weak and watered down. Kinda like I've been drinking it for an hour already. We got the honey gold wings and the sauce was good. The wings themselves were overly crispy and didn't have much meat on them. AND they only gave 7 wings instead of the ordered 10. Didn't really bother asking for the remainder. We left and likely not going to return.
