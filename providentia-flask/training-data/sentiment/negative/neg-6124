It was solid food and overall good atmosphere. We ordered a to go order though and they didn't give us what we ordered. They only gave us a third of what we ordered and I had to call to find a solution which ended up being a free entree if I ever end up there again which was a little disappointing because I would have just rather had them negate what I paid for and didn't receive; but the manager told me we'd have to come back in to reimburse my card, which I've worked at plenty of restaurants that are able to negate a pending transaction.. So I got ripped off in the end which never feels great. I don't know how restaurants that are not fast food places get the one thing wrong that their supposed to do right which is give people what they paid for.
