000000 STARS GOOD LUCK AND GOOD NIGHT Heard this spot is a great place to go......not even close! planned to come for a friends birthday. Scheduled plans based off the online event calendar and upon showing up with ten nicely well dressed high fashion people they wouldn't allow us in because one friend in the group was wearing a white moschino T-shirt saint laurent collection 1 shoes and a nick Fouqet hat and supposedly they don't allow any white shirts. I requested to speak with the manager as it seemed weird that 10 of us in high fashion clothing wanting to spend all night on shots and a table wouldn't be allowed in for one white 500 dollar shirt. They said the manager wouldn't be available until 11 am and there wasn't anyone available to talk to. Feeling like an idiot for planning and pitching this place to our entire 10 person Chic bday group for weeks when the guest that got inside behind the door guard was wearing a TJ max black billabong T-shirt.........NEVER AGAIN!!!!!! SO EMBARRASSING FOR THEM!!! i'm sure they feel real cool losing another 1000+ dollars we were planning on spending at their bar coming from out of town for birthday and specifically planning to come to their place. Good luck Gold Spike! Ur a joke.
