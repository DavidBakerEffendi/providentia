I made the extra effort to come to IHOP just for a bad experience. It was super noisey, Uncontrolled kids, and to top it off the food was bad. My bacon folded like a tortilla, My hash browns were gooey as mash potatoes, The eggs were okay because you can't really mess up eggs. I'd say the best thing out of my meal was the wheat bread.  

A+ effort for my waiter having to work in such an environment, she made the experience tolerable.
