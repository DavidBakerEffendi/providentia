Both my husband and I left our buisness cards to your hostesses. We told them how rude and obnoxious our server was and they all agreed and knew how he was. We had hoped management was notified but it's obvious he is still working for you. Thank you but no thank you. Its Vegas, lots of better place to be. Good luck!
