This is the third time I've been here to this location and I've received the SAME crappy service from the SAME waitress. Her name is Leslie and if you can, avoid being in her section at all costs! She came and checked on my table ONCE in 45 minutes. My cup of coffee sat empty for 30 and only when I talked to the manager did I get any kind of service. Never coming back to this location. Would give 0 stars if possible.
