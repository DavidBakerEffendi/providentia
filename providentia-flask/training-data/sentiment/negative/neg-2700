Had the Lolo pulled pork sides: green beans, baked beans and creamy slaw. Pulled pork had no flavor, not even a hint of smoke, was super greasy and blah. I had to douse it in more vinegar just to get it down. Green beans were great. Slaw was forgettable, way too sweet and creamy (I guess that is why they clarify it as creamy). Baked beans were ok but be warned very sweet and sugary. Overall, the focus should be on the BBQ and it was forgettable.
