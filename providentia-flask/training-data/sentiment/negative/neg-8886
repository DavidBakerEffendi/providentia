This was the last resort since the restaurant next door was closed due to a visit from the health department. 

This place was pretty clean. The service was bleh. The lady was the cook and cashier and didn't give you the warm and fuzzies. She burnt my chicken fingers... I didn't not complain since I was pressed for time and didn't want my friend's food that was almost done to get "something extra" on it. 

I will never come back to this place. :(
