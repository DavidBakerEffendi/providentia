We just returned from a 3 day stay and were disappointed.  While the rooms are nice (suites, big), the bed was terrible.  The mattress was worn out and was not level (you'd roll off the bed!)  The other issue was with room service - it was basically non-existent!  When we arrived our son took a Sprite out of the honor bar.  The Sprite was bad (basically was water, mistake from the bottler).  This obviously was not the fault of the Venetian, however, I called room service twice to have another bottle brought up (it was the only one in the fridge); no one ever showed.  On the second day of our stay we ordered breakfast in our room.  After an hour, I called and was told the kitchen was backlogged. 20 minutes later, breakfast finally arrived.  

Ok - I understand that Las Vegas is struggling with the economy, however, I would think that a high end property like the Venetian would be going out of their way to please the customers that actually show up. 

In the past 2 years, we traveled to LV 3 times, once at the Mandalay Bay; and once at the Aria.  Cost of these hotels were roughly the same; Mandalay was great, and even the Aria was better (it was having some startup jitters, electric drapes didn't work in the room, etc.) than the Venetian.

The Venetian had its day - guess they are trying to ride on their past reputation - unfortunately they are on a major downhill slide.
