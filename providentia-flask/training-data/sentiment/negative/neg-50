Arrived midweek at 12:30pm.... The fact that the pplace was deserted should have been warning enough, but we had faith in the Yelp reviews and the sticker on the door from Yelp & advertising the best carne asada this side of the border. The carne asada burrito was mostly tasteless, and certainly NOT worth the $8 I was charged for it. Drink choices are limited to bottled Mexican sodas & lemonade or iced tea. Complimentary chips and salsas, on the surface, are a nice add, but the store bought corn chips were stale & the salsas not very good at all.
I think that "this side of the border" refers to the border between them & the closest Filibertos. Honestly, I have had much better carne asada burritos from Ralphs Rolling Snack Bar & Filibertos, for much less money. I would almost bet that the Coco's in the same plaza could serve up better carne asada.
The one redeeming factor was that my friend said his fish taco was very good... Otherwise, I would grant zero stars.
