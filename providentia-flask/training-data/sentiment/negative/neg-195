So I'm giving this place a low rating for a few reasons. It was huge and had a great outdoor patio space but their was no music outside and in order to get the tunes playing inside you had to pay for them. When no one picked a song it was silent in there which was super lame. 

On top of that our bartender was the worst. He would not take our order of shots because we were unsure of how many we wanted so he made my friend write down what he wanted and how many on a napkin. How f'ing rude. I tried to order a grape bomb shot but he ignored me and wouldn't take my order. He literally wouldn't make eye contact with me. He was only making one kind of shot. Terrible service. It won't last and I won't be back. I'm not usually such a hater but this place sucked.
