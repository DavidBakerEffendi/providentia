We went here and had the worst service you could imagine. When we ordered bread and olive oil, we waited 20 minutes and only got bread. she never brought the olive oil and threw the pepper down on the table. The waitress could care less about anything . When we talked about the slow response form her to the manager, he wouldn't let me finish and told me how I'm wrong. When my friend steps in the manager started to argue with him. Are you kidding. You won't even listen. Worst service and manger ever. I can't believe how they treat people. Lastly, the waitress tried to charge us double for the bottle of wine we ordered.
