I wish I could give 0 star.. because I ordered 4 items and I didn't like a single dish. The foods were very average, typical Chinese taste. Loads of oil... no flavour.
In the chicken noodle, there's no chicken at all. Probably I found 3/4piececs on the top that's all!
I was served with regular menu. After ordering every thing, when I said I didn't like any of them; the waiter gave me the lunch special menu! Shouldn't they offer lunch special menu when people come? So weird and irritating.
