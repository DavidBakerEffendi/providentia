**Summary**
       - Gaming the System? - When most of your 5 star reviews are from people with barely any reviews, you can bet that the owner of this restaurant has friends. On the other hand, all the low star reviews are from people with lots of reviews.
       - Decor - There's an unfinished industrial look to this with interesting paintings on the side and unique decoration. It's definitely interesting.
       - Seating - The metal/wood benches they have for tables loss their appeal when you realize they're uncomfortable and you have no back support throughout your entire meal. Made me feel like cheap cafeteria seats again.
       - Price hike - Looking at a menu from last July, I realize that they really upped their prices while bringing down their portion and quality. That's one way of increasing revenue.
       - Tip - When you run your card through those ipad card readers, they usually give you 3 preset %'s and a custom. Those are usually 15%, 18%, and 20%. This place however had the options 20%, 23%, and 25%. Really? You rip off your customers and then expect a 25% tip? This isn't the Eiffel tower restaurant. I didn't see my napkin folded on my seat when I came back from the restroom.
       - Fuku Burger - After spending almost $50 at leaving hungry, we went to FUKU burger in the same shopping plaza. That's how small their portions are.
**Ordered**
       - $10.88 Stir Fried Udon - Bland udon fried in bacon and garlic. Portion size was tiny and it wasn't very special at all.
       - $3.88 Chicken Heart Yakitori - 2 skewers of 3 small pieces that didn't taste very good.
       - $4.88 Chicken Skin Yakitori - Out of everything, this restaurant's one silver lining was the chicken skin skewers. The crispiness of the chicken skin was very good.
       - Yelp Check-in Chicken Yakitori - 3 of the most dry skewers I've had in a while.
       - $20.88 Grilled Lamb - When you pay 20 bucks for 4 tiny rack of lamb riblets, you begin to wonder to yourself if you should of read the reviews of this place before coming here or just see that it was 4.5 stars. Let me tell you, I won't be making that mistake again.
**Recommendations**
       - I would never recommend this place. It has Gordon Ramsey Steak prices with tapas portions and barely above par taste.
