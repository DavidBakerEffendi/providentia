Food: 2.5/5
The food was mediocre, the portion is small.  Typical Americanized Japanese food.  Sorry, the tuna natto was below standard in Japan. 

Service: -5/5

The waitress was rude!!! My friend walked in before I did, she said the first thing the waitress asked her was if she was going to use groupon?   The wait staff immediately removed the special menu and the happy hour menu.  

Towards the end of the meal, the waitress came and claimed to clean the table until I noticed that she was touching my wallet!?  WHAT THE #@!@|||....!!!!!???

When confronted, although her mouth sound out she was sorry, but her demeanor said otherwise. 

Management: -3/5

Anyone who runs a successful restaurant will tell you that they need to be fully stock before Friday ( because of the weekend crowds).  

We attempted to order soda.  Sorry, no fuzzy drink on a Friday afternoon at 1:30pm!?  This only reflected 2 possible scenario:
  1. Lack of training on staff.
  2. Lack of inventory experiences.
Either way, both reflected badly on management.  To allow a rude waitress in staff and lack of inventory before catching the weekend wave.   

Final thought:
It would take a lot of convincing for me to come back here.  There are plenty of good food out there with great service in Vegas.
