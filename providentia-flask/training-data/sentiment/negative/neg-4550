The dining room has a smell that can only compare to a construction site portable outhouse. The lack of skill required to work at this fine establishment is amazing. The cook can not figure out sausage should be a part of a breakfast sandwich that has sausage on it. The cashier was what I believe to be a supervisor or manager, who was surprisingly slow, and could barely function. The other employee, was very angry at herself, I believe she even head butted the wall. I would steer clear of at all possible, unless you like torment and anguish.
