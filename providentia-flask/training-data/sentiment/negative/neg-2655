I was going to be a first-time customer but looks like I'll never be a customer at all. I had a family emergency and I had to leave town and I purchased a Groupon for the $40 for the $25 purchased. My coupon literally expires the day that I fly back in to town. I was told by one of the assistant managers to ask for Doug the general manager because he's very good at approving coupons especially for brand new customers and upon calling them today the inflection in his voice and the way he handled the phone call was very arrogant and very careless and did not seem to care that I would not only lose money on my coupon but also the fact that I was a new customer and would rather argue then make an exception even after I was told he is good at these things and has no issues whatsoever but apparently he does not care about customers especially new ones. I always thought the customer was right but I guess I thought wrong. As long as Doug is managing Battista's Hole in the Wall, I will never evem consider to patron and I'll be sure to let other people know just the same. Such a shame!
