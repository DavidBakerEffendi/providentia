Awful. Service was bad. The food was bad.
It took so long to get service. He finally came so we ordered. It took forever to get our food. And then once the server brought our food he never came back. We tried flagging other servers down but they didn't pay any attention. 
I asked for over easy eggs and got over her eggs that I couldn't even cut. Sent them back and they brought some more that were the same way. The iced coffee was like flavored milk. 
We talked to management and they didn't seem care. All we received was a cold apology. I guess I would be upset too if I was a manager bussing tables. 
Won't be going here again.
