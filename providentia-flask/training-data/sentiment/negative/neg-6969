I went here today with my boyfriend and would have liked to have tasted the food if it didn't take an hour to get to some service!!! 

They seem to not care about customer service what-so-ever!

Someone needs to tell the manager a thing or two about how to please the paying customer and be more selective in the hiring process of his idiotic waitresses!!

Got up and left before ordering food.

Won't return or recommend to anyone.
