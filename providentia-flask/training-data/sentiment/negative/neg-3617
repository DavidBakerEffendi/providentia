I have been to other paramount locations and enjoyed it; however , we decided to have paramount at Yorkville yesterday was a big mistake. We were very disappointed about everything : the service and the food. The service was very slow despite the restaurant was not that full when we went on a Thursday night. We got seated right away and ordered our food within a few minutes . We ordered a wrap and a salad with shawarma plate, simple stuff and should be fairly fast to prepare . We waited for 30-40 mins and I finally got the waiter's attention and was going to ask him about the status of our order. He asked me if we are ready to order ... No, well you took our order 30 mins ago , so yeah, they totally forgot about the order. We wait for another 5-10 mins for the food. The food finally came and I was very disappointed at the potion , to add shawarma on the salad costs $4.99 but it was only a few small piece of shawarma chicken on it. The portion of the salad was very little, not worth that much at all. I normally don't leave a bad review but I was really disappointed with this place. I don't think I would not go back or recommend it . :(
