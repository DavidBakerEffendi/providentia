Management: if you think Monday is slow day, you decide to be under staff. You will only jeopardize your business and staff. 

I have waited for at least 20 minutes to place the order. After a quick acknowledge from your staff and he decided to serve other customers who asked for service after me. 

so I don't think you deserve my visit again given the food quality went down hill, price went up and portion reduced and now the service is so bad.
