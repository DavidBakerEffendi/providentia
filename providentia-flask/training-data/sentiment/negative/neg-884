I don't know what Frommers was thinking when they rated this place a *find* -  I think it should have stayed lost.

Ross and I have been trying to eat there for three years.  Every time we tried to stop in we discovered a wait list of an hour and a crowded patio of waiting (read: drunk on margaritas) patrons.  

One night our timing was perfect and we got in with a 5 minute wait. I can't imagine what all the hooplah is about that place.  I can only speculate that the folks who are waiting an hour to get a table are so drunk that their tastebuds are numb when they finally get to eat.

I was very underwhelmed. So much so that I don't even want to spend the energy describing what I got to eat (tamales).  What's worse is that I didn't even like the chips in salsa.  Now that's pathetic.

Native and tourists - stay away.
