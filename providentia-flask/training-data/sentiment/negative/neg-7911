I have had better seafood at an all you can eat Chinese buffet..  The Lobster tails were the size of jumbo shrimp, the crab legs were old and nasty, I don't think it was worth the price( $125 with tip) for 2..  I came here about 10yrs ago and it was good, but  its gone down hill... I would rather add an extra $35 and go to The Steakhouse at Circus Circus.
