I have spent a lot of money in the uptown location and the Ballantyne location.  We would often have several people go to the one uptown and get pizzas and beer before a game.  When they opened the Ballantyne location, I began patronizing that one as well.  They had a good deal on Mondays for a large cheese pizza and garlic knots that we often ordered.  I called to order it this week with toppings added as usual and they told me the special was just for cheese; if I wanted any additional toppings I would have to pay full price for the pizza.  I explained to them that we ordered this often, and they said the owner changed it to this.  Besides the fact that any other pizza place lets you add toppings to a special for the price of the toppings, I do not want to support a business that is that cheap.  It makes me wonder where else they may be trying to cut corners, and based on previous reviews of poor customer service, they may not be doing too well.  Sorry, Libretto's.  You lost a loyal customer who turned many others onto your pizza.  I'd rather support a franchise than this business now.  My pizza dollars will be spent elsewhere.
