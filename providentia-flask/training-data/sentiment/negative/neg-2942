One star mostly because I spent some time unblissfully on the toilet in the aftermath.  Ugh.  Seriously, don't come here.  Your tummy will thank you.  There are so many options around the area, this Cantonese cafe style eatery simply isn't worth it.  

We had the crispy chicken with pepper sauce on rice and the Portuguese baked chicken, both of which are on their 'special menu' which pretty much means that you also get a non-special drink - lemon tea, coffee, milk tea, etc Don't let the drink suck you in to the special menu because the a la carte items can be cheaper, look more appetizing and sometimes also comes with vegetables.  Neither of our dishes which were $5.99 each came with a shred of greenery.  The veggie dishes on the printed menus start at $6.99 for the green beans and up to $9.99 for other veggies.  We cheaped out on the veg because the whole point for us trying this place was for cheap meal.  The chicken on both dishes seemed like the same chicken, just drenched with a different sauce.

The service was OK, though I didn't appreciate how loud the tv volume was turned up for Wayne's aforementioned Chinese show.  Parking can be a titzy in this plaza due to the small parking lot and numerous eateries.  There is an underground parking lot that closes at 9:45pm. 

For the tummy ache, the icky food and everything else... go somewhere else!
