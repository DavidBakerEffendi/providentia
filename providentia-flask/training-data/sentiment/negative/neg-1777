To be honest this should probably be a two star. However after sitting there for 20 minutes at a table with my three-year-old not having even been brought a water I am furious. I have been to this location several times every time I have had terrible service this time however was the worst. After sitting there for so Long and my child asking for water I decided it was time to leave. Because of my hungry and thirsty child I did not have time to speak with a manager hopefully one reviews these comments. I love the pizza at humble pie  but I will not be going back
