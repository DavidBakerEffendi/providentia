My standards for frozen yogurt is high. Right around the corner is Golden Spoon, and a hop/skip/jump away is Yogurtology. For the best frozen treat ever, you can walk across the street to Sweet Republic.

When you compare, Mix n Lix looks kind of sad and pathetic.

I popped in after a sandwich session at Quizno's, and I was disappointed. The woman working at the counter didn't really know much about the product, but to her credit, she was friendly, and didn't cop an attitude. 

The store itself is small, and I was let down by the lack of flavor options. The topping bar is a bit bizarre. It's split up on two sides of the store. It just made everything...uncomfortable.

Lastly, I was a little creeped out by the Disney Channel videos on the TV. There were no kids in here, nor were there any kids working here. 

You are better off going elsewhere. Go to Golden Spoon. Who cares if you can't swirl it yourself? At least the product and store is better.
