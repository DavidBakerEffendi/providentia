My family and I have been eating here since the restaurant opened and have enjoyed the food. We hail from New York and felt at home here, even meeting weekly to catch up. But last week after my aunt ordered a cup of matzo ball soup with the matzo ball on the side we had a serious problem. When the soup was brought to us, the cup of soup was half full. We asked for more soup. We, after all, were paying $1 extra to have the matzo ball on the side.  We were told it was a measured amount....that's how they do it. Except it's not and we know because like I said, we've been regulars for YEARS. We asked for the manager who, instead of offering more soup, tried to justify the half cup of broth. So, it would seem that a few cents of broth was worth losing regular customers who have been loyal for almost 2 decades. All we wanted was a cup of soup! They were unwilling to budge and have lost our business.
