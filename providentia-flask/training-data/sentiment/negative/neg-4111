Decided to eat out on a nice Sunday evening. What can be better than an outdoor patio? Well, as it turns out - many things can be better than this one. It is not clean. Not even remotely clean. There were tables that sat with dirty dishes for quite some time after patrons left, one table had a napkin on the floor just next to it - none of the servers noticed it even when next guests were sat at the very same table. Floors are not swept, well, maybe once a week, but clearly it's not enough. Our server clearly tried to do her best, however with majority of guest seated outside and lack of servers I don't think she really stood a chance. Food: our appetizers were okay, however the mains were sub par. 
This place is probably ok for a quick lunch, when your choices are limited, but if you want to enjoy some great food in a nice and relaxing atmosphere - this is not it.
