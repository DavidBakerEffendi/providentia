Bad hard seats! Shared table? (why are all the coffee shops in Toronto  the exact copy of each other, I don't want to sit at a big shared table, slash study hall) I want a comfy seat for my expensive beverage lol!
Sat at the only free seat, (shared table) for a person to sit directly opposite me, and shout into her laptop (Skype)...
over priced, mediocre coffee!
This place - Not for me
