WOWWWW lol Thai express more like let me express my DISSATISFACTION. Have u ever ordered soup and like expected more than a bowl old hot water with a single bean sprout and one ultra thin condom worth of a slice of beef? If so, don't go here, cause that's me being generous in my description. I literally had a sip of my soup and thought "wow, I must have forgot to put my tea bag in my tea" thinking it was just boiled water. The guy I ordered from was working alone and looked like he hadn't slept in weeks. Also, there was like two sauces available both half empty bottles that looked like they'd been left out in the sun for weeks.
