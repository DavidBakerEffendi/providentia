Today was an unnessarily horrible experience.   "Late" for brunch at 11 on Sun.  No 1.99 mimosas...although has 1.99 sign.
Ordered mimosa and a hot coffee w Baileys..
$20!  For a $7 mimosa & coffee drink?
And waitress couldnt even explain why it was $20..."oh i dont know how much they are, its all computerized. "
Seriously!?
