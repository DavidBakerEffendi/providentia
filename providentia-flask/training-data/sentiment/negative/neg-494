What can I say ? Waited 45 mins for nothing. Walked in here expecting to try the restaurant week menu and was told it wasn't offered. On the website it did not show any restrictions. The server only told me that they didn't do it and didn't explain why. So went ahead and tried the regular menu. Ordered the Coco French Toast and it was the most dry French toast we had in our life that we had to down it down with water. Breakfast sandwich we ordered was bland and had no flavor. The only thing that was somewhat decent was the monkey bread. I wasted my time here and should had just went to Kitchen Table.
