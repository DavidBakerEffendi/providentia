Come here on a Sunday morning with another couple and our kids. 
The hostess staff aren't very organized. They don't take names at open, so everyone just stands around. When it gets close to opening, then the hostess staff ask you to form two lines - one to get into the store and one for food. Why not just line up from when people start showing up and the hostess is there anyway.

When the lines started forming everyone just rushes and obviously people don't get in line according to who was first.

Anyway, we waited our turn cause many couples budded us. When it was our turn the hostess told us there would be a 10 min wait to be seated and asked for our phone number (this is when only about 4-5 tables were seated) I asked the hostess why we had to wait when there were tons of staff and lots of tables available. The hostess told me they didn't want to overload the kitchen with orders. I asked the server if we could just sit down because we have two young children and it would be great just to sit - but the hostess said no. I even said we wouldn't order until they were ready and she still said no. So I got pissed off and asked for a manager. Another more senior hostess come over and asked what the problem is. I said I simply just want to sit - there doesn't seem to be a shortage of staff or tables. We won't order anything . Finally this hostess said it's not a problem.

Amy was our server and she was great, but the hostess staff need to learn to run a restaurant. Who asks people to wait when you have staff to wait on tables and tons of tables.

Worst service ever
