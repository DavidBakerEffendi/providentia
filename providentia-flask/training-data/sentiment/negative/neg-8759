I have ordered from this place for the last time. I have said this before, but hunger and convenience (it's less than a mile from me) have kept me coming back. I have been eating here since I moved in the neighborhood over 3 years ago.

I have never placed a to go order without a hassle or something being wrong or missing. Once, I phoned in an order and she told me it would be ready in 10. I got there at 15 minutes and waited an additional 25 MINUTES after I paid for my food. She said, "Sorry, we got our rush." I said, "Then you should've said it would be longer. You still make tickets in the order inwhich you receive them." (I've worked in restaurants for 6 years.)

There is a guy that works there, dark hair and dark eyes (possibly hispanic in background, but I'm not sure) who is ALWAYS rude and has a bad attitude. My husband and I ate in there one time (not a to go order) and he slammed our plates down in front of us when they were ready and walked off without a word...when my husband asked for an extra side of hot sauce, he ignored him.

This same gem of a worker, today, was rude to me when I came to pick up my order and REAKED of weed...which was awesome (not) given that I had my 6 month old baby in tow. And my order you might ask? The pita was fine but the side salad had MANY pieces of fully brown lettuce and the cucumbers and tomatoes were frozen. I wish I could upload the picture I took. This wasn't the first time this happened with my salad...they often pre-make the salads and store them in a cooler that is way too cold.

This place could be so amazing..there are things on the menu that are really good and if certain people are working the experience is decent. But far too many times have I dealt with this rude cashier, and had my order (which isn't always inexpensive!) be inedible. Too bad...
