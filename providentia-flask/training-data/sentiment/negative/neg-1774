I almost never rate something one star as I feel that if there's some redeeming quality, it should be factored. With that in mind, my visit today fully merited one star.

At the time of this review, the other two reviews posted are both negative and the experience is related to the drive through. I should've known better, as I have gone through this location's drive thru before and waited ages each time.

Today, I just wanted a coffee. I saw the somewhat long line, but thought (especially given that was raining) that maybe they could still keep things moving. WRONG! It is a location with two ordering stations. It shouldn't matter which one you choose , because surely they'll ensure that they alternate? Wrong again. After one car moved in my lane, they had three cars move ahead on the other side. As I was getting frustrated and waiting nearly 10 minutes without moving an inch, I finally came to the order station. I immediately chimed in fearing that I was going to be ignored, but I was asked to wait. Sure enough, the car on the other side pulls to their station 30 seconds later, and then gets to order ahead. I think that car came a full 10 minutes after me and still got through ahead.

In all, I waited nearly 25 minutes for a medium coffee. In hindsight, I was foolish to have gone in the drive thru in the first place, but it was only about 8 cars ahead of me when I first arrived, which should've have been that bad.

From my experiences, and the other reviews here, there are clearly systematic problems here and this wasn't a one off. Terribly run, and perhaps corporate should step in and whip them into shape. Back in the day I worked at BK and we posted the clock with the wait time. Too bad they didn't have one here to show some accountability and measure their ineptitude.

If by any chance someone at McDonald's is reading this and think I'm exaggerating, please feel free to review your camera of the drive thru around 2:30pm on May 21st.
