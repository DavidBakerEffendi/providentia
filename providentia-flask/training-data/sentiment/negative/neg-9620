Went there to lunch on Dec 30. Expecting to get decent Chow Fun and good congees. After ordered, was told later Chow Fun had not been delivered yet, even at lunch time. Congees were bad. Overall, food is lousy and expensive. 15% tips was automatically added to the bill, even with only 3 persons and really poor service. Will not go again.
