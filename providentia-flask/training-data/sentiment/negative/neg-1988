when someone talks about or thinks about the Bellagio you automatically think high end and super high quality.. 

Apparently it's become a trend to not have someone actually wait on you at buffets in Vegas.. I know the food is self service but now drinks as well? Why is this a thing?  Maybe at some el cheap $8 buffet somewhere downtown?
Paying $30 for a lunch buffet (and paying for parking) that someone doesn't bring me drinks it's beyond ridiculous and they're suppose to help clear plates, which they still do, however they seriously lack the diligence to do so.. 

The food was good but not amazing like it use to be. The breakfast stuff was great, the bbq beef brisket, melt in your mouth tender but absolutely no flavor.. slathering BBQ sauce on a ridiculously tender brisket isn't going to give it enough flavor, it was so bland. The sliders? Why are these even on the buffet? HOCKEY PUCKS..flavorless bone dry hockey pucks.. I did not eat any Asian cuisine but one person in my group did and I was told it was dry and lacked flavor.. there is a ton of selection on this buffet and many gluten free options, 

desert was good, macadamia cookies were delicious 
.. 

I don't want to come to this buffet any time soon, I'm so disappointed, Bellagio is better than this..
