EDIT: The sushi gave me food poisoning so I'm knocking off a couple stars. 

Came here twice - once for brunch and once for dinner. We got free passes by playing My Vegas so we got to avoid the kinda pricey fee of thirty some dollars per person. The hostesses and waiters are all very attentive, friendly, and speedy. Never had any wait at any of the buffet stations, either. Unfortunately, the food can be extremely hit or miss. The pizza and carving sections are both highlights for me. However, the Asian foods were mostly disappointing, and the desserts were pretty standard. Unlimited beer and wine, though. If you can get a discounted or free pass, go check this place out. Otherwise, I wouldn't say it's worth the price of admission.
