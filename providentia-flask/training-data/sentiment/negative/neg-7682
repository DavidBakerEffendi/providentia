The food can be good.  But very much like the service can be very hit or miss.  Came in today and only ordered a bowl of menudo and a side of beans.  I  was THE only customer in the place and it took over 25 minutes to get my soup.  The beans didn't make it to the table.  No explanation,  apology, or anything.  By the time the bowl got to the table it may have had about 1/2 cup of menudo in it for $7.99 (note the size of the spoon next to the little bowl in my photo).   I  have been here for menudo in the past and the bowl was 2 or 3 times bigger.  The kid behind the counter said "well maybe I could reduce the price for you".  All I wanted was enough soup for a meal.  I could see the 2 cooks in the back just having a great time conversing without a care in the world.  The kid behind the counter seemed to be most interested in finding something on the TV that he was interested in watching.  Needless to say, I just walked out.
