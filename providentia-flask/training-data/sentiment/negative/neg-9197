I used to love this restaurant, I would take my daughter there at least 2 times a month.
I decided to get takeout and 4 times in a row there were items missing from my order. 
Not silverware or bread but lobster tails were missing with my filet order...whole appetizers, side items. When you spend 80 to 100.00 on takeout  food I expect my order to be correct. When I mentioned to the takeout staff what was missing, it seemed like an inconvenience to make my order correct. Shame on Outback! Never did a manager come out to apologize and while they were fixing their mistakes, the rest of my food got cold.
My advise...check your orders before you drive off!!!
