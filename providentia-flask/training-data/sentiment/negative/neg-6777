Such a horrible experience. The place changed their management, and it's all about profit, not about quality. 

The food is crap. They pack on the rice to fill you up and use canned salmon for their spicy salmon sushi. Almost every single item has no taste, other than their fries (how can you screw that up?!) and ice cream (prepackaged). Miso soup is bland, house salad ... Wet lettuce! Fish is not fresh, 2 out of 3 people got sick. 

Oh yea, they automatically give themselves tip by charging your bill - there is no option to opt out.. Even with three people! For the average all-you-can eat sushi buffet price .. I'd highly recommend that you go elsewhere to have your meal.
