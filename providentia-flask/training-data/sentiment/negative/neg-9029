Was in town on tour and we like to try local black restaurants in different cities. This has been the worse so far. Best thing about my experience was the water and the music. Don't order the cheese sticks... they are not good at all... definitely purchased from Sam's freezer section (admitted by staff) which means it is imitation cheese in them. The wings were not good at all (probably were Tyson precooked) and came out cold. The grits for the shrimp n grits and fish and grits was cold also. So after letting the waitress know she took the plates back warmed them up. We didn't even finish our meals. The owner came up and apologize but only offered us free drinks which we declined. We suggested taking their value and applying to the bill (we had no problem paying something). But when the check came for the 4 of us... only 1 drink value had been applied ($12). We didn't even complain. We paid our $100+ tab and still left a tip on top of the 18% gratuity (for late night service ). But I can say we won't visit this establishment again when we tour to Charlotte in the future.
