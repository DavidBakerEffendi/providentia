Some of the worst Indian food in the city!...  Everything is extremely terrible!... when I mentioned to the owner that the roti's were hard, he said it's very difficult to maintain quality of rotis in Pittsburgh weather!.. how on earth is that a valid justification, I can never tell!...  best to avoid this place at all costs!... there is a perfectly fine place down the street serving edible food!!
