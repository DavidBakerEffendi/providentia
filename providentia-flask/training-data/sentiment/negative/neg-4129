Get a thrill out of finding foreign objects in your food?  Then Bol d'or is the place for you!  A few months ago my General Taos was "peppered" with small, sharp white fragments of plastic. Today, I found a strip of metal in my soupe aigre-piquant.  I wonder how many foreign objects I haven't found (i.e. I unwittingly ingested) while eating here. I won't be eating here again; it's simply too dangerous.
