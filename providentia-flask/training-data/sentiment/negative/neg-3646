Not what you'd expect from a dim sum place. I understand that the concept of this restaurant was to put a more modern twist on traditional dim sum, but it was so far off that I really couldn't convince myself to like it. 

Came in on a Sunday morning around 11ish and the place wasn't too packed, so I got seated immediately. The hostess was a sweet gal. After that, I was asked if I wanted water and when I said yes, they brought out a bottle and poured me a glass. I didn't think anything of it, but little did I know... That water was going to cost me $5.50. 

The menu didn't have many options, so don't expect any of your favorite dim sum dishes. Everything has its own twist, which is fine because I was looking to try something new anyway. 

The 3 dishes that I ordered were mediocre at best. The waiter suggested their Cheun Fun, so I ordered the shrimp and was not impressed. The Shiu Mai also wasn't very good. For 3 dishes, a mimosa and water.. My bill came out to $55 for one person, which is a bit excessive for dim sum that wasn't even satisfying, so I really recommend saving your money and going to a more authentic spot.
