This place is terrible!  They bring you in with their modern esthetic but the final outcome is, for lack of a better word, gross.  I ordered a noodle dish with ramen noods and sesame beef.  I received a huge bowl of food but it was basically noodles and a greasy sauce with tough pieces of beef.  I could not finish my meal because it was far too oily.  There are so many other GOOD options in the food court at Eaton's Centre.  AVOID.
