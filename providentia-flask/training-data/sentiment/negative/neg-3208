Just had Sunday brunch here. Don't do it!! We hav eaten here before, great Italian food fixed fresh. Brunch was the opposite. Payed 15.99 plus drink cost for pre-cooked scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage links. Pre-cooked French toast, waffles and chicken tenders along with breakfast casserole. The lunch items were macaroni with red sauce and soggy chicken parm. 
No salads, dessert was a dinner plate presentation of store bought cookies and cake rolls. The biscuits were canned and set out at room temperature. This establishment is capable of much better.

DO NOT EAT SUNDAY BRUNCH HERE!!
