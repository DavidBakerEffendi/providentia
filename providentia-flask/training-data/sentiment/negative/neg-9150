This place is absolutely terrible.

My mom is a bit of a health-nut and took me for lunch here one day and it was UNBELIEVABLE how bad this place fails on all levels. 

We walked in and the place was relatively empty, save for one table of two women sitting in the back of the restaurant. The waitress sat us down and left to get us menus...and five minutes rolled by. She asked us what we wanted to drink, left the table and another ten minutes rolled by while we waited for those. She came back and we placed our order...thirty minutes later the waitress returned with our food.

I understand that fresh food sometimes takes a long time to prepare, but this was outrageous because all we ordered was two burgers. If I remember correctly, Mom had a Vegan burger and I had a good old-fashioned beef burger. I'll go on the record right now as saying that this was one of the worst burgers I had ever had. I ordered a "Cajun Spicy Burger," but there was nothing spicy, nor flavorful about it. The menu stated that the burgers come up with blue corn chips and mango salsa, which they did....five blue corn chips and a dixie cup-size Mango Salsa, which was also not especially tasty. At $9.99, these burgers were overpriced...especially because they didn't even come closing to filling either of us up.

Long after we had already finished eating, the waitress came and took our plates, and after another wait, we received the check. Leaving this place was a DREAM.

I can only speculate that our bad service was the Elixir Cafe's way of punishing us for not ordering all veggie burgers or taking any shots of wheat grass. If I want a burger, I'll take my business to Bachi Burger, Sliding Thru......even McDonald's  before I come to this joint again.
