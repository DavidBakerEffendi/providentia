Second time visiting before I wrote this.

When we walked in, we saw a woman with black glasses an white ear plugs talking with a woman with long dreadlocks. We walked up to the counter, no greeting or anything, just carried in talking.

Was told to wait 10 minutes but given no menus, the restaurant wasn't that busy as it was lunch hour. We actually got seated in 5 though, that's good!

Sever asked us if we're ready, we ordered drinks, lunch specials and an appetiser sampler. He came back with drinks but asked for our food order again.

The food arrived, the soup was a small portion, but that was good, so you can try more! The salad looked good too. However, both times we visited, the service on the lunch special is very very slow. If you ask for the waiter for a soup, they seem really annoyed and bothered by it. Small portions are good, but of they don't want to bring more, then it defeats the point. We are not a large group, we wanted to try 2-3 each. The last time, and what prompted this review, was that the server asked if this is all we want in a rude tone and we asked for his assistance 3 times in 20 minutes when wanting re-fills and soup.

The first time we visited, they forgot the breadsticks twice and it took 25 minutes to get them. I don't believe the breadsticks are fresh, they are baked from pre-frozen dough and have a strange plain taste about them. 

Anyway, to conclude... Service 1/10, salad 7/10, soup 7/10, breadsticks 2/10, sampler 7/10. A restaurant is nothing without good service and has no legs to stand on. Therefore, I have to give one as I genuinely was very disappointed. We won't be back here but glad we gave it a second chance to confirm.
