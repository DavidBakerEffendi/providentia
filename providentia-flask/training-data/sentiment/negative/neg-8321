So we order food on GrubHub. I was looking for some food to be delivered because we didnt feel like going out. The delivery time stated 1hour. We waited for an hour and a half before we called to find out the status of the order. The phone rang and a voice picked up stating "This user has a voicemail that has not been set up." Meaning -- you wouldn't even be able to leave a message even if you wanted to, nevermind not being able to even contact them directly. We end up calling GrubHub to find out if they can contact them or if they have a different resolution for why we are still waiting. GrubHub returned our money and gave us a credit. We literally went to McDonald's down the road because we were so hungry. Not to mention, we were waiting to eat and then go to sleep.. 2 hours roll around and *knock knock. we've literally just finished our fast food - which took all of 6 minutes to go get and bring back - and there they are! Sure everything was hot. It was obvious they forgot or misplaced the order and then made it and sent it out.. No call or anything to let us know what happened.. 

Onto the food quality: Their crab puffs were gross - they literally had no flavor whatsoever. Their orange chicken was soggy and also flavorless. It's a good thing it was inadvertently free, because it was disgusting. The prices were a little up there for the quality of their food. There's a little chinese place down the road from my friend's condo and their food is amazing.. I'm literally craving other crab puffs to replace the taste of BS from last night. 

Not only will I never order anything from this place for delivery ever again. I won't ever set foot in this establishment because their customer service and their food was complete malarkey. 

This place is dead to me. Enjoy your 1 star review... it's deserving for a 0 star restaurant.
