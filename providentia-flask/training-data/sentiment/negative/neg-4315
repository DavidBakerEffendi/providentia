All I can say is ok, something is missing in each and everything I looked at ordering. The bread was just alright I had the everything. The corned beef was ok, the Swiss cheese was strong and over all it would have been better with cole slaw or sauerkraut but neither was offered. Hoping for better, pretty much your average chain sub shop
