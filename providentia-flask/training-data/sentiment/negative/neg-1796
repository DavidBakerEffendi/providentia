Terrible.  This place is always way too full, and the service is terrible.  The takeout portion food looks okay, but the servers don't use gloves or wash their hands. Aside from the wait, the tables are small, and the servers are inattentive.  We were without tea for a very long time.  The prices are decent, not too too expensive, but the food occasionally takes too long.  

The tables can't be clean.  The way they wipe them down is to pour the previous party's unfinished tea on the tables, and use the napkins on the table to wipe them.  I've been here many times (because people I'm with like it), and it doesn't get better.  I will never agree to come back again.

Oh.  They're cash-only.  I never carry cash.
