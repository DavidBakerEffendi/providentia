When we walked in for brunch on Saturday, our group of 7 was seated at a table right next to the bathroom hallway. The bathrooms smelled VERY strongly of sewer and urinal cleaner. We requested a move, and the hostess actually AGREED with us that it smelled bad...

When we moved, it took us a long time to have anyone come over to take our orders. My wine glass was chipped, and each of our mimosas came in different sized glasses leading us to wonder if we were drinking the same thing- or not. 
We ordered the ham, asparagus and gruyere crepes- which were awful. The ham was diced up very small, it just fell out of the crepe, and there was no filling inside the crepes- just on top- also SMOTHERED in sauce.
We also ordered the burger- which was really good. (not enough to redeem the restaurant). The only reason this review has 1 star is because of that burger.

The service was terrible. It was completely dead for a Saturday during a holiday weekend, and our server forgot our toppings for our burger (avocado, mustard, ketchup), and by the time she brought them over everything was cold. When it came time to pay our bill- our server had disappeared, and we were left with our plates in front of us (no one ever came to clear them). 

All in all- one of the worst restaurant experiences we have ever had. We were visiting from out of town (we are from Dallas), and our friends were bummed because they said it was like night and day- they had come to Eggstasy before with a MUCH different experience. Hopefully this review helps them to take a look at their food and their service.
