We used to be regulars but not anymore. This restaurant has the most disrespectful staff, more specifically manager, we have encountered. They told us the delivery would arrive in one hour. It arrived in TWO hours. When we called, instead of apologizing and explaining the ridiculous delay, the woman proceeded to yell at us and somehow blame us (very weird) for this delay and say that they don't even do delivery (we've always ordered delivery from them In the end we gave up and ate cereal at home, that is how upset and disappointed we were with the whole experience. We told her she lost longtime customers, she said "too bad it's on you" (again, not sure why). They don't deserve customers, they are incredibly rude and ungrateful, not to mention horrible ethic. She called us an hour later, we thought, to finally apologize, but no, to say the driver got a "ticket from police". 
I highly recommend you guys get your Thai fix elsewhere. They don't deserve the hype.
