Went here becuase my in-laws wanted to try it out. Not a big fan of Olive Garden but you can't go wrong with their food. 

We went on a weekend so it was busy. The table they sat us at, smelled so badly!!! I did not even want to put my purse down. The area smelled like throw up or smelly feet. This made my food experience not good. 

The place is just older and needs some renovations. Please change your carpets!
