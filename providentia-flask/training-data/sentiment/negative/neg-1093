If I could give no stars, I would. This location had literally the worst service with the waitress giving me attitude after I asked regarding a takeout order that was taking over 25 minutes. Not only that but since my food was out waiting on the counter it was cold and soggy. It was also flavourless and more expensive than the Dundas location. Will never be going back there. Save yourself the trouble/money and go to the location across from Eaton Centre. What a serious waste of time.
