A friend recommended we try this place while in vegas and since it's open 24 hr and was right in front of our hotel we gave it a try. 

It was a Monday night at 1:30am. The decor looked like Prince threw up all over the restaurant. Very cheesy n tacky not to mention old. We had 4 diff ppl ask if we wanted drinks. The hostess asked even before we could look at the menu. After we receive our drinks she tells us the credit card machine is broken and to pay w cash. Ummm probably shouldve told us that before. But good thing I had cash which I usually don't. 

Food: how can u mess up chicken fingers and a house salad? For the prices they were charging for cafeteria food i expected them to get something right. Besides taking forever to get our food. The lettuce in the salad was browning. And the ranch was running like it had been diluted with water. I don't know if u could call it a salad because it was just iceberg lettuce and croutons for 5.95. The chicken fingers were so hArd they felt like biting into a brick. And their BBQ sauce tasted like hotsauce and ketchup. 

I'm not digging the hooker attire of the staff either. I will most definitely stick to the restaurants at the hotels.
