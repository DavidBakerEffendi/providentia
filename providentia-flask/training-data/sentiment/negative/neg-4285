Tasty? Hardly. It was over-priced diner food swimming in grease. I had a burger that dripped so much fat the entire plate it came on looked as though I had just eaten a bowl of cereal, only instead of milk I used melted lard. I asked for a second napkin not quite convinced the first I had been given wasn't just single-ply toilet paper taken from the bathroom and was instructed to use the paper menu under my plate if I needed something else to wipe up with. Somewhat bothered by the glib nature of the remark, I resigned to try but unfortunately, the menu under the plate was already completely transparent indicating it had already absorbed its capacity of oil. By stark contrast to the burger, the pizzas were terribly dry, having been baked to death and then presumably left somewhere unattended for several hours allowed to leather like an old French-fry wedged between the dashboard and the windshield for an entire summer before being noticed. Not worth even half the asking price, already unreasonable for the miniature portions. 

The "food" is served by staff you have to remind multiple times that you've asked for a drink and still not received it (even after the food has come) or when you would like to pay the bill and leave.  Once I ordered delivery and nearly had to call the police the driver became so hostile and rude, offering insults and badgering me for a larger tip complaining about the cost of gas and having a family to feed in his homeland and that I should be able to afford to pay him more of a tip since I can afford the pizza. My girlfriend once told me they had to have security escort him off their office property when he got irate they wouldn't pay for the wrong order he was delivering. Avoid at all costs? Avoid even if free.
