I came to Dr. Mansoor when my previous dentist could not take care of me during an emergency. Smiles by Hanna is not cheap, but I was happy with their work initially.  The staff are all friendly which makes an office visit much more pleasant. Unfortunately the veneers I got talked into when I initially wanted crowns, had to be replaced by crowns.  I was then charged a "discount" to replace the veneers that kept falling out.  The final one was installed without showing it to me and I was asked to sign their letter of acceptance after it was installed.  The color on that last crown does not match and I am totally disgusted with the result.  I will not return to even try to have them fix it.  Better to cut and run.  Wish I had been a Yelp user before I went there.
