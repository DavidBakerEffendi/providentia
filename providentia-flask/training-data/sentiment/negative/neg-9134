Lumberjack's Restaurant... don't even bother! I can't urge you enough to stay away from here. Slow wait-staff wearing filthy uniforms. Filthy floor, filthy tables and seating. Tasteless food delived at a snail's pace. I-could-give-a-shit attitude as thick as their mindless skulls. Oohhhh, and the "salad bar"... lettuce AND carrots AND cucumbers. No!! Really, it's just too much! You're better off just throwing your money in the gutter.
