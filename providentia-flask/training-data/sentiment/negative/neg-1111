I've been to wok of fame before a few times and have always loved it but this time not so much. 

Everything was fine I went with a few friends for a friends birthday. So the person that has a birthday eats free. Well it's always nice to get something free on your birthday. 

Anyways. We where eating we had not been there a half hour and they tell us they where closing at 3. Well nobody told us that. If that was the case we would have came back at 5. 

Then one waitress came over to me and told me when people eat there that there's a 2 hour limit. It's a all you can eat place. I'm not saying that people are going to keep running up getting plate after plate but people go there to relax and have a good time. 

The way they where today has put a bad taste in my mouth about wok of fame. I will be honest I'm not sure I will be going back. 

It's to bad because I really liked the place.
