So I had lunch with a friend at 1145.  I had 1/2 sandwich and salad. I had the chicken club. It had an oddly sweet sour taste and I quit after 1 bite.  I ate the frys and the wedge salad so I was good.  Didn't send it back or complain cause I am not really a complainer.  A few hours later I was sick, throwing up no fever.  I don't know for sure, but I'm guessing it was the bad chicken.  Not going there again.
