I eat here a lot and progressively the service and quality had gotten worse.

First, they would skimp on their mushrooms when ordering a cheese steak...then why charge for it!

Anyway, ordered at 12:44 pm a small sub with mushrooms. Had to ask about my order at 1:20 pm...guess what it was just sitting there supposedly.

Then you guessed it no mushrooms. C'mon people...and they aren't even that busy.

Avoid and go to a different location if possible.
