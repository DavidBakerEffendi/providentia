awful service. came here for a friends birthday. the food took ages to arrive, and when we asked for a separate entree of rice, we received an unseasoned poorly cooked rice. instead of a salad we got a plate of vegetables. lastly they took my friend's bouquet to the back, and never even reminded her to take it. the waitress was also rude and unfriendly. food was nothing special (mainly store bought fermented vegetables). would not recommend to come here.
