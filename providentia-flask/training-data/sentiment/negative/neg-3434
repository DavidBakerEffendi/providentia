I usually don't write bad reviews. We stayed at the Clarendon so we had breakfast here one day. It wasn't very crowded and they said they could accommodate my allergies and celiac. But there wasn't anything on the menu I could eat.

In situations like that, I usually will just ask for a hard boiled egg or an omelette made in a separate pan and this has never been an issue in my life. But here, they only make hard boiled eggs at lunch. And they only make omelettes on the weekend. And they only have good customer service on days that don't end in 'y'. According to our waiter, they stick to "basic egg cooking methods." 

So I got poached eggs that tasted like vinegar. I didn't finish them. My husband is not a picky eater at all and he said his meal was soggy and bad. The service was pretty bad .... We asked for refills on tea and they never came .... Even though we had vouchers for free breakfast, we never went back.

(My husband did order dinner twice while at the pool and he said both meals were fine then. So I'm assuming there are different people working at night.)
