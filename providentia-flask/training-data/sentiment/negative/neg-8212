First time at this location and I have to say that I am completely flabbergasted. From the waitress directing us to sit by the cold window in an almost empty restaurant (1 other table) to leaving hungry and unsatisfied. I decided to order the fried chicken and waffles...It arrived with an overflow of what they call their syrup/gravy and chicken fingers, yup I said chicken fingers! Phil's restaurant claims to only use the freshest, finest ingredients but I can assure you none of that was happening. Not only did it take the waitress forever to comeback or get the attention of, did I already say it was near empty? But there were 2 other wait staff just hanging out, talking and laughing and looking over at us. Blows me away that servers expect a tip when they behave like this. Finally, our server came over and I pointed out to her that it appeared to be frozen chicken fingers from a box. The waitress confirmed that they were in fact frozen and from a box and that they don't prepare them in kitchen. Oh and by the way same with the waffles. I am not sure how any self respecting restaurant could have the audacity to charge almost $20 for this 'fresh from the freezer meal'. BTW the waitress confirmed all of the above and even went as far as to say that she has told the owners/managers! Asked if I could order something else...well that took almost another ten minutes just for her to grab me the menu. And, honestly at that point I had enough and left. 
Do yourself a favor and go to McDonald's...At least then you know what your getting.
