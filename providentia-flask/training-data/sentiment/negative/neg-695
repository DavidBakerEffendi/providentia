I cannot remember the last time I've had such terrible service and been in such a dirty restaurant. Had I nut been with a large group, I would have walked out. To begin, it took 45 minutes to receive a glass of water. It look 3 hours for dinner. Then to my horror, I visited the restroom. Disgusting!  The floor had obviously not been cleaned in a long time.
