room is about a decade dated and the presence of the mall never is quite left behind.

the food was way overpriced and way derivative of nobu.  both south american-japanese fusion, but nobu BLOWS THIS PLACE OUT OF THE WATER!

the food wasn't awful, but the server had an alternative suggestion for EVERY ITEM WE ORDERED.  annoying, especially when every alternative suggestion was an item among the most expensive items on an already overpriced menu.  he kept pushing these roasted mini-corns and said he'd take them off the bill if we didn't love them.  well  we didn't, and he didn't.

this place encapsulates every stupid thing about vegas restaurants.  great, server dude!  you upsold us on some items and promised some things that you didn't back up and padded our bill an extra $50!  good for you!  except instead of my usual 20 plus percent tip you get 14!  and i will never return to your hellhole of a ripoff of a monstrosity of an abortion of a restaurant!  suck on that, sushi samba!
