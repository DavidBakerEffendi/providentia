My previous review stated that I enjoyed their spring rolls, so I had my roommate order me some when she went to get take out for some noodles. She asked specifically for vegetarian options, and my spring rolls still came with pork. Nbd, but generally a server should advise the customer that meat comes in an item they're ordering when they are specifically asking for vegetarian. The issue comes in when they didn't seem all too happy about switching it out. In her noodles it was also paaaaaccckked with  tofu, which I also wouldn't normally complain about, but you could barely even see any noodles in comparison. When I went back to grab the proper rolls (which probably took a solid 10/15 min of waiting, even though I called ahead about the problem) , they ironically were also receiving a health walk, and got a B grade. Now I definitely will not be returning.
