I didn't even expect good food or service because i read yelp reviews before I walked in. But seriously? Pho burrito and thai seasoned french fries? Purple cabbage in my spring roll? They weren't even served with peanut sauce. I'm sorry but all the house sauces they have got to offer were disgusting. Mainly because I'm not used to the fish sauce smell but they tried to put too much in one.
