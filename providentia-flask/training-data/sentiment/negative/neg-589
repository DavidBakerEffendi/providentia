Unbelievably horrible service!! The food was good, the drinks were yummy but our wait person (Susan) ignored us most of the night, even turned and walked away when we called her for some service. There were six of us and it took forever to get our drinks! It took forever to get our order placed, there wasn't any salt or pepper on the table and we kept having to ask repeatedly for some. Plus the kitchen forgot to make one of the dinners! By the time it came every one else was finished eating! Won't go back!! If the owner(s) expect this restaurant to stay in business they had better take service seriously!! Otherwise, no one will be repeat customers and they'll be out of business within six months or less!! 

Update: The response from the owner/manager is so ridiculous! Apparently you bailed on your restaurant that evening as we asked for a manager and were told there was none available; that you had left! How convenient! When you say that our order of scallops was late; we were told that the kitchen forgot to make the order! So lies, from either you or your staff! How pathetic! When you say no one in our group knows anything about the restaurant business you are so mistaken! Two to three of us have either owned and or managed restaurants in the past! When you call someone immature for saying that your restaurant may go out of business if the problems are not fixed, you appear to be defensive and pretty damn clueless! Good luck!!
