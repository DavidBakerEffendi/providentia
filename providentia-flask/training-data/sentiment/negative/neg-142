Date night took a bad turn pretty quick when we decided on this place. 
I'd seen it a few times but never gave it a chance until today. 
There was some random guy outside asking for food, which the group before us decided to help. 
We decided to order the 16" three topping for $15.95 special. 

The cashier (tattooed rude guy named Chris I think) didn't welcome us or ask what we wanted he just stood at the register and stared. 

I said hello... No response. 

As I placed my order he said "there isn't a special for that price." 

I didnt understand what he meant because it's just what I read off of the menu, so I joked and said "well maybe it's special to me." 

He said "yeah, you can't just order one pizza, you have to order another for $5 to get that price."

I told him that the sign said that the 16" three topping was only $15.95, nothing else on or around it said I had to buy two pizzas. 

He said "I don't think the system will let me do that,  but, oh never mind, that will be $17."

Then he asked if it was for here or to go. 

My girl and I decided to take it to go.

I haven't even tried their pizza yet and I have a bad taste in my mouth. 

Maybe instead of acting like you don't want to be there you could act like a professional and treat your customers with the same respect you get from them.

Save your time and money,  go somewhere you will be appreciated.
It's this kind of rude service that ruins the neighborhood economy and makes it hard to support your local businesses.
