I got sick. Reaaaaalllllllyyyyy sick. 

Perhaps it was due to poor decision making in terms of what to put on the hotdog- fruit loops are perhaps too adventurous- but regardless, I'm not eating there again. 

The music is also eardrum splitting. Not in a cool rock concert way- but in an "I want to rip my ears off my head to make that piercing screech stop right this second" kind of way.... Not fun. No thank you.
