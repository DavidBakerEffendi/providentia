I need to share my unfortunate experience at Sparklings so everyone is aware.
I visited Sparklings for the first time on 4/26/18. I sat at the bar and ordered wine and a few vegetarian appetizers, one of which was spinach and cheese ravioli (I am a vegetarian). When the food was brought out, it all looked good and I was excited to try it. I had a bite of the ravioli and immediately thought that something was wrong and indeed it was. They had brought shrimp ravioli to a vegetarian! So this was my very 1st time ever having shrimp. Not only was I furious about the kitchen mistake, but I also got an allergic reaction a few minutes after that bite! There was no managers at the restaurant. However, the bartender was very attentive and sincerely concerned which I appreciated. He took care of the check. I left, bought some benadryl from the nearby store and called it a night. Luckily for the restaurant, the allergic reaction was not bad, otherwise I would have taken legal actions. I will never go back!

+some constructive criticism... the place looks very nice but the bathrooms are disgusting! The food and wine selection is good but the wine list doesn't have info about the region and year of the wines (which is essential for a wine list). And again, train the kitchen staff to take food orders and dietary restrictions seriously.
