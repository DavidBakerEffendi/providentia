Ugh. Where do I start to complain? 
The good: service was friendly. 
The bad: everything else. 
I ordered a #2 combo. 'Upgraded' to a large drink, which made it $12.95! Really?! Whatever. It's a mall food court, and I just spent $5 at Subway for a 6" sub(not a footlong) for my son. What I got was the feeling that I was ripped off. A steak-um on a stale hot dog bun, with some cheese wiz, and a handful of fries. On top of that, they only had generic ketchup for the fries. Hunt's is bad enough, but generic? C'mon man!! Luckily a neighboring  place had some Heinz that they gave me. Didn't matter though. Nothing could have helped this so-called food. STAY AWAY!!
