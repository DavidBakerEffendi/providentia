I have tried this location 3 times and it did not improve.  The cashier was rude & obviously did not want to be at work.  I ordered steak street tacos, got chicken.  When my husband started to tell the girl who brought them to our table, she turned around & walked off.  Honestly, the only part of the meal that was good were the chips & salsa.  I think it will have to be a three-strikes-you're-out with this location.
