The worst dining out experience in my whole entire life ever! We ordered 2 chilled dirty martinie's, it was served warm, we ordered stufed avocado, it was served so raw, so we couldn't cut with a steak knife.!!!. wth!! We ordered miso soup, it came out totally room temperature, we sent it back, they reheated, it came out the same!!! They reheated a 3rd time, it wasn't boiling, but it was ok. I got an Ahi with scallops. It was totally cold and arrugula was wilted. And tuna was so salty, my mouth was burning from the salt! Unfrikinbelieveable!!!!!!! 
The manager took care of the bill, that's a star for that.. Thank you,  but anyway night was ruined. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!
