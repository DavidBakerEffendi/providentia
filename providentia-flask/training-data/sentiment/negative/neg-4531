It's a food court location at the outlet mall for overpriced sandwich. I decided to stand in this long line and after getting to the cashier was I notified they ran out of steak. 

How do you run out of steak and a philly steak establishment. Why did they not announce it to the line. I did not want chicken since that was the only option. So, I left after wasting 20minutes of my life that I'll never get back and went hungry standing in another line at the food court. From what i saw other people were eating, the sandwiches did not even look that appetizing at all. I should have listened to the yelp reviews. Good luck if you're going to eat here!
