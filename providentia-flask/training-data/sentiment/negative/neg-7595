This is probably the worst Olive Garden experience i ever had. I been to there location many times already, and today I had the worst server ever. My server never come to my table to refill the sauce and my order were off. The server was talking to other table most of time, and she ignored our table multi times. We waited for over 20 minutes with empty water cups and wrong order. All my friend done eating their meal and my meal was just sitting  in the edge. Stayed hunger for over 30 mins and server never apologized for the bad service. I would never return back.
