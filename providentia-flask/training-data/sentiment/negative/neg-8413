I'm very shocked this restaurant has 4.5 stars!! I went to Roy's in Oahu, Hawaii with my boyfriend last summer and it was amazing!! Therefore, when deciding on a restaurant for New Years Eve with my boyfriend and parents, I thought Roy's would be an excellent option. Roy, was I wrong!! Upon arriving at our table, they told us it was a four course only option for that night. It would've been nice to know that when I booked the reservation four days in advance. Our party of four ended up sending 3 dishes back to the kitchen! I typically don't send dishes back because I don't want to be rude, but I had no choice in this instance. The kitchen is open to the restaurant floor and there were constantly managers inspecting each dish and personally delivering them to each table. That's why I am surprised that the food was not good at all. Great service, but this restaurant could greatly benefit from a menu and kitchen staff overhaul! It sucked because we paid for a pricey four course meal on NYE and left disappointed and unsatisfied. We would've been happy to pay the money for quality food, but that was just not the case. Pros: Coconut Frappe signature drink, Garlic Prawns appetizer, and service. Otherwise, do not waste your money.
