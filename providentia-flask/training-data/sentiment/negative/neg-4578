I came to this buffet last year in November. I had 2 buffet vouchers with the front of the line passes. This place was astounding, however, there was a hair in my meal. I told the manager about it and I was promised to be taken care of. They promised I will be given 2 vouchers for the next time I stop by. However, we left empty handed and the buffet was refunded because of the hair. They won't help me because I paid with cash and don't keep all my receipts!!! 
I would rate them negative, if I could.
