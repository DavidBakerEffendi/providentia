I'm actually surprised by the positive reviews listed below. It may be the owners friends he's a nice guy.

I really wanted to like this place as it gives a chill vibe but it just didn't do it for me. The interior design doesn't make you want to stay for too long. Behind the cash the area is cluttered and messy due to that I didn't feel comfortable eating from there because of it.

The lattes we ordered were not good. I am a bit of a coffee snob and appreciate good coffee, so seeing as I can make a better latte at home I won't be coming back.
