Crooked River BBQ + Beer :
 This is the worst place I have ever been too. The service and food at this location was terrible. 

* The person behind the register did not know the menu. I asked about a  few items on the menu and she did not know the answer. 
* The food took over 25 minutes to get to the table. The items that were delivered to the table were not correct. 
* Everything we ordered was not hot and did not have any flavor. The sauce at the tables were not even usable. They were all clogged with dried up food, very gross and not sanitary.
* Manager came to the table and asked how things were. I told the manager of my issues and she said " This is our first week open, and we are hoping to get through the growing pains". 

This was very disappointing, if I had a guest complain I would make it right. 

***I hope who every reads this understands that this place is not worth your time and money. **
