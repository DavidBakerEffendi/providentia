Meh... Not really liking it. I only came because my fiance likes this place but I don't like being in loud places that I can't even talk to him. My omelet rice tasted wayyyy too buttery that I haven't eaten even half. The sauce for the wings hit my gag reflex and the croquettes were a bit bland so I ended up eating only one. Thankfully we didn't have to spend too much cash. Sorry, I tried to like it but I don't feel so good now.
