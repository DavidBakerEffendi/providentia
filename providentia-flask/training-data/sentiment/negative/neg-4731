Came to see a band. Drove 1.5 hours. Our party of 6 could not be accommodated. Wait staff couldn't be bothered. I sat at a table with only three stools and hoped for seating to open.  There is a sizable patio with minimal table seating. Didn't get to see a menu or order a drink. Will not return. I don't expect much, just, you know, service.
