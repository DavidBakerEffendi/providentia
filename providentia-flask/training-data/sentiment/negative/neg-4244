The only thing that is good about this place is there 5 dollar medium pizza deal but i can understand now what they made 5 dollars and that is because the pizza there is horrible their pizza is so tough to eat because every time i eat their pizza it always hurts my jaw and don't get it mistaken this pizza was not a leftover pizza it was a Fresh pizza that i ate right away as soon as i got it so it confuses me in why it taste like im eating a pizza that has been sitting there over night.
