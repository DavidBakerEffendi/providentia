So disappointed with this place. We order lunch everyday and we decided to order from them today. Southwestern Chicken Salad had huge bones and no dressing at all. Black Bean Burger was dry and didn't have a side dish. Almond butter and jelly sandwich was dry and hard, sweet potato fries were totally burnt. Called them to let them know we had these issues and also took pics to show them. We were told we would get a full refund back, went there and out of $45 they gave us $21. Staff is rude and our company will never order from them again!!! $
