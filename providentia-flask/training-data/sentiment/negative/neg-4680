Ate here awhile ago and was kinda grossed out.  Got a gyro pita.  The highschool girl who made it opened the meat cooler drawer under the grill with her plastic food service gloves on, grabbed the meat for the grill, closed the fridge with her gloved hands, then proceeded to make my sandwich with the same pair of gloves.  Nasty.  The idea of gloves is not just to protect your hands from getting food on them as much as its to protect my food from getting contaminated with all the nastiness you touch in between making the food.  Gloves need to be changed between each customer, especially due to food allergies someone may have to something you just touched on that last customer's sandwich.  Management needs to get a handle on these things, you're lucky I don't work for the Health Department.  

The food was underwhelming, the pita meat was gross pre-formed strips in the shape of turkey bacon, barely tasted like what I know pita meat to taste like (I'm not Greek so Showmars is my benchmark here).  The pita bread was not soft enough and wasn't heated adequately.  If you have the word "Pita" in the name of the business at least get some good product to use in the gyro....that's the sandwich people think of when they see the word "pita".  

I've had Pita Pit at the location downtown Charlotte with better luck.  I hope this location gets things turned around because it's a nice concept and good alternative too all the greasy fast food chains on Independence Blvd.  The staff was friendly at least, so....1 star for that.
