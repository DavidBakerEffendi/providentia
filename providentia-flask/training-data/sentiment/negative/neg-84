I am actually quite shocked to see so many positive reviews of this place on here. I am visiting from NYC to see my folks here in Surprise and we decided to have dinner here tonight and was sorely disappointed with the quality and authenticity of the dishes. I ordered the one dish any self-respecting Vietnamese restaurant would never screw up: the combo pho. Not only is the price ludicrous for a bowl of sub-par pho but the dish itself was utterly disgusting. The broth lacked any flavor, the meat was tough and also quite flavorless as was the noodles. Not sure if the people on here just have never left Surprise and/or actually been to a real Vietnamese restaurant. This place would go out of business in half a second in any city with actual competition. I urge all of you who gave this place a good rating to visit a city like New York or better yet, any of the cities in Vietnam and then visit a real Vietnamese joint and then tell me if you still think this place deserves your patronage.
