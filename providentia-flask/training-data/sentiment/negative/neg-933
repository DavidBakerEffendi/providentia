Holy cow! This place will NEVER get my business ever again.  For 3 WEEKS IN A ROW....YES, 3 WEEKS, my 5 friends and I would come by during "Bike Night" (Thursdays). Each night,  we would go to SR fir eats.  

We walked out last night after waiting 30 minutes for initial service!  We asked for service, twice.  One of our friends got 5 beers from the bar and STILL no service!

Last week, it was the same thing.  After waiting 45 minutes, they finally got us some drinks....then another 30 minutes....then more drinks....it took us 45 minutes to get our food. WTF?

Same story week before that.what's going on?  It seems like they hire nothing but kids and no one ever asks how things are going. 

They have a great theme....but that's it.
