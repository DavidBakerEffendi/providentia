WORST MEXICAN RESTAURANT EVER-
Ok- Can somebody tell me how is it possible to go to a Mexican restaurant and have a BAD margarita!!!! Not to mention that our server said the menu was missing some items... SMH  Well it gets worse not only did I have a bad margarita I also received terrible service. I spoke with the manager &'shared that the restaurant changed ownership 4 1/2 years ago! WOW this explains A LOT! Save your time, money & gas.
