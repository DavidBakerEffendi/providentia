Sorry gang I generally hate writing poor reviews, but this one had it coming.

I came here after an Adventure Run.  I usually try to rush there to get early seating which I did.  Needless to say, I was one of about 2 other runners that made it.  So I thought I'm going to sit at a prime location....at the high tops on the aisle, but close enough to the bar.  As I sat and waiting; the servers didn't seem to give me any sort of nods or attention.  Not even a slight glance to acknowledge me.  

As I continued to sit and ate the chips and salsa pre-placed before the other runners came; I found myself thirsty, yet still no attention so I grabbed some water across the table from me.  As more and more people came in; guess whom got water, drinks and food first?  Not this guy, I continue to sit and wait...and the servers kept walking past me to serve other table; literally walking past me if I didn't exist!

You know that feeling when you sit at a restaurant and people that came after you get their food first;  yeah I got that feeling.  Its appalling and offensive, cause it's makes you feel mistreated and discriminated.  I literally timed myself as time past; 24 minutes later....nothing.  As a former restaurant server, host, cook, etc.  This should never happen.  I know all the tricks of the trade and one is never assume, always ask; have you ordered your drinks, are you waiting for someone, can I get you anything.....something!

In the end, I'm never attending this place again!  Thanks Blue Agave for the chips and salsa and water that I served myself.  Next time I want to be ignored or left along; I know just the place - Enjoy!
