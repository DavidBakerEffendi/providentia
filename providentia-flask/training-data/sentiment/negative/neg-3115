The food is ok but the staff Is what makes the experience. The problem is the owner!!! He is basically just not a very nice person. The way he treats his staff is demeaning, degrading and with absolutely zero respect. Doesn't matter if he is the owner. No one has the right to treat other people that way particularly in front of other people/customers (frequently done). Shows lack of character & business acumen. Do yourself a favor and avoid this drama ladend atmosphere. Doesn't make for a pleasant dining experience and the food really isn't that good.  Would have given a 0 if was an option.
