All you can eat sushi; more like what they feel like remembering and bringing you sushi. Terrible Service. They literally forgot half the items we ordered and while we were waiting for stuff they forgot we waited to order more. Before long it was last call and he was claiming we never ordered stuff we asked for 4-5 times. The quality is grocery store, the meat is fatty and the sushi? well.. it's grocery store.
