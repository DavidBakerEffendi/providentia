Walmart quality food. All fish was over cooked, dry and tasteless. Prime rib was chewy like rubber. Sushi, I had better sushi at Walmart. Fried rice was dry, and sushi rice was not cooked properly. Overall it's the worst buffet I've ever been to. I would not recommend this to anyone, especially considering how much you pay for this high school cafeteria grade food.
