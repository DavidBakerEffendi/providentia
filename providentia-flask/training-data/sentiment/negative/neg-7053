Waited for your promised time of 45 minutes. It's now been over an hour. I have a classroom full of students waiting who were affected by your company's delay and lack of compassion. 

Called to ask eta. They said if it wasn't here in 5 minutes, I should call back... I shouldn't have to keep checking on my order! 

Waited another 10 minutes, and called for a second time. Your cashier was not empathetic when dealing with this. She said "I really don't know what to tell you. Our drivers don't have gps."

The delay is not my main issue. It's the fact that every time I contacted you after waiting an hour on two pizzas, I was told to wait another ten minutes. And the driver still didn't show. I had to keep telling a room full of people "pizzas on its way" "no it's not, but it will be". 

45 minutes for two pepperoni pizzas was excessive. An hour and twenty minutes with no real answer on eta? Ridiculous. If Pizza Hut can estimate an accurate time, why can't you? 

I asked to speak to a manager on the phone to inform them of the phone operators lack of empathy. Waited 5 minutes and no on ever picked up. 


Way to run a business. I'm so embarrassed and will strongly think against using you for my
Corporate events again.
