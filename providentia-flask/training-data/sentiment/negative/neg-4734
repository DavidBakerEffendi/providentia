NEVER AGAIN...

I don't mind waiting 20mins for 3 burgers, I don't mind paying $38 for 3 burgers... 

But when they give my Togo order to another customer who opens the food box and reaches in and realizes it's the wrong burger they should have recooked that burger... they didn't and when I asked they said "it's fine he hardly touched it" 

That burger went to trash and I left. 

As a final insult I realized when I got to the park they didn't put any napkins in the bag. 

Great food but horrible service.
