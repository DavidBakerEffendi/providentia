It was my first time ordering from this panera and I will go out of my way to never order food from here again. 
First of all, I got a half Mediterranean veggie sandwich and I paid to add avocado. There was maybe an eight or an avocado on my sandwich. 
Secondly, I ordered a cup of autumn squash soup. They gave me a cup of chicken noodle. 
I'm livid because that soup was the primary reason I went to panera, and they gave me chicken noodle. 
Honestly this franchise has gone downhill. I don't know if I'll ever go to panera again after my recent poor experiences. 
Everyone: DONT go to this panera if you must go to a panera. I would recommend cafe zuppas, they've never had a wrong order for me and their food is better.
