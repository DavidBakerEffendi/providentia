I sat patiently for my food that I ordered online that stated would take 15 minutes, so i showed up at 15 minute marker. Sandwich hadn't even been started but I was still pleasant no worries. 10 mins later got my food took the apologies for the delay but said it was ok and left...all in all a good customer for the delay....get back to my office the specific NO CHEESE not and verbal comment it was the cheesesteak without the CHEESE was ignored...melted cheese...no way to eat around it...after being so nice about the delay you couldn't make sure my sandwich was correct? Got my money back will not be going back. RESTUARANTS PLEASE STOP MESSING UP ORDERS IT REALLY ISNT A HARD TASK TO COMPLETE YET HAPPENS SOOOO MANY TIMES
