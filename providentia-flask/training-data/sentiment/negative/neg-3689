If your planning on having a good meal this isn't the place.  If ur drunk and want to cus out people and sing along with the dj...come on down.  The fish and chips were soggy, the salmon tasted like chemicals, I've had better nachos at Taco Bell.  A $120 later for three people and I wondered what the hell did I just spend it on.  Over priced and low quality food.  Although the service was fuckin great!!
