I'm so upset to give this place a negative review but I was very disappointed with my experience at Kale. I've had multiple friends recommend this place to me & quite frankly I have no idea why. 

On a positive note the place seemed very clean & tidy. The atmosphere was like a fancy, high end fast food joint. Very bright & open. They have a menu & an open food bar where the food is priced by weight. I opted for the open food bar because the food looked delicious. I got a rice noodle seaweed dish, shepherds pie & the kale. I just picked up a snack container to tied me over till my lunch plans. I am so happy I didn't get more then that! First off that little bit of food came up to $8, secondly the food was pretty bad. The kale had no flavour, the shepherds pie had flavour but sadly it wasn't a very good one & the rice noodle seaweed dish was the same. I've eaten at oodles of places around the city that have gluten free, vegan food & everything single one was better then the meal here. Between the taste & the price I'd recommend going elsewhere. Plus the staff was not the friendliest.
