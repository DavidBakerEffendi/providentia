such a rude staff!!!! we were meeting a bunch of friends for drinks spent over a hundred dollars..then we stayed and ordered food.  they waited till our food came and we were eating, the female bartender was like you need to move now?  we were not at a machine but was next to one, nobody was waiting? she was so rude?  we will never come back!!! Kept telling us to move now?? For who I said...I'm not blocking a machine? Don't go.....not worth it...
