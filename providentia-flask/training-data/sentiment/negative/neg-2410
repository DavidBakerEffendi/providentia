Came here for lunch after shopping. I will never ever go to another T.G.I.Fridays. My server Marissa or Miranda would not serve me. The host Trent from the front that seated me had to serve me. I'm  sure this had to do with the color of my skin. To my put one star cause I needed it for this review. I guess I have to find another favorite restaurant.
