This was our second stay at Encore and between the 2 visits, we've eaten at over a half dozen restaurants in the Wynn and/or Encore.  This was the only disappointment!  What a shame because it has so much potential and there is no excuse for such a mediocre execution at such an establishment.  I had the alfredo with shrimp and it resembled and tasted like a tv dinner!  I could have had better at The Olive Garden!  It was smothered with sundried tomatoes and mushrooms and was just bad-period.  My bf had the Philly cheesesteak and that too was a disaster.  How can you mess up a hot sandwich?  Th only decent thing we had was the salad caprese, which was actually good.  What a waste of $ and the nice pool view!
