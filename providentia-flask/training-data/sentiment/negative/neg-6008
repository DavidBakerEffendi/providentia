Worst Tim Horton's I have ever visited. Staff is rude and inept at fixing an issue. Used the mobile app for a free coffee, they did not bother to get the order.  When approaching a staff member about this, the response was 'oh yeah I saw the order, I just didn't make it'.  It sat for over 10 minutes ignored.
Second issue again with the mobile app.  Placed an order and went to pick it up only to see the store was closed. Staff was leaving and they said it's not their problem I was charged for an order.  I would avoid this Tim Hortons which I'm sure the staff would like others to as well.  They won't have to 'work' then.
