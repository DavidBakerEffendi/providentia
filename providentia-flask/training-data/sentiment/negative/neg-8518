The first time I came here it was really good. I got a burger because that's what they're known for and it was delicious. Maybe being a little tipsy might have something to do with it.  My boyfriend hated the place. He hated the food and hated the server. She wasn't attentive at all. The wings were chewy,  which means they deep fried frozen wings. I tried to tell him he was being very critical.  
     The next time I went there, I was there with a friend and sans boyfriend. After a bit of drinking I decided it was time to go home. Earlier I convinced my boyfriend to give them another chance in the food department and picked us up some food to-go, burgers because they were so good. I live within walking distance from the place and when I got home, i noticed the burgers were practically raw. I called the bar and told them what happened, and they ask me to come back so they could replace my food. My boyfriend wanted no part of that, and wanted a refund for his food. After the bartender assured me that my food will be cooked properly I came in and picked up my replacement food. He was also good enough to refund me a couple of my drinks from earlie which made up for the hassle. That burger he cooked himself and it was good. He also took the lady who made my burger off the grill.
     Today I went there and picked up some food to go. The same lady who cooked my burger before, was working the grill. I didn't want to be a dick and ask for someone else to cook it and I decided to give her another chance. Before I left the bar, I checked my burger to make sure it was cooked all the way, and again it was raw. So I asked the server to have her cook it a little longer, and when I got home it was ok but then my fries were cold. All in all, it's a pain in the ass to try to get food cooked properly there. If you like rare hamburgers, this will be the place for you.
