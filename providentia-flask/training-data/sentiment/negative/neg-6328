This place is the worst!!!!  The only thing worth it is the homemade grisssini.  

The fettuccine Alfredo looked like it came from olive garden, very dull and bland.  I ordered the steak special and for $65 I received a steak that was ok, not great, barely ok and a blob of something they called garlic rosemary mashed potatoes.  No way, it had NO FLAVOR!!!!!

The creme brûlée was weepy and watery and the only good part was the wonderful  berries on top!!!  

Save your money, this place is not cheap and there are MANY other options you can choose from.  One worth pursuing is the steak place in NY NY......
