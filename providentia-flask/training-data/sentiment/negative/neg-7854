We were told 30 minutes for a table and gave our cell number for them to call. After 1 and 1/2 hours and no call we came back and were seated to an empty restaurant. Clams on half shell were ok. Entrees took 45 minutes and came out cold or luke warm at best. Had no flavor and over cooked. After the manager came over to speak with us he took off $30 to make us happy. Would have been fine until the bill came and our server added another 25 to my entree thinking we wouldn't notice. Had them redo the bill and would never go back. Food was not good but the service was worse. Save your time and money and go elsewhere.
