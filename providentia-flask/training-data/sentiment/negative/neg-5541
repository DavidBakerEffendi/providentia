Officially the WORST dining experience ever. My food came out wrong twice and in addition the first order of pancakes had a piece of plastic in them. I had no modifications to my order, but it didn't even come out like the menu description.  I ordered the banana pecan wheat pancakes with egg whites and two strips of turkey bacon. This is how the menu read. I got regular scrambled eggs, a piece of sausage, regular bacon, no bananas on the pancakes and the pancakes weren't wheat. The second set of pancakes (after the set with plastic) weren't wheat which I just dealt with and she acted out out by my asking for bananas.  She was rude and condescending. She gave us our check as soon as she dropped the food off and then after the pancake fiasco we asked for a new check as she said she would take care of some things. She dropped the second check and said they took off a few dollars for the inconvenience. The second check was exactly the same as the first. When confronted about this she said there was no one there that could discount it. She lied to us. This was a horrible experience and we will absolutely not be back.
