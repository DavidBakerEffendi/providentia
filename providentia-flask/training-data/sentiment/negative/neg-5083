For some reason I guess you have to give at least one star for the review, even though they don't deserve it. I've gone to this location every Thursday since I moved to the area, and I've been able to get A biscuit substitution because I don't do biscuits, on the their combos. But I went this evening, to get the same substitution that I normally do, and they told me they never do that. I explained to her I do it every Thursday, and she said sorry they don't. I left the drive-through and called the location to talk to the manager. The manager got on the phone and I explained my situation, and she says that they don't ever do that. I explained that I do it pretty much every Thursday and she pretty much called me a liar, saying that she instructs her crew to never do that. She was very rude, short with me in, and hung up on me. I will never go to this location again and I hope this gets around. I am a business owner, and if I had an employee with that attitude, she would no longer be an employee of mine.
