The only star is for the bomb ass michelada but in reality how can you mess up a beer with Clamato. Aside from our sour faced waitress which applies to all the waitresses here, the food was crap. Maybe bc I'm from OC and we have amazing Mexican food in every corner but I expected at least tolerable food. I ordered shrimp tacos which came 3 to an order and they were crispy so as soon as I took a bite I almost vomitted ! Who puts crumbled shrimp in tacos ?? Disgusting ! When I told the waitress that I expected whole shrimp in the tacos she said, oh no it's not. I have eaten in Nayarit, Mexico and know that they have the best mariscos but this was an abomination! Stay away !
