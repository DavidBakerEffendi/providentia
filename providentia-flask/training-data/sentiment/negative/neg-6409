The food here is to die for, but when you have a host/ess that's nowhere to be found, generally dismissive staff, and a noticeable distinction between how the POC patrons are treated, the company core values should probably be re-evaluated. As a Charlotte native I'm perturbed by businesses who take up space in our neighborhoods without any consideration for the actual people that live there. Do better.
