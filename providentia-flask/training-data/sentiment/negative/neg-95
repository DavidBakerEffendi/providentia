On vacation from out of town, we had no idea where to eat.. Someone recommended pizza from here. We called for delivery to where we are staying and they said they wouldn't deliver this far and to just go to the Miami diner. That should have been our first hint. We felt brave and drove to Angela's on a mission to get pizza. We arrived and ordered. 45 minutes passed and our waitress tells us there was a mix up and they didn't start making the pizza. WE WERE LITERALLY THE ONLY ONES THERE. To make matters worse, I got a parking ticket from parking right in front. I don't know French and don't know what sign I missed. I know I parallel parked behind a car and in front of another car. Guess everyone was illegally parked and they were all able to move in time. Maybe if my pizza didn't take an hour and if my bill/change came when I asked I wouldn't have this $60 parking ticket. Visiting montreal I've had the best smoked meat, bagels, and poutine in my entire life. I can't say the same about pizza. Will not return, but they don't care anyway. Never go somewhere that doesn't care for your business
