The waiter with curly hair was rude, had no smile and gave me attitude. It took him forever to get me a menu. Unfortunately, I work in the same business and I know that this place has a customer service problem. The place was not busy at all. The hostess should have brought us the menu as she sat us down. Madison on Sherbrooke was great but I don't recommend the one downtown.
