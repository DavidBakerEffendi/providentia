1 star is for their food. It's pretty good i'd say, but not worth for the service or attitude.

Came here in November, so this is a late post but my mom booked a reservation for 27 people after the wait staff ensured they could accommodate a family gathering for lunch. When we arrived the day of the reservation they gave us 2 tables telling us it would fit all of us. We mapped out the seats and it could fit 20 max (this is us being all cramped together). The staff was less than helpful, and had an abrasive attitude. Also, because we spoke to them in mandarin, they started talking about us in cantonese (I assume they didn't think we understood, until we started talking in cantonese to them too). I also overheard the wait staff talking to each other, and they were complaining about another customer from before and the response from one of them was "oh just tell them to eat sh*t." I honestly don't think you should yell this across a few tables when other customers are around. I get customers can be wrong at times and hard to deal with, but why would you say that when other customers are around? It just seems offensive.

Also, when we were ordering food, they seemed to run out of every other thing we wanted to order, and we were there at 12:30 for lunch...

Needless to say, after all the hassle and disrespectful wait staff experience, all my family members are set on never returning to this establishment. The food may be good, but the service and experience was horrendous.
