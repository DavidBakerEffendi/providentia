I had never heard of this place. We hit this place up for a buddies bday after one of his friends got us kicked out of Sandbar. The name sounded promising... A) Who doesn't love margaritas, and B) a modern hip place is usually fun. 

However, when we got there, we quickly found out why its in N. Scottsdale. The crowd is essentially a 45 year old and up early dinner crowd. 

The drinks: 
After all this a bar entitled with the word Margarita in it. So the Margs and premade, and the bartenders just pour them into glasses from a carafe. This has its positives and negatives. 

Positive: The drinks come out quick.. You order, she pours, done. 
Negative: No human element to it. If you request it a little sweet, they have to alter it. If you want more agave nectar, no chance, etc... 

I personally am never coming back: But thats because I don't live up there. If I lived in Cave Creek or Desert Ridge, etc, you'd probably eventually find a menu item you'd like and find a way to make the margaritas not too sweet. Like I did by adding beer to it.
