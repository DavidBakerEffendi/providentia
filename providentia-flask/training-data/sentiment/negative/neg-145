So this is Taco Bell's prettier little sister with mental issues and gonorrhea. The decor is nice and the staff is very friendly and attentive (which hurts me as i rate this restaurant so low). However, the meat i could barely recognize as anything that had parents. I had the bends not even 10 minutes later. 

The exposure the restaurant has received due to the show should have given them enough publicity to be successful. However, it's obvious that they did not fix some of the problems that were displayed on the show. If you saw how poorly the seats were cared for (and the filth that was found in the seat cracks), imagine how much care they take in preparing your food. Their cooking ability also cannot be improved after 2 days on a tv show. they resorted to their old habits and still deliver a cheap, tasteless  and horribly prepared product.
