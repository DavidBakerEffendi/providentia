Ordered takeout based on my fellow Yelpers' reviews.  That would be a big fat no.  Maybe you have to eat at the restaurant, but the Blackened Chicken (not, by the way) was inedible.  The Ginger Salad which didn't contain any, but consisted of iceberg lettuce a few shreds of old carrot was $4.  Bleh.
