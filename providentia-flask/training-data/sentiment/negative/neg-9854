This has nothing to do with their food. Having a toddler sometimes is not conducive to dining out. Tried placing an order THREE TIMES and was put on ETERNAL HOLD all three times. 
DO NOT try to call in an order. I surmise that they discourage that. Perhaps they feel that it is beneath them to accept an order to go!?!?!!!! Don't bother burning your mobile minutes on Noodle Asia. 
Sorry I can't recommend their cuisine since I wasn't given the opportunity to taste it.
