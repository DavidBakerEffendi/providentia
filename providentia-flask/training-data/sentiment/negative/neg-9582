I do not recommend Liberty Noodles. I decided to try something new at Urban eatery and I regret it!
The fast food joint seemed to be decently busy as there was a short lineup (not comparable to the lineups at the usual fast food establishments). While in line I saw their pre packaged gyozas and it was definitely a warning sign as those dumplings did not look appetizing- sadingly I missed the signal and ordered the Tonkotsu ramen. When a menu item has a thumbs up and it looks like a noodle bar..you think they would  know how to cook decent noodles right?! Unfortunately not, my noodles were undercook and it was borderline inedible. The soup base was bland and boring and nothing like a good bowl of ramen. The condiments included bamboo, thin slices of cha siu, half an egg (not runny), seaweed and corn. By the sad looks of the bowl, it was lacking something....
For the price of this ramen, I would definitely just go and line up for Santouka, Sansotei, or Raijin in the area

Also to note, my fianc√©e ordered a spicy chicken udon stir fry and he said it was just alright but nothing special. 
I know this is just fast food but I would have been so much happier with just a noodle soup bowl from the other Chinese fast food joints. Next time, we'll just stick with the regular places.
