This place has absolutely the worst table service. When I walked in, no one acknowledged me. I walked in and sat myself and was ignored for the first 15 minutes until someone came and got a drink order. After that, no one checked in on me for an hour. I barely got my check 45 minutes after I was done eating and I waited an extra half an hour for someone to come and get it. Don't eat at this location unless you feel like spending your entire night waiting for service. Not only that, but the same food stayed on the turn style belt the entire time I was there without being replenished so the food sat and got old. I won't be back.
