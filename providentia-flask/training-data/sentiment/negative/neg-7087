awful.  even for a stranded, hungry airport captive.

ordered the steak thai wrap.  3 bites into it, had to toss it. Still, stayed with me for 4 very uncomfortable hours. Who knows what I ingested but it was not something humans should consume--even on a bet.

hold your appetite for a joint that won't make you regret what you eat.
