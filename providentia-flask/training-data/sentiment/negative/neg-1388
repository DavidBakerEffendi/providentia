Let me just say that about a year ago this place was decent, however that has now changed. I spent 30 mins on the phone trying to get through to place my order and no one pick up( should have been my first clue) Next i placed the order on line then i called the restaurant again to see where my food was. The guy told me that it was on the way, cut to 1 hour later they finally picked up the phone again only to tell me that they just got my order and that he can cook it right now. Do I still want it or what???  I asked for the manager he sd "hello" like he didn't hear me. The guy said that his name was Danny ( yeah Right) and informed me that he would go cook my food right now, and that it would be here in about another HOUR. I asked for the manager again nothing. I then advised him that I would do what I'm doing right now, go straight to Yelp about this he hung up the phn...... I called Hunan express instead.
