I ate here for the first time today. my order was taken quickly and I was served rather fast too, it was tuesday so there were many empty places. I wanted to eat chicken katsu don, they explained me the sauce was not curry but some other so I decided to risk because I usually get a curry sauce with katsu but apparently, it's not a must :) the sauce was a bit too vinegary for my taste and bits of chicken tasted older, like when I keep meat in my fridge for a bit longer than I should. I didn't complain, it's not a habit of mine specially since I was alone. I wasn't interested in appetizers or soup but the salad/veggies were delicious. I also managed to eat a smaller part of rice since there was so much meat. I packed some for later because the portion was rather big :) the price was okay considering the size of portion and location. I would return but not to eat the same, I want to try UFO rice although its a bit much (plus +$3 to add cheese :/ ) but it looks interesting, or the bap to go. 

edit: my stomach hurts really bad tonight and I haven't really eaten anything else so it must be the old meat. I am really sorry, if the meat had been good I would have given 4/5
