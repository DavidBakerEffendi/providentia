Used to come here all the time but I won't be coming back. yesterday the service was terrible. We ordered all you in can eat but we barely ate because the waiter asked us once what we wanted and then sat in the back with his friends and didn't come back until "last call". The sushi tasted old and we were treated very badly. Don't go here.
