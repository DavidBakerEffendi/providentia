Pick up order completely wrong. Called and expected a free pizza to either be delivered or a free pizza in the future. After going back and forth with the cashier and the manager through the cashier, over the phone, they offered to have it delivered. I then received a call saying that the pizza was being made but I would have to pick it up. I had been home for 30 min and had no intentions of returning. Just forfeited the $10. Won't be ordering from this location again.
