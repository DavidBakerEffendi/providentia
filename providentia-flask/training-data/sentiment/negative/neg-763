The first few times I dined at honey salt, I would have given them five stars. The decor is adorable and their food is fantastic. The Brookie alone would have been enough to give five stars. The following few times I went, the service was terrible. Our server would disappear and the wait time to get our check was 30-40 minutes. 

My most recent visit was to try their new three course tasting menu for meatless Mondays.  I have been seeing great vegan and vegetarian menu options at my favorite restaurants lately and was excited to try what honey salt came up with. Let's start with the food...

Our first course was a green juice in a very tiny glass. It is the same juice they serve on their brunch menu and was good as usual. Our second course was a mushroom dish that literally had two mushrooms on a plate. They were seasoned well but, seriously, it was two mushrooms. The next dish was a risotto that was horribly undercooked and chewy. It was pretty plain and topped with a handful of peas. Desert was a bowl of mixed fruit that included moldy raspberries. To top all of this off, our server made us feel like circus freaks for ordering this menu. Sorry, honey salt, people who eat plant based diets are not weirdos and do enjoy eating actual food. The cost of that meal was ridiculously high, considering we were barely given anything edible and were mocked for ordering it.
