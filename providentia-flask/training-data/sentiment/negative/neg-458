High Rollers - Avoid This Stinkhole!

The Silverton only awards penny ploppies with comps and coupons.

The way their marketing team calculates offers is offensive; they need to hire an employee that can do basic math to see that their calculations are way off.

A slot player that plays $20 for 4 hours on a 5 cent denom receives fantastic offers; yet, a player that plays $1500 for 4 hours on $1 denom receives no offers. It's really a slap in the face, honestly.

Plus, while you're playing, you may get a headache, because they pump fragrances into the air, and that mixes with the baked in cigarette smoke that isn't filtered well.

The food prices have also gone up, while portions have gotten smaller. The steakhouse used to be good, but went downhill. The cafe is hit or miss.

These guys definitely deserve 1 star for their blatant disregard of certain players. I hope they enjoy the fruits of their $20 players. I'll take my bankroll where it can earn respect.
