came here with girlfriends and was seriously disappointed. not only in the food but the horrible service. first of all, the place was hardly packed so i am confused about the slow service. it appeared that only two people were working and both looked like they were having the worst day of their lives- unfriendly, slow and generally uninterested. we opted for the $25 2 course meal with a drink. while the drinks were nothing special, we were hoping that the food would be much better considering the menu description was relatively tantalizing. 

our appetizers were small and i could have swore i had seen (&eaten) the exact same samosas from evergreen health food store on roncesvalles. there was absolutely no difference in taste & appearance. my girlfriend ordered some dumplings (3 of them) that were tiny, greasy and came with a hot sauce that was not mentioned on the menu. through-out our meal the waitress barely visited us, never refilled our water (despite empty glasses) and didn't bother asking us if we wanted more drinks (the bartender had to serve us originally because she was nowhere to be found). actually, the whole night she was nowhere to be seen except only occasionally popping out from the back looking miserable. the atmosphere sucked, no music, you could hear everyones conversation, bartender shooting us evil looks, waitress gone, etc. even our main course was disappointing- over-cooked meat, sub par pasta, my gf found a HAIR in hers (nasty) and bland seasoning. 

what a disappointment, won't return here again.
