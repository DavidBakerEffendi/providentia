I ate there on 04/29/18 with my family. The place was filthy cups all over the bar needing to be bused. There were at least 6 tables that had dirty plates and drinks waiting to be bused for over an hour. The service was super slow and the waitress who kept calling us her sweets was terrible and never checked back on us after she took our order. Then the restroom, let me tell you there was trash everywhere. All over the floors, and counters. When my mom went to inform the staff. Including the manager they talked badly about her, after she left the restaurant, calling my mom a snob and stuck 
up and laughing. I will never return and I would advise Dennys look at this store closely cause after I post this I'm reporting to the health inspector.
