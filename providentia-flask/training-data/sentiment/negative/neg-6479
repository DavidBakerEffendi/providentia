I bought some food. I bought some drinks. My girlfriend decided to rest on the bench. They did not give me one verbal warning until they kicked my girlfriend out. They just told her to stand herself up and that is it. Once they grabbed my girlfriend, I yelled at them to drop her down. They did not and proceeded to bring her to the exit. She was not drunk, by the way, she was just very sleepy. She immediately followed orders, but still was physically abused and picked up. I left a phone call about the complaint and talked to one of your staff about it when i went back inside. The same person pushed me until I was out even though I was not speaking with him. I am very frustrated and abused and will not be doing any pleasure or business with this facility.
