Went here on a Sunday morning and must have just beat the rush, got seated right away.  The food however was not good.  The Pretzel* Croque Madame was cold untoasted bread covered in a beschemel sauce which was actually not terrible.  Unfortunately they failed to inform that the pretzel portion was not availabale.  When I mentioned that the bread was untoasted and quickly got soggy to the waitress she took my plate and had the chef microwave the plate.  This created a sloppy mess.  Despite my plea to simply just get a side of eggs (which I was ready to pay for)  I was rudely informed that the Croque Madame was up to the chefs standards and that I was being picky.
