They got the order wrong, got the change wrong and we couldn't pay the kids to take more than a bite of their cookies. my bear claw was on point, but the kids had two different cookies and neither of them wanted anything to do with theirs even after trading. I tried them both afterwards and was reminded of something my dad told me a long time ago, "you can paint a happy face on a coaster but that won't make it a cookie." I had no idea what he meant before now. that man is a geniuS.
