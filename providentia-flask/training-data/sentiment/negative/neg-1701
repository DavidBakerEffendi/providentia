WARNING Thanksgiving Brunch Diners. Only 18 of the 62 dishes that appear on the Bellagio Buffet Thanksgiving menu were served today at brunch. Huge disappointment this was our worst thanksgiving day meal ever. To make it worse, Items were not served hot & lacked flavor, wait staff was unsmiling at both table side and food stations. Save your money and the long wait. We had Campbell's tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner tonight & enjoyed it more.
