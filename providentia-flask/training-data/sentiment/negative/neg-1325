We came during a weekday for dinner so it was pretty quiet and service was decently quick. Waitress is friendly and environment is tidy. Unfortunately the food experience was not the greatest. We ordered a medium rare steak and it was very tough to chew. Tasted like a frozen steak that they put unto the grill. The fries were thick and super dry - again tasting like frozen package  (McCain's taste better). Veggies are also frozen that are steam and flavourless. Finally, the barely soup isn't much of a soup.. it taste like those alphabet canned soup. It was an overall disappointing experience. I do not recommend this location. There are definitely better locations. The restaurant wasn't busy at all and the bill took more than 20 minutes to come out.
