We have been in Verona for about a year now.  We have brought our children here and liked the food.  Recently we are remodeling our kitchen and eat here about once a week.  We happen to like sitting near the bar area for our kids to watch the fish and we can watch the Brewer game. We do not sit at the bar and our children are fairly well mannered. Tonight we were asked to leave the bar area and our children would be best seated somewhere else. Very disappointed in our service this evening.
