Wow, I used to absolutely love this place. I would come here at least twice a month. I haven't been back in the area for about 6 to 8 months and decided to pop in once again. 

I'm not sure who the surly guy at the grill is (baseball cap, slim, s&p hair), but he needs some serious lessons on how to interact with his customers. Rude, gruff and disinterested. I ordered the large chicken shawarma, which used to be fantastic. He didn't ask me about sauces, and only threw bits and pieces of some of the toppings inside. I went to grab a drink out of the cooler and came back and my shawarma was ready to go. These things usually get grilled for a good couple of minutes. He didn't even heat up the meat on the grill! It also is about half the size of the ones I used to get here. They don't even taste the same.

I can't count how many people I've recommended this place to. I'll make a conscious effort to rescind those recommendations.

What a shame!
