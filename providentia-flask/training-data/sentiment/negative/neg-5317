We walked in and were happy with the menu and set-up.  The girls at the register were nice and friendly.

We ordered the fish tacos, and they were good, UNTIL the last taco was being eaten and there was a HAIR (that was obviously not ours) in the taco, mixed in with the cabbage!  Disgusting!

We brought it to one of the servers attention and his reply was "Sorry, let me go let Javier know..." whom we assumed was a manager of some sort.  We waited another 5-10 minutes before the same server came back and the told us that "the kitchen" told him they could make him another or something else.  REALLY?!  We told him we did not want anything else.  He then said "Oh, okay, well, thanks then, you have a good day..."

I would AT THE VERY LEAST expect a refund, and we weren't even offered that.  I don't know if "Javier" is the manager, or if the manager was ever even notified of the situation.  All I know, is aside from the girls working the register, they do not know how a guest should be treated.  And it's managements fault for not properly training and enforcing appropriate behavior.

I know things happen, but it's how you handle it.  We will NOT be returning, nor will our friends/family.  Shame on you Wahoos.
