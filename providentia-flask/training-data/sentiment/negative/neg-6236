Called in a lunch order at 11AM, was immediately put on hold. When I told him that I had an order for 8 meals, I was told "oh, I guess I need paper and a pen, hold on." And was put on hold again. Then I was put on hold (without being told) during the middle of my order. I made a mistake during my last order and promptly got yelled at by the employee. Then I was told my order would be ready in 30 minutes. Spoiler alert - order wasn't ready in 30 minutes. The promised time on my ticket was 11:18 and I finally demanded a refund at 12:15 because they didn't even start my order, which was not correct (due to the incompetent human on the phone). I got an attitude about my refund and a half assed apology. And now I'm hangry.
