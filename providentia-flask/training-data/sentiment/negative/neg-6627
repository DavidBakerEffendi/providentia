I gave it one star only because the service was excellent. The mild salsa is tomatoe sauce with chili powder. The hot salsa is mild enough for a Midwesterner. They put VegAll in EVERYTHING! Seriously? Potatoes and Lima Beans in Tamales? Carrots and Corn in taco meat? I'm frankly embarrassed they are even in business. It is a great dishonor to a fine cuisine that I love dearly. Great service but the food is horrendous. Do not waste your time and money. Honestly? Taco Bell is better!!!!
