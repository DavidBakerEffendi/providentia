Oh my! What happened?? Service was terrible and food even worse. Maybe the crew was tired. Maybe they don't care anymore. I had the feeling that if you're not a regular, you're not worth the service. I got to the restaurant early with my mom before the rest of the family. We had no service until they saw my uncle come in. Then it all changed. I must say that my cousin is married to the daughter of the original owner of Kam Shing, the sweet Mr. Kwong. So these people know who he is. But that doesn't make it right. Not because they don't know me nor my mother that we deserved that kind of shitty service. Anyways...

The food is nothing like it used to be. Salty, very overly oily. It lacked flavour all together. It looks like it should but nah... I have nothing good to say about this place at the moment. What a shame. Really.
