Horrible experience. We paid $30 to take a taxi here from all the way across town and they basically said we're not interested in serving you. When we arrived the hostess gave us the cold shoulder, and the head waiter (bald Asian guy) said and I quote...."we can't serve you, we're too busy", I said "what about those two tables right there, they can easily seat 5", he responded with "even if we seat you we won't be able to help you for awhile because we are too busy". I managed a restaurant for 4 years and I have never seen anything so ridiculous in my life. We left the restaurant extremely disappointed. Will never be back.
