It saddens me to write such a bad review for one reason - I might be Fuego Bistro's biggest fan.  So you can imagine how excited I was when I heard they were opening a taco place right around the corner from where I live.  Sometimes excitement quickly turns to disappointment and sadness, and such is the case with Fuego Tacos.

Let's just go start to finish:
-Salsa is inedible.  Way too spicy, and not good spicy, it's damn take this away spicy
-Drinks - half the size of the ones at Fuego Bistro, no good.  Not enough alcohol and the Sangria (which is top-notch at Bistro) tasted more like red Kool Aid
-Food - not so good.  I got the veggie tacos, which tasted more like a taco shell filled with sweet (not good-sweet, bad-sweet) corn salsa.
-Service - not too bad, but management response was a turn off.  We went in with Enamor coupons that clearly stated there were no limits, and they would only let us use one even though we were 2 parties with 2 checks.  Owner was called on the phone and didn't provide a great response.
-Atmosphere - would be awesome, but not for this place.  More of a trendy could-be club guised as a fancy taco place.

Please, check out the reviews for Fuego Bistro and go there.  It quite possibly offers the best food, service, and patio dining in Phoenix.  Fuego Tacos needs an overhaul, and I can for sure say I won't be back.
