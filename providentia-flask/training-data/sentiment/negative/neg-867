My friend and I decided to have dinner here.  The food just awful and service was lacking.  We ordered the vegetable soup which had chunks of ginger, hardly any of veggies or lentils.  The worst part of the meal was the main dish we ordered the tandoori chicken sag it was mushy and the chicken was poor quality chewy and gristly.  My friend pointed this out to the waitress and she told her maybe it wasn't cooked and she would let the cook know and that was it. What kind of response is that?  We will definitely not be back.
