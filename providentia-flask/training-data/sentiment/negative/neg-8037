Should have known this wasn't the place to order from. Called before ordering from Grub hub to ask how many fried oysters came to an order...10 for those who are curious. Made the order to be delivered. They called 10 minutes later saying they are out of oysters. After I threw a fit over the fact that I had just called, and they said nothing about being out of them, then they came back saying they had one more order of them. When the meal came, it was mediocre at best. I've had better tasting Chinese food in my small home town. This is Vegas...step it up or get out!
