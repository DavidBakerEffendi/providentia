I generally don't review bars unless there's something really fantastic about them and I never review any place to just talk about the service. But honestly, the service was THAT bad to the point that it should be talked about. 

I came here with two friends on a Friday night for some drinks. The place was decently full, not too packed but with a healthy amount of people. It took a while for a server to ask for our order and even longer for a drink and food menu to be brought. I was a bit baffled to find that the drink menu didn't have any prices listed anywhere and the server was unhelpful and ballparked the prices.

When we placed our order, the server was adamant about getting a credit card to open up a tab for us despite our insistence that we were planning on paying in cash. She then proceeded to tell us how she had people run off on their tab last week and how she really didn't want it to happen again and asked us to be honest and pay before we left. On one hand I understand that that sort of thing is a problem (obviously - completely rude and honestly vile behavior) on the other hand I'm not sure it was appropriate to tell us that and then proceed to treat us as though we were planning on doing the same thing the entire time we were there. 

It took a while to get two of our drinks. It took even longer to get our third drink which was a plain Coke. The place emptied out as we waited for straws for our drinks. When she brought them over, the server banged the unwrapped straws against the rather sticky table and placed them in our drinks and walked off in an agitated manner. By that point we honestly just wanted to finish our drinks and leave which honestly, didn't take that long. The drinks were 75% ice. I get that it was a mixed drink for a bit over $6 but I still expected a bit better.

I'm hoping this experience was a one-off but between the completely lackluster drinks and honestly horrible and downright rude service I'm not planning on coming back.
