I'm a big fan of Kelly's. Love the food. Love the drinks. 


But do NOT go on a Friday unless you want to wait 20 minutes without anyone helping you, asking for a cocktail menu and having them tell you it's long and unavailable and a waiter who doesn't know what is in any of their dishes.  Or maybe you enjoy that, in which case you should apply for the Friday night staff, you'd be a great anti-social addition. 

Any other time Kelly's has a great menu, awesome cocktails and friendly bartenders. But watch out for snatchy Fridays.
