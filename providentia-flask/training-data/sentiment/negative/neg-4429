This is probably the worst place in all of downtown. Horrible music. Horrible bouncers. Horrible crowd. There are plenty of other great dance clubs and trendy bars in the area. Do not waste your time here! There is also a cover, which is ridiculous for the level of service you get. (Hint: the service is non-existent)
