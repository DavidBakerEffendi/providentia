I have been a loyal Pei Wei customer for at least half a decade now. Every Pei Wei that I have visited before has been amazing and I have had no issues. For some reason, this one falls so short on customer service that it just drove me away from the chain completely. I had a similar issue as one of the previous reviewers with a coupon of Pei Wei's not being honored by their restaurant or not applying to the order. However, it wasn't just that part that put me off...it was the attitude of the workers and the manager in general. I placed an order online and came in when there was pretty much no one else in the restaurant. When I came up to the register to get my food, I was treated as if I was a nuisance or that I was interrupting the "oh so busy" manager - who, might I add, was dicking around on his phone at the time. I mentioned that I had a coupon and the manager just said "uh huh.." in a very annoyed tone and basically grabbed my phone out of my hands to scan it. He never asked me for my phone number so that I could get Wei Rewards points from the order either. I was honestly too afraid to ask because I didn't want to deal with anymore of his piss-poor attitude. If this Pei Wei did a serious overhaul and put the manager in some basic customer service courses or canned him altogether, this place might have a chance again from me. As of right now, I'm NEVER dining at Pei Wei again.
