Terrible customer service, couldn't eat there even though I wanted to and tried to go!

I called two weeks ago to make a lunch reservation. The lady on the phone had to double check if they do lunch, but confirmed that yes they do, so took the reservation. 

Called again a week ago to move the reservation earlier, but the guy on the phone couldn't find the reservation I've made. He apologized, then took my reservation again with the help of some other staff (he didn't know how to operate the reservation system, it seems).

Then today, my friend and I went at the reservation time (11:45), and they were not open! Someone (I think it's Brett? From pics on the website) came out to say they only did lunch during summerlicious, and was surprised to find that I was able to make reservations with their staff on the phone. Apparently they only open at 5pm now. 

Seriously, how unorganized do you have to be for your staff to 1) not know when you are open, 2) confirm a wrong opening time, and 3) can't make reservations properly??? Twice too!!
At least you could've called me earlier to clarify, so I don't need to find out when I've already made my way to the restaurant. 
And please update your hours both on your walls and on the website, I highly doubt you only open at 11:30pm on weekdays. 

Really not happy with how things went down. I had been wanting to try their food, but this basically ruined it for me. Will not try again.
