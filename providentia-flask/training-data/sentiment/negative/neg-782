I asked at my hotel for a nearby restaurant, and was directed to Zarra's, right across the street.  It's a little deceptive--you have to go through a bar in the front to the actual restaurant, where the decor is very nice, and the staff is friendly...and unbelievably incompetent.  I put in my order.  The waiter seemed to have trouble grasping which dish I wanted, so I opened the menu and pointed it out to him.  That was at 8 p.m.  By 8:30, I was wondering what the problem was.  Ten mintues after that, a waiter came over and asked if I'd ordered yet!   So I got a menu and pointed it out again, mentioning that I'd ordered it some time ago.  And ANOTHER twenty minutes passed before my salad, bread and main course arrived virtually simultaneously.  What, they couldn't have brought me the salad a little sooner, seeing as they'd screwed up so badly already?   The food was okay, but nothing special.  But don't come here unless you're planning to spend a LONG time waiting.  (And, no, no one apologized or even said anything about the wait.)
