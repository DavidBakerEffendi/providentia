Every time I come to this place I'm always disappointed. I stopped here because I needed coffee STAT. I was the only person in the drive-through. I placed my order. One medium coffee with almond milk and one Splenda. That's all. I get to the window the lady asked me what my order was. At this point I've already tipped her one dollar and I'm hesitant on asking for it back. A different lady give me my coffee and asked me if I had ordered anything else. Omg 
Get with it guys.
