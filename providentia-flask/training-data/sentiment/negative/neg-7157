Went in to eat there for the first time.  The guy working there kept calling me boss, which was annoying.  The meat didn't look fresh at all and was cold.  I wanted ground beef, but there was only a little bit left and it looked very old.   
The food line area looked very messy.  When I picked up the tacos, they both fell apart instantly and I had to eat them with a fork.   The food simply wasn't very good.
