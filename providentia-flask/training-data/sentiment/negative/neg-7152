My visit was a complete Nightmare and I wish I could turn back time to have made a better late night dining choice. 

I paid $23.00 for two burritos, added guacamole for $1.25 each and opted for take out.

When we drove a short distance home to sit and eat I realized my burrito had no guacamole in it I was let down. 

If you are going to charge me for guacamole then I expect their to be more than a teaspoon in my burrito.

I called Pepe's to voice my complaint, the girl answered and spoke in Spanish. I asked if anyone was available to speak in English to assist me. 

She said yes is me and proceeded in English. I asked her name and she replied "what you need?" I again asked for her name she again replied the same what you need?  

I explained my issue and she asked for my receipt number and said hold on, she came back on the line and said my Kitchen Manager Hector said he put guacamole on your burrito. 

End of story.
