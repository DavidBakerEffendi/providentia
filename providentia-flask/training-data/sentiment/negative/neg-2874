We ordered delivery from this place and were told it would be 45 minutes to an hour wait. An hour and 5 minutes later I called to check the status of our delivery. I was informed that the lady who took my order passed it along and the guy who took it from her set it aside, and that they were wall to wall cleaning so not taking any orders. The man apologized and offered a store credit, but we are not from here and were leaving the next morning. Not impressed since they had my contact information and could have called immediately to say there had been a mistake and they could not take any orders that night.
