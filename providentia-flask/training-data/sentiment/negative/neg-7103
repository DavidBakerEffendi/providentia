I heard about this place and was excited to try it out. 1. Place seemed chill loved the out door area. 2. Bar outside was packed so we chose to go in and take a table. The hostess showed us to our table. 10 mins went by before anyone ask us for drinks..15 mins went by and we got tired of waiting. I kept looking to the bar and the guy there wasn't making any drinks. Finally we got up and left. Nice place horrible service. We ended up at wild wing instead. We got served within 5mins of being seated. I would rate it a zero if I could.
