Well, we decided to try Saddle Ranch again. Amy, our server, was the only good thing.
Imagine being greeted by two hostesses who have nose rings the size of what a bull has.  just nasty  
The mashed potatoes were cold and gummy.  The monster app-everything was cold.  The chicken wings were bloody.  The sliders were not edible, they were so hard.  The waitress brought us another one.  Seriously, it was no better.  disgusting
The manager came over.  She had this taken off the bill.  Amy did give us a complimentary dessert which was awesome.
The sugar holder was splashed with dried food.  The salt and pepper shakers were sticky.

Ok   You got a second chance and there will be no more.  They don't deserve any stars.
