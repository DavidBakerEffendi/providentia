It has been probably 6 or 7 years since my last visit to a TGI Fridays and now I remember why.

Perhaps Im showing my age a bit here, but I recall 15 - 20 years ago that Friday's was the place to be and had relatively good food.  Alas, those days are long gone.

We started with the Warm Pretzels and "craft beer dipping sauce".  How bad could that be, right?   Well, instead of pretzels I would swear that these were your average restaurant bread sticks with some sort of egg wash and salt added to them.  Other than the salt, these tasted nothing like a pretzel.

My wife got the broccoli and cheese soup as well which looked and tasted exactly the same as the cheese dipping sauce for the pretzels with a few stems of broccoli thrown in.  

We held out hope for the Burger and Salad that we ordered for out entrees, but there was no hope to be had.  The Bun was old and stale, the burger was definitely frozen and had a bad texture to it and of course, the fries were cold.

My wife ordered the Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad.  She had 4 or 5 bites and was done.  It was just off tasting.

The service was decent - what could be expected these days at the middle of the road chains.  We never saw a manager, but I guess if I was serving this food, I would be hiding in the back office as well.

What a shame to see Friday's fall so far.   I mean, is it really that hard to make a FRESH Burger?  If the mall kiosk can make a pretzel, why can't this place.  

I really had reasonable expectations going in, but yet they still found a way to disappoint.
