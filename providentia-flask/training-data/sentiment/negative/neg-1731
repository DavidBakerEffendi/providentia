Trash place, trash crowd and trash service. Even if this is your last drunchies option at 4 am, you better just hit they hay and call it a night. To make it worse, the staff is simply rude. The guy that served me thought he was some sort of gangster, heating up slices of pizza from behind the counter. Almost funny. There's better places close by.
