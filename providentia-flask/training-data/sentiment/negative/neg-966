Very disappointed!! Lived in Vegas for 2 years and finally decided to go here as part of our date night.. and wow, what a let down! The service was horrible, Brought to our table after being asked," Are you only eating dessert?" Waited far too long for our server to come by. And the ice cream we did have after our meal was worse than store bought. I'm sure it was our fault for expecting more.. good service when you're paying $13 for a plain sundae and good dessert from a place that has the title "Sugar factory" is too much to ask. Went onto the website to try and send a comment but man, it looked like a random mom and pop shop website.. horrible
