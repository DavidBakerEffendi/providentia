I'm sorry but I had to give a star; the only reason I did give any. I figure if by chance I don't get sick that's worth the one star. Otherwise, this place was not good to me and my family at all! We are avid foodies and really appreciate great food. At the same time we hate wasting money on horrible food. This place was a waste of almost $26! We ordered 3 lbs of wings (approx 7 wings per lb). 1 of sweet chili jerk 1 strawberry cheesecake and 1 garlic mild. It was late Sunday night so possibly the best cooks were off. The meat was so bland my crew refused to finish them. The sauce was an afterthought, meaning I probably would have been better eating baked unseasoned chicken then pouring some sauce in my mouth after a few bites. Think white looking wings with little specks of sauce here and there! And the size.... The wings were tiny! Think 1 1/2 bite size wings... At approx $1.25 per wing! Smh horrible! If your search app brings up this place as nearby, like mine did tonight, do yourself a favor and drive an extra gallon to somewhere else! Trust me, the $2.86 (I drive premium) is worth it!!! Never again! ***and if by chance management see this post. Please note the way to make me a happy customer is to refund my cc. Don't think a meal replacement could fix the boiled chicken wing taste in my mouth now.
