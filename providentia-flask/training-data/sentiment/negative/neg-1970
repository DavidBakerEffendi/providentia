I not only wasted $20 but I also wasted two hours of my life. I think the idea of tapas is a great one but Arpa lacks severely on execution. The place itself is really cool and the service is great but you are only paying for atmosphere. The goat cheese balls are good but that's where the buck stops. I went with a large group, there were eight of us, so I got to sample a good portion of the menu. I would not recommend it to anyone I actually consider a friend. It is a poor sampling of Spanish influenced food. I left starving and aggravated.
