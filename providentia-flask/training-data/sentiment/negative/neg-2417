I've been coming here for a couple years now and the food is really good.The staff is friendly very friendly(thank you guys!) But let me tell you about this "manager" jerry. He is a joke!!!, very rude and inconsiderate. This "man" has no respect or manners for his guests, honestly I will not be returning here if this p.o.s is still working here. Anna is amazing .. She should be running this show :)...
