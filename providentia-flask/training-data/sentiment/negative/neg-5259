Not sure what the point of mobile order pick-up is if the workers just ignore you. We showed up about five minutes before our pick-up time, and our orders weren't ready--as expected. But then we stood there and waited as our food was prepared--after 10 or so customers went through the line--and then we continued to stand there at the mobile pick-up as the cashier ignored us and continued to cash people out. It must have been thirty people through the line before we were acknowledged again. Basically, we stood for twenty minutes, having already paid and ordered in advance, and when we got the food it was cold, my burrito was crushed and spilt open in the bag, and my side of queso was shoved so far into my beverage cup that I had to pry it out and it spilled all over the inside.
