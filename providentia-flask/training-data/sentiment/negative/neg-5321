I don't do this too often but I eat out a lot so here goes....
1.  My beer was stale, must have gotten warm then cold.
2. Chili was bland and crackers were stale.
3. French fries were soft and mouchy, actually inedible.
4.  BLT was very good.
5.  My wife's sandwich was just ok.
6.  We'll never go back.
