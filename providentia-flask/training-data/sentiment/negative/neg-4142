When I was 21, a group of my more straight-edge college friends decided they wanted to go to Las Vegas.  

A week before the trip, my dentist told me I absolutely had to go to Battista's.  Sure thing.  Then-boyfriend and I checked it out.  We thought it was great.

Fast forward four years... my brother is now living in Vegas, and my immediate family decided to meet there for Christmas.  Having remembered my wonderful experience at this restaurant, I decided we should all go.  BIG mistake.  The wine tasted like 2-buck Chuck that had been opened five days before.  The salad was comprised of iceberg lettuce and topped off with a hunk of salami.  I'm pretty sure the sauce was Ragu.  My brother, an erstwhile captain in the Army, said he'd rather have an MRE (meal ready to eat) than dine at Battista's again.

The little man playing the accordion knew the Ohio State fight song.  Battista's better hang onto that guy - it's the only reason they even get a star.
