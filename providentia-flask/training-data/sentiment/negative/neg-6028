Very tiny and kinda unkempt place in a  working class neighborhood. Lots of poor birds cooped up in miserable cages on the patio. We arrived at 11 am ish and spent over an hour waiting for our breakfast in the sweltering heat. Servers nice enough, food fine but really an hour? WTHeck? So... not worth the wait, over rated big time. SKIP IT!
