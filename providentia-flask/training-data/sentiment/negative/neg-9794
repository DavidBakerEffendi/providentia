I bought a Groupon for this place. Total scam. The groupon was $10.99 for 2 Burgers. However, the groupon does not include toppings (learn this when the receipt comes to you). Each burger goes for 6.99 to begin with... so you can do the math. At most you'll save a dollar. Total scam. 

In terms of quality of food: this pales in comparison to Burger Priest and The Works Gourmet Burger. It is also cheaper at The Works. 

There is also no real Air Conditioning at the place. Expect to be sweating while eating.
