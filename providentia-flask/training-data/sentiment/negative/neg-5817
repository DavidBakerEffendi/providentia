The worst service ever. Horrible staff it's usually bad but today it was worse. Often ppl r seated before us that arrived after us. This happened today and I questioned it and she pointed at the bar and said just sit over there ok. So me my son and my disabled friend sat at a two person place at the bar. No one came to get us drinks. I had to get up and ask for them they arrived after we were finished w out meal. No refills were given had to ask for napkins multiple times. My son was seated right next to the rotator so he could reach the food. The rotator stopped working. We were over charged for our meal and when I went up to pay. I was ignored. I finally asked if someone was going to ring me up and the same rude woman said to me why do u come here u always complain. I complain bcuz the ppl doing the service t horrible and I'm hoping to help them do a better job. The food is good but I will never b back. Bcuz the service is shit!
