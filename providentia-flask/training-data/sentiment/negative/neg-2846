I came here back in late January and my friend raved about this place so, our friends all decided to have takeout here. We're ordered crab Rangoon, pad Thai, pad kee Mao, yellow curry chicken, fried rice, etc. I had a taste of everything and I was sooooooo disappointed with everything. I'm from SF and thai food here is amazing!  I was really looking forward to eating this meal until I opened my box and the noodles were so different. It wasn't the wide flat noodles they serve in SF- it was thin flat noodles that were so bland that soy sauce didn't even help boost the flavor. The fried rice was nasty but the curry chicken was the best. I wished I had ordered that instead. The staff were nice enough to call us a cab and give us all the utensil and paper plates needed for our group. The restaurant was cleaned but at the hour of 5:00pm, there was no one dining there a all.
