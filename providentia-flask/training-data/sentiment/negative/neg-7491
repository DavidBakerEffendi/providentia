Very upset about having my event here. When reservations were made we noted 25 people which we were told would cater a party comfortably. However there was very little wiggle room to socialize. I offered some suggestions to accommodate our party should tables open up in the patio area or downstairs in a corner to offer more space (even though they should have had the foresight to). The night manager was very rude accusing us of "stressing out" the waitress. She was not open or receptive to any ideas. As of now there is plenty of openings in the patio area yet no attention to our party to provide a more comfortable atmosphere. Not our waitress, but the other waitresses that helped bring up our food gave us attitude and was obvious about rolling her eyes at us.  We've had to ask for service more than a couple times as it seemed they cut us off, if you will, after the interaction. Our company has many events and we will NEVER come here or recommend this place again.
