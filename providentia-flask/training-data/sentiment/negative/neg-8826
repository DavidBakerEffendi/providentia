We had THEE ABSOLUTE WORSE EXPERIENCE at Bellagio Buffett and let me first start by saying that Randy -- the manager at night is the WORST manager we've ever experienced especially when it comes to handling customer service. Clearly needs to be fired, re-trained or take a year long course in customer service. And this is coming from a family who also works in the service industry.

We had 6 people in our party and we're told upon arriving that the food stations closed at 10:30pm. My family honestly doesn't eat much despite being at a buffet and made one round. The second round for dessert was at 10:05pm (CLEARLY more than enough time for the buffet to close as were told). Some of the stations started closing early, specifically the ice cream station. But this is not what made it the worst experience... The server who was closing it, cut people off who were already in line to use it. My cousin (who is ALSO a server) politely asked if she could still use it before she shut it down. And their server told her that it was already closing and pre-made bowls would be available. Melted ice cream YUCK! Still this isn't what made it the worst experience. My cousin mentioned something to one of the floor supervisors who was VERY nice (wish I caught her name) who got the manager -- Randy. Instead of simply apologizing and asking how he could ammend the situation, he starts EXPLAINING the ice cream process  as if we need to know or care about the employees ice cream process. When my aunt steps in, he starts to go back and forth with her in front of her husband and gets really rude. It was honestly shocking. Anyways, so sad as nice of a hotel as Bellagio is, that their customer service doesn't match up. We also took video to show proof, that their stations DO NOT close at 10:30pm, but earlier.... Upper management, please do something! Would give zero stars if I could.
