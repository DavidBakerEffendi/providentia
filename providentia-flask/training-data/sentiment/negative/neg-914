Strongsville, OH 15029 Pearl Rd. DON'T GO TO THIS LOCATION! There is absolutely nothing good about this location. The service is slow and the staff is unfriendly. The food is sub par and inconsistent - the chicken is not "charred" and salted as it supposed to be (per management). The portions are extremely inconsistent. In the early days, they gave heaping spoonfuls of chicken and steak - now you barely get a spoonful. In my most recent visit, the servings of rice, chicken, and barbacoa were HALF what they used to be. If you want more, you have to pay for it. When I asked why the drastic change and I was told the server just attended training with the new management and those are the serving sizes they are instructed to give from now on. Chipotle is hurting financially (stock down 13%) and cutting costs may be their strategy to try to boost the bottom line. When the patronage slows even more than it has in recent months they may start closing stores!
