This was a horrible experience tonight! We got a table quickly and then sat there for about 10 - 15 minutes with no server ever coming over to our table to get us a drink or anything? We complained and then they said they would get someone. The waitress kept helping the table next to us even though she never looked our way at all! The hostesses were both baffled and offered us water but it was too late and already 9:00 pm and we wanted food and a beer after going to a track meet all night and working all day! Don't go here if you want good service or any food after 8:00 p.m.!
