Please just don't waste your time, or money here. It's trash. 

Made an order online at 8pm, arrive at 8:30pm to pick it up only to be told that they don't have sushi. They've had that ticket for 30min and NO ONE could call/email that they were out of sushi? Laziness. 

Rest of the food was gross, the rice bowls had very low portions of protein, but tons of old stale rice to make up for it. 

You should just eat out of the trash can outside, at least you'd get your money's worth.
