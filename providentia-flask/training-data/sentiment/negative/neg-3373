My family and I are locals and we've been here many times. Generally it is enjoyable but today was probably the most annoying and disappointed experience. 
The food itself was good, it's usually consistent. But the service was beyond awful. We are Korean so we know and expect a decent level of respect but our waitress was rude, argumentative, and not accommodating. 

Our food came out later than everyone, the food came out separately, they forgot our order, and when we expressed our discontent, the waitress argued. It was very annoying and we won't be coming back.
