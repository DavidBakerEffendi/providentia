Eaten here perhaps 3 or 4 times over many years. Each time I remember why I never made it a place to return to. This is for the lunch buffet only. The food on the buffet was too heavy. Too much butter(ghee) and cream based food Not enough vegan choices (actually perhaps only one or two vegan choices). 
Even my partner that's not vegan didn't fancy the buffet food.  We both were surprised at how popular this place is.
