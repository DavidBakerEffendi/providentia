I went to this place to check out their ramen. Despite its good review, their ramen was extremly bad. The noodle was well over cooked and the soup was lacking flavor. It is not even close to be a authentic Japanese ramen. The Karrage was undercooked and it looked like they just put the frozen chicken in a microwave. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
