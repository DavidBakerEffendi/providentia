OMG...AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COST!  The place is FILTHY, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like!  The smell of the homeless hanging around front of restaurant will ruin your appetite as you enter, however if that doesn't you will definitely be having second thoughts on your decision after seeing the cleanliness inside.  I ordered a fish sandwich with rings and when I got out to my vehicle I noticed the bag was sooooo SATURATED from the grease, of not only the rings but the fish as well!  The box from the rings was sooooo saturated that it was falling apart.  I had no time to go back in because although I was only 1 of 3 people in there my order took 20 MINUTES! I usually am a fan of JIB but this location is a black eye on them.  Corporate should do a pop in and see how horrendous this place is.  I ended up choking down what I could because I was so hungry, bad decision,  I wound up so sick from the grease it wasn't worth it.  So in ending I guess it comes down to are you a gambler?  Take a chance at eating here...I don't understand why the previous reviews were 3 stars it sounded like they had some of the same experience I did.
