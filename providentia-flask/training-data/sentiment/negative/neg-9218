Worst pizza I've ever had. (Not an exaggeration.) We tried the new Grilled Chicken Margarita pizza. There were about 2 piece of tomato per slice and 2-3 pieces of chicken. The "thin" crust was tasteless and over cooked. Waste of money. I thought Papa Johns was running a new campaign because they improved their pizza...but they didn't...must just be to try and make sales. Go to Marco's instead...way better.
