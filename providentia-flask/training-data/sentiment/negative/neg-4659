it's a buffet.

expect the food to be mediocre.
expect a line for the lobster dish.
expect them to run out of lobster for 20 minutes.
expect the foom to be poorly heated i their warming trays or under their warming light.
expect the only action to be by the hot seafood: lobster, crab leggs...
expect peoplen to try and cut u in line.
expect to have an empty soda glass our entire for you entire meal: servers go around picking up your lobster and crab carcasses and refilling soda and water.
expect your meal not to come with alcohol (full bar between food areas).
expect a giant wait before you're even seated.

this place is all about waiting.

i quit coming here. f this place.
went to buzzios and for the same price  the quality is exxtreme. sure, it's not as much food, but i bet a lot of these good reviews are by obese people. 

what do you prefer: 
QUALITY or QUANTITY?

the best part is the full dessert bar. sad, huh?
