I just don't get it.  Reviewers seem to really like this place but the steak I had this past Friday evening was so not worth the $65 price tag. I had the 35 day dry aged bone in ribeye. It was chewy, fatty and not very flavorful.  There was an overpowering rosemary flavor.  While I enjoy the herb it was a flavor mismatch, in my opinion.  The steak was over cooked slightly but I dealt with it. 

Earlier in the week, I ate at Stripsteak in Mandalay Bay and for $5 more, I had a American Wagyu ribeye cap that ranks in my top three steaks of all time.  Plus they give you duck fat fries. 

Skip this pedestrian steakhouse and go directly to Stripsteak.
