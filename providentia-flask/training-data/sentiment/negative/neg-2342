Months ago I wrote a raving review about Bluebird Kitchen; however after this morning's 25 minute wait for a toasted bagel and cream cheese I can't say that I'd go back there. I stood by and watched order after order come out from the kitchen wondering where my order was. I realized afterwards that the staff at the counter are responsible for simple toasted orders. Those staff members prioritized customers' orders that came in after my own, which allowed my wait time to continue to build. Needless to say I wasn't impressed by their customer service whatsoever. Don't bother checking this place out, it's not worth the time.
