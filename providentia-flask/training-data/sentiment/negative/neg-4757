Ridiculous,  should be no stars as no food was prepared when I ordered for pick up. Placed order online for 4 pizzas and several orders of wings. Received confirmation email and pick up time and NO notification that that we were "supposed"to call and confirm... 

Showed up at our designated time to pick up the order for our staff with of course nothing even started and was informed we were supposed to call and confirm by the older gentleman working there. 

Horrible customer service and respect for time.  Would hate to see you call to make an appointment at ouroffice and then we cancel it because you didn't call us again to confirm that you really did want your appointment you already scheduled. 

Little Caesars here we come.
