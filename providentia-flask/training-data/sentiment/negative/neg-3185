Horrible experience here. When I came in no one was up front. After 3 mins or so someone finally came up to us and told us they will come back and seat us. From there she proceeded to go around to here other tables to get them drinks and take their orders. So after 10 mins or standing there we decided to leave.

Don't go here!
