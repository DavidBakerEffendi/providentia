I can't stand this place.  Yet another yogurt company capitalizing on the FroYo craze of 2008 and this one is terribly executed.  Most of the places operate in a normal order-person fills order-pay-eat format.  Not MoJo.  They, for whatever reason, want to be different.  This means it is self-service almost the whole way through.  

You wait in line for a machine that puts out the flavor of yogurt you want.  Then when you get there, it is usually blinking and telling you that you have to wait for it to freeze up.  Once you get a decent amount of yogurt, it usually tells you that you have to wait again because it has to refreeze.  10 minutes later, you have filled a cup comparably to what you usually get at a Full Service Yogurt place.  

You then are given the ability to top it off with a tray of condiments similar to the breakfast bar at Holiday Inn.  Of course, you have no idea where those spoons have been and can almost guarantee that some 5 year old licked his yogurt, then stuck the spoon in it as he was pouring too many M&Ms on his frozen treat.  So you top off your yogurt in a manner similar to what you would find elsewhere and move to the next station.

You have no reached the end where you finally interact with a human.  This person then weighs your creation (mind you it is the exact same as one you would get at a full service yogurt place) and then he tells you that it will be $15.  I'm sorry what?  $15 for yogurt.  This size is $5 at every other yogurt place and you want three times that?  When I did all of the work?  Oh no.

These places are such a ripoff.  It costs them $0.08 per ounce of this stuff.  Unless you are covering it with caviar, macadamia nuts, and gold leaves - it isn't worth what they charge.
