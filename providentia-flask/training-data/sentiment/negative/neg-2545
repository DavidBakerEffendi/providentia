I'm so disappointed.  I usually love this place, the Monte Cristo is my favorite and their white cheddar mac is usually so delicious. 
I just picked up dinner for my husband and I, however,  and they forgot the sauce that makes the sandwich so good - it's advertised as crispy and it was soggy; I'm not going to eat it. They forgot his drink, the bread they used for his sandwich was stale and the macaroni and cheese tastes like they made it yesterday-ish. 

I called and they told me they'd refund my credit card for the soda. 

Thirty bucks down the drain. 

I won't be going back.
