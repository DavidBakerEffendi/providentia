Just like many tourist trap restaurants, this one had terrible service and mediocre food.  We were there for a birthday party, we had about 12 people there.  Everyone arrived for 9, ordered their food, and we didn't get it until 10:45 - almost 2 hours!  Drinks took about 30 minutes and the waitress, Lorilynn, was defensive and snooty about it when we addressed it.  The food was bland, and seemed very tourist - big portions, good presentation, but tastes like they just threw sauce at it.  We had ribs that tasted like sweet thai and BBQ sauce mixed together.  Everything was deep fried.  The decor was nice, it's too bad their service is awful, for a service industry, you really have to look out for that...

Worst part is - she tipped herself 18% gratuity, I would not have given her that.
