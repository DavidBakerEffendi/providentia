Made a reservation for my moms 60th birthday. We invited friends and family. I was given the wrong information (price and the time allowed to stay). The painful part is that the manager will not accept their mistake. He wanted to kick us out unless we pay the full price. So even though we have the agreement signed by the supervisor, it didn't matter. Be careful when you deal with this people. Lack of communication between managers and supervisors and also Lack of training...  The place is not being run professionally.
So BEWARE!
