The waiter took our order and we never saw him again. He failed to bring us our ice waters and when we flagged somebody down the hostess ended up bringing out 4 cups and a large container of water. She didn't even bother to pour it she set it down and walked away. To top it all off they also failed to bring out a dish we had ordered, which we would've told him had he ever came back to our table. 

The cherry on top is they tried charging us for a dish they never brought out. Don't go here unless its the last option. There are much better places to eat at with much much better service.
