We went there during Christmas and lined on the express line because I'm MGM gold. I happened to forget to bring my member card so I logged in to Mlife website on my phone and showed the page to the greeting lady. She immediately refused to honor my membership and said I had to have my card with me. I was confused because it had worked before when I didn't have my physical card. So I was guessing if she was new here and politely asked for her supervisor. 
The gentleman came and insisted to refuse to honor my membership. But this time there was a new excuse: Only Noir members were allowed on this line. He talked so rudely and even pointed to the exit to tell me to go. It was what I never experienced before, not to mention I'm a gold member. So I decided to argue and asked why the reasons to decline my entry were different from him and the lady. Also I asked for people on the line if they all were Noir members. The answer was NO. However, what the supervisor did was asking me to go, in a very, very rude way. I didn't feel like a gold member, even not like a customer.
I'm not sure how they train there staff, and I don't think this kind of service is acceptable anywhere else. Fine, I'll go, and of course never come back to any MGM resorts again.
