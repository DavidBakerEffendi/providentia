My husband and Mother went to this location tonight. The drive through took a very long time. They ordered a burger and 4 meals. When checking our order my husband saw that an order of shrimp was missing.  My husband parked the car and went to the window to ask for the missing order. The man did not believe my husband. He argued with him and said that he personally packed the order and everything was included. He followed him to the car , took everything out of the bag and placed it on the seat and then checked my husbands receipt. He obviously thought my husband was lying. After seeing that the order was missing he gave a quick apology and went to get the missing food. 
When they got home the food was only warm. The shrimp and fish are so heavily breaded you can't taste anything else. It's dry and the French fries are soggy. 
I will never go to this location again. The customer service is horrible and the food is terrible.
