I loved Los Gamelos' tacos.  I ordered their steak taco and chicken taco.  They are served wrapped with two corn tortillas and are precisely what I was hoping for.  The steak taco stole the show as it was stuffed full with tender meat, chopped onion, cilantro, and I poured their red hot sauce on it, as well...  

No sour cream, cheese only if you ask for it...  

I also ordered a side of beans and rice that I was very happy with...  

Only problem is I got a HORRIBLE case of food poisoning from it, was up from 1am until 2pm the next day basically having my guts removed and placed in the toilet..

Will never step foot in there again.
