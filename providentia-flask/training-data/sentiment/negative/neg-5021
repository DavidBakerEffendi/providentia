UnBEARable Service  & Food ..Yuk !  why did I ever go in that place, this was like a month ago...... I asked for OJ , we don't have any. My omelette came with Avocados , sorry no avocados... how a bout my wheat toast please? sorry , you want white ??  My Country Potatoes not cooked and half raw. My wife's hashbrown not cooked well . Wanted to get out of there , the waitress, it's like if we weren't there. She kept Yaking with her freind. Just a disaster.... i'm sorry, but no Black Bear for me ...ever !..
