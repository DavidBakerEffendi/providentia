first time i called this location the lady in the phone had a language barrier i had to hang up and call a different location and beg them to deliver to me. Tonight i called a second time and ordered. Hour later i called store asking if driver left and they said he did. 20 min after that phone call the driver calls me asking me where my building is. I told the driver he's a bad delivery driver if he can't find my building himself like use google maps what the hell.... anyways i end up calling the store again because the driver is taking forever to find my building. Finally the delivery arrives and i immediately notice my desert i ordered is not present. The driver leaves to go get it and again takes for ever like he must have parked far away even tho there's parking at my building. I notice during that time my pizza is not what i ordered and had a different address on the box. I call the store a third time and tell them. When the delivery driver arrives back at my door with my desert i give him the pizza back. The driver again leaves to his car and comes back with my cold ass pizza. I lie to the guy and tell him the store is giving me the pizza for free and close the door in his face. The guy calls the store and finds out i lied and knocks on my door repeatedly making my dogs bark. I don't answer as let's be real the order should be free. I later eat my cold pizza and notice this false advertisement on the box. HORRIBLE LOCATION TRY TO AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS!
