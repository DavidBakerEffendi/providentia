Well we read the reviews and decided as they were so mixed to give it a try.  BIG MISTAKE.
The staff out numbered the guests...they stood around in a group yelling and laughing with each other, totally oblivious to the noise they were making....all centered around the bar tender.  Needless to say there was no one at the bar.
The air conditioner was on, but someone said the door was to be open, so our food was buzzed by flies, throughout our dining experience.
Which brings me to the actual food......mashed potatoes, excellent but cold. Cheese biscuits....probably yesterdays or older, reheated to a dry crisp and then allowed to become cold. Now for the chicken......beautifully served, dry as a bone, tasteless, and certainly NOT just removed from a rotisserie. Sauces, watery and quite disgusting.  Service bad (our server smelled of sweat)
Plates and silverware very nice!
