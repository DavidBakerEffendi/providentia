What a terrible terrible place! We went here as a family to enjoy the food as a family. The food was Terrible! The potatoes were dry and hard as a rock. Some of them were burnt and dried out. I am not sure if they were left over or what happened but I have never seen potatoes cooked so bad. The spaghetti was mushy. We might as well have been eating baby food. The beef that they had on the buffet looked like pieces of leather. I should have taken pictures. Not only was all of the food absolutely disgusting but there was only one server for our entire family. As we try to enjoy our family meeting and continue eating the terrible food, people continue to stroll in off of the streets and pay the host to eat our buffet food. I would never recommend this place to anyone for any event. I am pretty sure there wasn't toilet paper and any stall in the bathroom and it was also disgustingly dirty. I'm so sorry that we had to waste our time there. We won't be making that mistake ever again!
