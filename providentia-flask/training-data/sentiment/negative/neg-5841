Dear Soup Nutsy,

You say your shops offer service "with less emphasis on cantankerousness and more on carefully prepared soups with a smile." Ummm...no. It was more like "NO SOUP FOR YOU!" There are staff who really are Soup Nazis.

I used to be a regular customer who would buy your breakfast soup at least 3 times a week on my way to the office. Unfortunately, I will not be going back because there are 2 staff members who tainting the otherwise pleasant experiences I have had there. Today at around 8:45 am I stopped by to buy a large beef bone broth. Usually it is a very friendly staff member of Vietnamese descent or another taller brown-haired guy or a lady with sandy brown hair usually in a ponytail who all happily assist me. Because the soups are scalding hot, I usually request and am given a double cup and a double cap. Because you don't offer coffee cup sleeves, the double cup insulates the heat and makes the cup manageable to carry as a have another 15 minutes of walking to reach work, climbing stairs etc. Without the double-cap, the scalding soup spills all over my hand as I walk and it burns or ends up staining my clothes. I've never had an issue until today. One of your staff, a female with burgundy red hair (who has been very rude in the past) told a short male staff member not to give me a double-cup and double-cap. When I requested these, he told me "I can't give these to you because it's wasting money." If you provided sleeves and a proper cap or cap plug, then I wouldn't need to request these things. I'm not about to have boiling soup spill all over me. It's a matter of customer safety and courteous customer service. I was made to feel like I was asking too much. I was so disappointed that I cancelled my order. I really loved your breakfast soups so this is unfortunate.

I hope you will rectify this for your remaining customers. I am sadly no longer one of them!
