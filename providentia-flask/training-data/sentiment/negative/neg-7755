I went to this place once before and enjoyed it (I had a second interview here). Maybe it was the fact that I was extremely hungry being out of work and needing a full meal or temporary insanity because when I went back today, that was not the case.

In short, here's what was wrong:

In our party of 8, the service was slow & not very attentive.  It took a long time for the food to come to the table. The food was not cooked as ordered, which was fixed but afterward, the food made us physically ill. We ate at 5 and still feeling the effects of the bad food at 12:20am.  I will probably never eat there again and I only had the lobster bisque which tasted nothing like lobster.
