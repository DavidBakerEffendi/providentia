Had to ask Manager and other servers for stuff, refills, condiments, silverware, etc. We ordered tea, steak, and fries with our meals. Server didn't bring sugar, steaksauce, or ketchup. Steak sauce cap looked nasty and dried on the cap, sugar in sugar daddy was hard and caddy was dirty. Didn't use the pepper because the top was nasty as well. Go to Yard House nearby!! Clean and friendly place, it never disappoints!!
