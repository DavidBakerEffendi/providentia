I preface this by stating I am half Vietnamese and almost every weekend I have Pho at my father's home. Nothing beats a homemade bowl of this beautiful broth, and I must admit that because I am spoiled with authenticity I tend to be a harsher critic.

At the same time, however, I do give most Vietnamese restaurants some slack. If you want good Pho, do not go to Dragonfly in Tempe. Please, please, please. Their bowl of Pho is incredibly small and they skimp majorly on the aromatics. Talk about a Pho foul. And what's with the shredded roast-like meat? Oh no, it's supposed to be circle wafers of rare beef. 

Instead, visit the Dragonfly in Mesa. That place rocks, and they have other authentic soups that the Tempe location does not have. Like the great soup, "mi"--that's egg-noodle-wonton heaven. The egg rolls are not good at either location, by the way. If you know the difference between Vietnamese "egg rolls" or chai gois, and the fat, cabbage filled Chinese egg roll, then you can imagine how disappointed I was when they brought me some egg roll hybrid with a gross sweet and sour sauce. 

I'm glad to see a Vietnamese place on campus, regardless. And if others love it, more power to them and I hope it keeps good little ethnic places like Dragonfly open. Just know that there is way better out there!
