Sorry to say but just horrible. Had the won ton chip n dips and they were greasy. Ask the waiter if the roll  I wanted really had real crab or fake krab ... She assured me it was real but guess what?! Krab ... Ick! The Thai beef salad was lackluster ... the greens soggy, the beef without flavor and chunky chewy slices ... So disappointed all around!
