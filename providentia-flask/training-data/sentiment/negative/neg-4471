I found a short black curly hair in my basket of fries... and it was definitely not mine.

Needless to say, this completely ruined my meal. Thanks to Peppi's, I won't be eating anything that isn't ready-to-eat as is (like fruit) for the next few days.

Not only does the shop LOOK grimey, it IS grimey... Completely disgusted.
