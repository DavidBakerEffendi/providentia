This buffet is horrible. It is a more asian inspired buffet in comparison to Mandarin or Dragon Pearl.

The foods here are similar to Mandarin, and comparable in the variety to some degree. The restaurant even has a teppanyaki area that lets you make a stir-fry fresh, sirloin steak, and other seafood.

The biggest problems with the restaurant is the layout and food quality. The restaurant is a larger buffet, so it allows for more people in there, and more space to move. That hinders this buffet because the food is spread out in weird places and you can't find what you want. As well, the food is mass produced to a larger extent since it accommodates to larger number of consumers. All the dishes I tried were horrible, and the one gimmick of the teppanyaki was bland and disappointing.

The teppanyaki area leaves raw meat out in the open, and one can only suppose what germ filled hands and young children can do to that.

There is also free bottled water and free fountain drinks on the side, but honestly it takes very minimal charge to supply soft drinks.

I wouldn't go back.
