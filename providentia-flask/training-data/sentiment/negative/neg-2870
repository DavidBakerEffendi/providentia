Took my girlfriend out for date night. We were actually trying to go to "Superior Pho" next door, but mistook "#1 Pho" for "Superior Pho." (It was like a movie scene, you should have seen it) Waitress was too distracted trying to impress the other waiter. My girlfriend and I were too distracted from enjoying our time to shoo all of the flies away from our heads and food. The food was decent, the bubble tea was good. After I complained about the flies, the waitress and waiter came out with two fly swatters and attempted to kill the flies (very loudly) Funny, yes, but hardly an enjoyable date night atmosphere. Get it together Faux Pho!
