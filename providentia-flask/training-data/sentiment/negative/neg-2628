Talk about alienating a certain segment of the population. I visited my cousin in Pittsburgh and she thought it might be cool to go Cuban (our heritage) so she looked up this place. We took one look at the menu and walked out. Naming something a Che burger is like going to a Jewish deli and having a Hitler/Himmler sandwich. I don't care how good the food may be, it's ignorant. Of course, maybe they don't want anyone who had to flee Cuba (or their relatives) in there. I hope the Bacardi Bros. don't sell their fine products there. And yes, I joined Yelp just so I could point that out. I only wish I knew someone who could muster up a crowd to picket this joint. At least we have plenty of Facebook friends in the area.
