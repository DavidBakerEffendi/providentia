Tried to speak to the manager on departure and have emailed complaint 3x times now with no response at all. Very disappointing! Found used women's swimwear still in the room on arrival. Urine stains around the toilet on arrival. Hot tub was dirty and unusable and still wet. No iron and hair dryer at all in the entire hotel and we were going to a wedding. No a/c remote so were freezing cold. Hotel is old and tired and I would 100% NOT recommend staying there! Ross Voorhees 05.24.18
