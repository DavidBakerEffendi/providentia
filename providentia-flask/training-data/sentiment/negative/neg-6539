This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. It got one star because of the wine and I brought my own. Never have I ever experienced terrible service like this. Our server Katie was "annoyed" to open our wine, take our order and had a terrible attitude. our reservation was at 8:15....oh we are still here waiting for food! Pathetic.
