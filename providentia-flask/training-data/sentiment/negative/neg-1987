5 thumbs down for this Hictory Tavern location!!!! First of all the waitress was rude to  the customers. She was loud and argumentative with some guys standing next to me. Secondly, my food was not cooked properly and I "thought" the waitress was bringing  back a whole new entree.  Nope..she returned my same "picked over" burger back to me fully cooked. ( Major food violation) Finally you would think the store manager  ( Tom Blake)  would be trained to handle any/all store issues right? Sad to say.. Tom's way of dealing with a overcrowded restaurant is to call the police and LIE by saying... folks are  causing trouble  and refusing to leave the restaurant. ( Not true!) I sat at my table and watched the whole incident. Those guys was not causing trouble nor refusing to leave! Anyways, I can go on and on about how awful this location treats customers! Honestly, I almost thought the staff was drunk that night! Because I have NEVER seen this type of behavior/crazyness from a restaurant.
