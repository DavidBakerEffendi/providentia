I am a well known food critic who travels the Western United States in search of Cajun restaurants who either are cajun restaurants or are pretending to be.
On May 29, 2011 I visited the Cajun Seafood Corner with an associate, only to find that the restaurant was sparsely patronized. In spite of this fact my associate and I proceeded into the establishment.
What we noticed was that the restaurant truly epitomizes what a true (hole in the wall) New Orleans restaurant looks like. I took this as a sign of good things to come, as New Orleans Holes in the wall in spite of their hole in the wall condition, most often offer fantastic foods as opposed to flair. 
We opened the evening with an order of Michelob original for myself, and Bud light for my associate, along with 2 pounds of their "All In" crawfish as this is the perfect matchup to boiled crawfish (the signature dish)  which was the (street side advertised) special offering. 
When the order arrived (after 10 minutes) the crawfish was hot as expected, but upon the (taste test), we found the peppery flavor to be dominated by Tabasco as the main ingredient and the signature dish lacked salt.
My associate and I decided to take in our next, and what turned to be our final course of the evening, that being the Cajun Seafood corners, SAMPLER plate.
When the sampler plate arrived the plate consisted of ; Fried Okra, Fried Catfish, Fried Potatoes, Fried Calamari, Fried chicken.
The one problem was, (and this is the DEAD GIVEAWAY) the potateos were stuck from frying to the calamari. Golden rule, DO NO FRY POTATOES WITH OTHER FOODS, AS THE POTATO PICKS UP THE TASTE OF THE OTHER FOODS FRIED WITH THEM!
When all is considered,a diner will  (without a doubt) base their opinion (on the fly) off of the sampler plate.
To make matters worse, the food was either overcooked from being frozen before frying, or the shortening was rancid. For the sake of those who may choose to patronize, I hope the shortening was rancid this day.
Oh, I did call the owner to voice my displeasure with the food and essentially after notification of my status,  was told to F%*K  OFF, because he felt I was holding HIM HOSTAGE, but in retrospect HE ACTUALLY WAS HOLDING ME HOSTAGE TO HIS POOR CUISINE AND KNOWLEDGE AS HE OPENLY ADMITTED WHEN ASKED BY ANOTHER PATRON WHERE HIS GATOR CAME FROM, HIS RESPONSE WAS "I DON"T KNOW, IT COMES FROZEN. He either does not care or he cannot read the shipping labels.!!!!!!!!!!!!
