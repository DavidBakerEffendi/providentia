Had a wonderful time at the Elton John performance and couldn't get a table at Mesa Grill so we decided to give this place a try.
BIG mistake. Nothing we ate was worth mentioning and the waitress was slow. The only thing I asked for was a refill of soda and had to ask a second time 20 minutes later. No wonder this place is closing!!
We could have had a delicious meal at Norton's or Lawry's for the same price.
