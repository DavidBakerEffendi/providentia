This is my family's second visit to O'Charley's in the last three or so months....while my family enjoys the reasonable prices and decent food, the service is HORRIBLE! 
Today we arrived about 6:15 and was immediately seated, we ordered our drinks which came relatively quick and our server, who I won't name because he was nice... nice AND slow, said there was four minutes on the rolls, which was no problem as we needed a few minutes to review the menu, he took his time and finally came back for our order... It was now 6:36, 20 minutes no rolls and when I asked, he said they were coming...ok?!?!? But he then sent another gentlemen in a suit who also informed us they were waiting for hot rolls, at which time my husband asked if they were waiting on a hot salad... as more than time had passed since we ordered our food. The salad came, the rolls and piece by piece our  entrees came out.  Unfortunately our waiter did not ever come to check on us once our food finally came to the table and we had to ask other tables for condiments. 
The food was fine and when we were done our waiter made his way over... Plates stacked up he did retrieve the Togo container I requested but never cleared a dish or brought the check. The mgr started to clear dishes and was informed of the slowest service ever which was a repeat of our last visit. He apologized and attributed it to an off night. 
After another 5 minutes or so the server brings the check. The bill gets squared away and I ask for change to leave a tip...the wait continued... 
Yes, I left a tip but NO, I will not return to this O'Charley's ever!!!!
