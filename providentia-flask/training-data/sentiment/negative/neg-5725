If there was less then one star that's what this place would get.... It's horrible don't waste your time or money!! Ordered the white pizza its was very very salty. We each had one piece and tossed the rest. Jalape√±o were okay we ate those. Then we got a slice of tiramisu it was frozen! And got the balalaika and it was stale. It was the worse meal I have ever bought!! I will say the delivery drive was very nice. 40$ not well spent!!
