Going down hill fast and signs of stopping! Sorry I have not reviewed this joint sooner. I have been going to Deemo's since they first opened at the Esplanade. The food and the service used to be fantastic! The Portabello mushroom burger was my fav! Now they can't get nothin right. 

The last time I had the burger it was different they swear its the same meat and everything but my taste buds don't lie. This burger was awful, maybe even freezer burnt. The huge mushroom was the best part. 

I tried the Philly cheese recently and um I really to prefer to have meat on my sandwich! This was the sorriest Philly steak ever! Barely to bites of meat all bread and not good bread either! 

Their crab cakes are awesome but the last time I got those they were under cooked and had bits of shell in them YUCK! 

Today I ordered eggs over medium and crisp bacon. I got eggs over easy and under cooked precooked bacon that was so thin you could see through! All this for 6.17! Plus tax! This is bad eggs and really bad bacon! YUCK!

Don't bother dropping in here for the free app unless you go for the crab cakes and then leave. Just not what they used to be and it just keeps getting worse.

Also on a side bar the service has gone way down hill to. The servers are not very bright here at least the ones I have come across over the past couple years.
