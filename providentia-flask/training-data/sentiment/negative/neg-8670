Horrible place and service in many ways.............dirty, dirty, dusty all over the place.  The ceiling fans were so thick with dirt that it was like looking at a cob web all over.  The dust would set off an allergy attack in a healthy person!  I had purchased a Living/Social pkg for a gel nail mani/pedicure.  It took over 5 days for them to schedule. The nail tech was very pleasant, but the best part was the pedicure, however, she had no clue about gel nails and soaked mine off and attempted to apply new ones with color gel polish. It looked as if a 5 year old did the nails. I went back the next day, asked for the manager and also called her 2 times, but no return calls, when I went back, the nail tech was not in and I should another person there my nails. She was a dizzy rude chick with ugly blonde hair who had no finesse about anything, not to mention customer service. This place should be closed down by the Health District due to the filthy dirt/dust and to the improper sanitation  as evidenced by the old dirty looking foot wash machines.  It should be reported to the Better Business Bureau for their poor customer service.
