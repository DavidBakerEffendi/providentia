I've had the pizza here once and it was decent compared to the generic triad (papa, dom, and the hut) unfortunately they seem determined to keep me from trying their pizza again, living only a mile or two away from this place we always get coupons for them on our door handle and they are generally pretty good deals, unfortunately everytime I call for delivery fate intervenes and decides I should eat somewhere else.

the first time I called no one answered, the second time I tried someone picked up and put me on hold to eventually hang up on me, to call back to be put back on hold to never get my call answered, I want to eat your pizza but I don't see why you won't answer your phone to take my order.
