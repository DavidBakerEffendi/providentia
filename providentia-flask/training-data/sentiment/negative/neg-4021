Ugh. Being a student at UNCC, I rarely venture to the South Park area. For my 21st birthday all I wanted to do was eat at the infamous Cheesecake Factory. We went around 3ish so the wait was only about 5minutes. 

Being my 21st I kind of expected for the server to at least notice when I got carded and ordered drinks that it was my birthday and he didn't. The drinks were good though. My boyfriend told the server as he passed by that I was a little hurt and the climatic moment I had been waiting for was ruined and he admitted that he only checked the year. 

Overall the food was meh. I got the steak Diane and shrimp scampi with mashed potatoes. They must pre plate the potatoes when you get the combinations because it turned into a molded shape in the middle. The shrimp and steak were bleh and I can't even complain that I only received 3 shrimps and 3 steak medallions because they weren't very good. Boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken and it was fatty. He said it was alright but the menu says it comes with a plantain. They had a grilled banana on it- maybe they expect people to not know the difference? 

Cheesecake was very good though. 

I will never be visiting again. The server did the bare minimum. We left spending $115 including tip but the boyfriend was charged $121. Even though it's $6, that's sketchy. Boyfriend called the manager and the manager said to call his bank because he saw that we were charged $115 but he had to keep explaining that he was over charged. I work at a restaurant and the boyfriend has a chef for a brother so we both are familiar with the service industry and I will never eat at a place with servers bold enough to readjust tips that have a manager that could care less.
