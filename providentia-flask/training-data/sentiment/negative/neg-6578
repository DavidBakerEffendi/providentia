Well I was excited about visiting this caf√©, considering how cute and tucked away it is. After walking down into the cafe, I wasn't greeted by anyone. That's fine sometimes during busy times anywhere someone can be overlooked. 

I proceeded to walk around as it's rather small, just to see if I could set up my computer. I'm a freelance contract worker so it's usually pretty important to me that I be able to work and enjoy the restaurant. I'd already saw that there was Xfinity wifi available, so the only other thing I needed was an outlet. Since no one still had greeted or tried to engage me to help, I looked around. I made contact with a younger woman with an apron on, signaling to me she worked there, but after she didn't speak or rely to my southern head nod, I moved on. After finding an outlet I turned around to find help and understand seating. I saw someone set a table so I knew there had to be a host somewhere. Before I could, that same young woman who passed on saying hello or trying to help earlier, decide to speak after all. She asked where I was going, and I explained to her that I was just checking on available outlets and wifi to see if this would be a place where I could work and eat. Instead of helping she made the snarky comment that I couldn't sit there, although I wasn't sitting anywhere, and that there's a host and I needed to find him and wait for him to find me a seat. 

I decided then that this wasn't the type of environment for me, so I let her know that she didn't answer my question or concerns about outlets and wifi and based off her unwelcoming demeanor and disregard to talk with me, I'd just find somewhere else. And I did right down the street. I was disappointed because it was such a charming place with a seemingly awesome menu, but I still believe quality customer service is important. All I could do was hope that race had nothing to do with how cold and rude she was. 

Maybe another time it'll work it, I'll ask a friend to let me know.
