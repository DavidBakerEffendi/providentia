This is probably my worst poke experience. My boyfriend and I ordered a signature poke bowl and sensai sushi burrito. I ate my poke bowl in the store and my boyfriend got it to go. The portion size for the fish was "hilarious". This is more like a veggie bowl and a few pieces of fish here and there. The tuna and salmon werent very fresh anyways so i guess thank god they only gave me a few pieces so i dont get food poisoning? ‍Go to mihito sushi lab for better quality and bigger portions.

Service was even more hilarious than the food itself. I wish i can give it -5 stars. There was three chinese girls working in the store and we were the only customers. It took them 10 mins to make the burrito? So i went to the cashier to see whats up. One of the newer girl (according to their conversation) was shook when i found out she was playing with her phone this whole time. In fact all of them were playing with their phones but her expression when i went up to her was just priceless‍ oh and when we left, no goodbye, no thankyou for coming, just three chinese girls on their phones
