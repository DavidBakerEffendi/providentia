I am not from the area and I've never had a Hero Burger, so maybe my expectations are off.  I ended up here because I was staying at the hotel next door, traffic looked awful, and it was one of a few options in walking distance.  The ad out front looked good...

I can say that the person working there seemed friendly.  I don't know if she was an employee or proprietor, but she was very polite.

As for the food....it was just not good.  The bread is not fresh.  And the meat feels like a pre-frozen patty that was heated up in a microwave.  And I say "feels like" because I could feel it.  It had a strange texture in my mouth.  At no point did I feel like I was eating a ground beef patty.  It just felt like a weird, rubbery solid.
