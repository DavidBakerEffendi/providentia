Since my previous review last year, I've eaten at Haps quite a few more times.  After lunch today (a coworker insisted we go there), I think it's finally time to reduce this to one star.

Why?

Well, in short, it's because they cut every corner they can find.  I've already mentioned the terrible side dishes.  The flavorless mashed potatoes, the garlic-less garlic toast, etc.  The buns they use are terrible; it's dry, spongy, and completely flavorless.  The scoop of ice cream they put on top of the cobbler (which they charge you about $1.50 for) is that yellow garbage you get in those five gallon buckets labeled "frozen dairy dessert product."

And perhaps most indicative of their overall cheapness, they replaced the Henry Weinhard's root beer with that plastic bottled A&W crap some time last year.  Yes, I can tell the difference, and yes, that move alone cost them my business.

For the record, my lunch today (a pulled pork sandwich, a cup of cobbler with a scoop of ice cream, and a cup of water) cost me almost $12.  With a drink, that would have been $14.  For low quality food, those prices are unacceptable.

I guess people in Arizona like this garbage.  If someone tells you this place has good food, you can rest assured they either have no taste buds or actually like bad food.
