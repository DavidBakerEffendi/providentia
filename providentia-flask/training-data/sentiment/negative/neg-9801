I usually don't eat fast food, nor do I buy it. However today my son asked me to get him Burger King. So I went by there. I asked Wendy what comes on there bacon cheese burger. She replied by saying the same thing that comes on the cheeseburger, except with bacon. I have no idea what comes on the cheeseburger there because I don't eat fast food. I don't appreciate her poor attitude, and I'm sorry I was asking too much of her to tell me what comes on the cheeseburger. Maybe Wendy needs to get a different job where she does not have to interact with customers. I won't be going back there EVER
