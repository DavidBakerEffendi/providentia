We came on a Friday and the store said that they would open at 2pm however they did not open till 2:15pm

We get in and the waitress was rude. We sat ourselves. And when we went to order I went to order a Tofu dessert with fresh fruit and ice cream. However the lady informs me that they do not have tofu till 5pm at night. 

So then I go to order a Sea coconut ice mix, and apparently they don't do mixed desserts before 5pm

Now someone tell me what is the point of opening at 2pm if nothing is available. It takes over 20mins for them to bring any food out. 

The dessert is ok here but nothing special that I can't get somewhere else. I would suggest that they retrain the staff and maybe state on the menu that nothing is available before 5pm

Won't come back here again.
