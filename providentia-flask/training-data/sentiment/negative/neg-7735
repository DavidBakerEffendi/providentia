Normally we enjoy Texas Roadhouse.  Unfortunately today must have been the wrong day to go.  We ordered two steaks and sides.  One was requested to be medium well and was brought out as  charred dry charcoal.  The other was requested to be medium rare and had only a sliver of red down the center.  Both where pretty flavorless ass well.  They did offer to cook new ones but after waiting forever for the first two we where not interested.  To top it off my son (whom I was trying to get to finish his salad) proceeds to take a bite of salad then pull a long black hair outta his mouth.  Needless to say he wouldn't finish the salad.  The response from the waiter, oh sorry about that, have a nice day.....
