Went to go for lunch today. Most of the street was closed ( there was a power line down) so it wasn't busy. We had a stroller with us wth a sleeping baby and two toddlers. Other strollers were already in there. The server said we couldn't come in as she wouldn't have room to work. She claimed ours was too wide ( for reference it was a Bugaboo donkey in single mode, couple of inches bigger then the uppababy I could see in there. We have both strollers so I'm very sure if this). We were discussing it at the front and she came by again and pretty rudely said, see this is what I mean, I need to use this space ( she could have just said excuse me). Pity as we live in the neighbourhood and thought this would be a good place for regular lunches after the kids football, but I can't stand this kind of poor attitude. If it had been a seriously busy day with multiple strollers fine, but this was just clearly something they need to work on in a family restaurant.
