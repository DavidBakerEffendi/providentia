WEDDINGS BEWARE!!! So we have been in contact with the wedding coordination group since January 17th 2012, planning our wedding from away as we live in Ohio, letting them know our plans to be out in AZ the last week in March and planned on getting together to discuss in person. When we got there, the girl in particular was very stand offish and by NO MEANS put a personal touch on the planning. She stood on the patio and pointed where we'd be at for our wedding and did not even have the courtesy to go down to the lawn to show us options for rehearsal and set up. We asked if we could decorate, and we got the comment of "you can decorate a little, very minimal, but NOTHING that would distract our dinner guests" SO...it is very apparent that they care more about disturbing their guests that people planning for their ceremony. We actually had additional people there and received comments from them saying "It felt as if you needed to be careful to fit into their world and to be sure not to inconvenience them" Already bothered by this, we decided to still go through with it has we had exchanged 20+ emails with them, and thought we were in to deep as it was. When we received the contact, there was a 100% PRICE INCREASE!! I immediately emailed them back ad received the "amount of effort, set-up and landscaping costs we incur.  We had some issues at the start of the year that have caused us to raise our pricing.  And we reserve the right to increase pricing" I abruptly asked" in the 20+ emails you could not have let us know this" and we got the ever so nice response of ".  We communicate with hundreds of people each day and we cannot keep track of who has the most current information if it's something we emailed a while ago" REALLY?? REALLY?? Needless to say I was threw with them, and decided to take our wedding party elsewhere. PLEASE feel free to get ahold of me and I will tell you a location where PEOPLE ACTUALLY CARE!!
