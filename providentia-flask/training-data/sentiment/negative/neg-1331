Maybe had I come an hour earlier I could have experienced why this place had so many good reviews. Unfortunately all I experienced were some mighty overpriced tacos filled with cold dried out beef along side some mediocre rice and beans. On the flip side had I come 10 minutes later I could have had the reheated beef I watched get dumped from the steamer tray onto the grill for about 4 minutes and scraped back into the container.

Place could use a cleaning and service was as cold as my tacos.

Avoid this place.
