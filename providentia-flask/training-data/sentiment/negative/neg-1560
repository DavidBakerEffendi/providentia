I was so excited to come here as I have been born and raised in Wisconsin was happy to find a packer bar as I had just moved to Arizona. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar received poor service, never was asked for refill or another drink, took about 40 minutes to get our dinner order and about 15 minutes for our boxes for food since I wanted to just go home and watch the packer game streamed online. Yes, it's preseason and I understand that not every broadcast has it but if you are a PACKER bar shouldn't you have ALL the games?!?! Frustrating... I had a lot of hopes especially moving from Wisconsin but might need to find another pack bar.
