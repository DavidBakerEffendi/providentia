I personally wouldn't recommend this.  It is really expensive, and you initially think it is not until they tell you that they are Tapas style servings of the food, and even then it is not really enough to feed people.  I thought it was really overpriced and didnt think the food was that good.  I had a sushi roll and it was just mediocre and cost around 30.00.  I think that with all the restaurants on the Strip, you would be better off skipping this place.
