Came in here after seeing a flyer in the neighborhood. Completely disappointed. Came hungry and left hungry after a $16 lunch. Three meatballs that were mushy, tomatoes soup cup was tiny and spicy and olives and one piece of toast. Hubby got a shrimp tapas with three shrimp and two slivers of pineapple for $13. 

I would have looked past the prices maybe if the food was amazing. But the service was very poor. Why do people work in a bar but act as if they don't like people? Very short attitude and unfriendly. When I asked a question it was as if I was bothering her. 

Not coming back. Save your money.
