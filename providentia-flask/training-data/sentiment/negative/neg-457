Horrible place.  This bar/restaurant could be so much more, but the surly employees and their laissez-faire (for you Ryan's employees reading this, that means 'I couldn't give a damn') attitude just seals the deal:  I'll never set foot in this place again.

Add to their attitude, and the mediocre food, the fact that their "patio," where all the windows were closed tonight, was filthy with smoke.  When I questioned the self-designated queen behind the bar about this, she asked why I was "so angry."  Well, that comment practically lead my mouse to the Allegheny County Smoking Violation Report website, needless to say.

It's a shame that a place such as this still exists; clearly it draws from beyond the actual Regent Square neighborhood, where tastes are obviously not so discriminating.
