I used to love this place...last year...when it was under different ownership. Since the change the quality and service has significantly gone down. 

I ordered take out for myself and 3 coworkers. They told me due to the lunch rush it would take 40 minutes. I went at that time and to my surprise they said they had given my order to someone else. I understand that mistakes happen so I waited patiently for them to make my order again. It took them 50 minutes to remake my order and all they said was sorry and gave me a 15% off my next order coupon. 

When I went today I asked if they would change 1 roll in a combo since I am pregnant and can't eat raw fish (salmon roll to a unagi roll). They said no and made me order each roll separately...which is the same amount of effort but more expensive. 

Will not be returning here. Hopefully they change ownership again soon!
