I hate that i am writing a one star review but for this location its a must. I have been a long time Archi's fan back years and years when they first started here in Las Vegas. 
Everytime I seem to come to this location either the food is bad or the service is bad. 

Today for our lunch break my boyfriend and I decided to give this place another try. Bad idea.  I walked in and got seated by some server who seemed to have an attitude. We waited about 20 minutes before we were greeted by a busser asking what we wanted to drink. We asked her to order food as well and she told us she had to get our server.
15 minutes later finally a server came over and took our order. The food took forever to come out but the food was actually good though. The whole process took an hour and a half which in my opinion is very lengthy not to mention IT MADE ME LATE BACK TO WORK! 

Of course, when it came time to pay they were super fast on picking up my credit card.

The sad part was we werent the only table that was complaining.
