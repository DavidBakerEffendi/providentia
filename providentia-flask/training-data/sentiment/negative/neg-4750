Delivery took an hour and we live 5 minutes away.  The menu CLEARLY states that plates come with 2 sides.  Guy on the phone asks "Do you want fries and rice" I say yes but with potatoes instead of fries.  Order arrives with no rice.  I call back and guy gets arrogant and says it is my fault and I ordered only potatoes.  I didn't want to waste time with him so I said next time i'll just order from marathon's.  And the food was not even good.  Never again!
