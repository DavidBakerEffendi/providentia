We (stupidly) came back in hopes that MAYBE we could enjoy Taco Tuesday.  Never again. I ordered the Mahi Tacos off the gluten free menu. They came with a slaw like topping (cabbages and carrots) and tomatoes. I'm allergic to carrots and tomatoes.  The gluten free menu and no descriptions (my fault for not asking) so I just picked them off. My complaint about the tacos were that they were ice cold, dry, and honestly tasted how I imagine an armpit would taste. I had 1 bite and couldn't finish.  Our waitress comes back, clearly sees that I haven't eaten and doesn't ask if everything is OK.  Usually if a customer comes in and only has 1 bite of the meal and doesn't get a to-go box SOMETHING is wrong. She seemed like she didn't care about it at all. The margarita pitcher was weak again. We stopped at the grocery store after dinner so I  could actually eat. After this we are definitely NOT coming back here again.
