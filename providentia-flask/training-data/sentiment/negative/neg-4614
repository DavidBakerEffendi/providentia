If there was 0 stars i would give this place that. food and service here is so terrible. the chef whoever she or he is needs to go back to a culinary institution to relearn how to be a chef. the food was so salty. we had the shrimp fried rice, chicken pad Thai, crying tiger and chicken curry. the curry was the most Salty of them. cant even eat it. we came to vegas and it was so disappointing. Even food at the Strip and i paid lots of money was terrible. that why i went on groupon to give the locals a try. i ended up with a terrible stomach ache. my overall suggestion is stay clear of this place! Service was so slow and there is an old lady trying to help them she doesn't understand english either so asking for napkin or anything should she would go back and another lady would translate for her so it took even longer. this was Thursday, today and lunch time and lots of people waiting for their to go orders and check.  people in Vegas lack flavors. Im so glad I'll back to OC as the food there is excellent and better service than vegas
