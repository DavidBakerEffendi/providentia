I'm not in the business of giving a 1, but this experience deserved it. 

The meals: I ordered the Benedict trio w/o the hollandaise sauce and a side of hash browns. The Benedict came w hollandaise and the hash browns never came. The pork Benedict wasn't cooked and when the hash browns came (after I asked) it was a square hash brown, which tasted like a microwaveable hash brown. 
My brother is gluten free and he ordered an omelet, which was good, but the potatoes were over seasoned and flat. He did say the gluten free bread was better than most. 
Coffee was good. 
The cost: 2 breakfasts and coffee $70 including tip. 
The service: The service was terrible. We sat for 15 minutes with our plates empty before our waitress came back (of course without the check)
There is an allergy menu for all, but go elsewhere.
