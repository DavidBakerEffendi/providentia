Unfortunately the experience was sadly very but very disappointing. Food was not even deserving of one star. But needed to put one to post. The short ribs where gelatinous and season less. The fried rice was as unpleasant. To the point we did not even take the excess leftover home. Can't understand why this place has 4 stars. Thank
