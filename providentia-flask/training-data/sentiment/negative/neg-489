Was excited to come here because we love Fuego Bistro...very disappointed. The person who greeted us at front door was very nice which was probably the best part of the dinner. Extremely loud and bad karaoke on Saturday night (you are warned!). I ordered the carne asada tacos with black beans and rice and my friend ordered the carne asada chimichanga. We got our order 2 minutes later which should have been a sign right there. It tasted like it had been microwaved. The carne asada was dry, the rice was cold and the beans were warm. Same for my friend's meal. I couldn't finish mine, it had no flavor. It took us longer to get our bill than it did our meal!  I was so disappointed.
