New spot on my side of town decided why not let me try it out..

Well coming into the restaurant few days after they open and it does not look like it's ready for opening. Decor and restaurant still looks a little bare. No music or anything on so conversations are a little awkward to have when everyone can hear.. Restaurant not ready for opening. On top of that owners not here one of the main reasons smaller restaurants like this fail. Still decided to try the food.

So I go in and look at the menu restaurant style is teriyaki madness-ish. Prices are restaurant range. Beef shrimp combo 16$ for a pretty small portion. Twice the price for half the food at Panda Express or teriyaki madness which are the closest comparable restaurants. Two entrees and two drinks 40$. 

Still I don't like to write negative reviews and wasn't going to if it weren't for the lack of service and wait time. I then decided to politely return a meal I took a bite out of since it completely tasted like pepper (beef yakisoba) and had to wait 25 minutes to try and return it. A lot of people waiting long wait times for orders.


Wouldn't go back. I always try to find the good in places and be as optimistic as possible but this restaurant just didn't do it for me.

The kids working there and the girl taking our order were sweet and tried but we're just inexperienced not there fault .

Below average food. Restaurant is not ready to be opened. Slow service. Don't worry you're not missing anything by not stopping here. Who knows maybe they get better and improve in the future..
