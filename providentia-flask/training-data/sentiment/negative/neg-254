Very very very slow service. Staff was not friendly. They couldn't take credit / debit cards. Buying a gift card was a huge ordeal. Not a pleasant experience at all. Not to mention getting into Downtown Summerlin is a nightmare. One way in and out. Stop sign at entrance backs everything up onto the main road.
