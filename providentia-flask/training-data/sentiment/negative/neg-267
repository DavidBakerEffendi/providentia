Have had better experiences at other Sam Woo locations in California. We ordered roasted pork with rice and beef chow fun with black bean sauce. While the food was served quickly, the rice was lukewarm, the chow fun noodle dish was bland and the rice noodles did not seem fresh. The dishes were pricier compared with other Sam Woo BBQ Restaurants and other restaurants in the Chinatown area. Also, the service was not very attentive, and our table, seats, and window nearby were not very clean. 

Will most likely not return - there are better Chinese restaurants in the area!
