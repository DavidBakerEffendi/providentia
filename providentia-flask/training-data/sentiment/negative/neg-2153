PERMANENTLY CLOSED!

Unfortunately, the Amigo's at Fiesta Henderson has followed the demise of its sister restaurant at Sunset Station, and closed-down as of October 2017.

The food was generally pretty good, the chips & salsa bar were great, but as someone who dined there several times a month over the past couple years, it was obvious over the past year or so that other than the 5PM rush, there just wasn't enough business to sustain operations.     In retrospect, it seemed like for the final couple weeks, servers were aware that the end was near.

Hate to see it go, but the reality is there are many other good to great Mexican restaurants around, and I'm eager to see what restaurant concept eventually fills the space that Amigo's occupied.   I thought the Mexican restaurant was a good fit for both Fiesta Henderson & Sunset Station, but apparently I was wrong.   

Hopefully the space won't be filled with more slot machines!
