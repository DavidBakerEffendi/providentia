Bummer that the review is solely based on the service. Totally understand that it is hard to find staff, but wow. Placed the order in the drive thru and the reply was "4 minute wait". Um, well, ok. I can wait. Then tons of garbled words came out and I had to ask them to repeat them selves 5 times until I got a "pull to the window". Wow. Total bummer.and after all that....my order was wrong.
