I should know better and to read Yelp reviews first! I am in the habit of wanting to post positive reviews for a place, not negative ones.

I ordered from here via Uber Eats because I had a busy work-from-home morning, and it was first on the list. I ordered the California Benedict and the French Toast. The latter was solid. The former, however, had one completely overcooked egg (including a photo) AND one poached (still a bit overcooked) but with eggshell!

Now, I wasn't planning on posting at that point. Just wanted to call the restaurant and let them know about their mistake so they won't do it to someone else. 

Made the call, put on hold because busy. No problem. Told hostess who picked up who then got the manager. I tell her what I just told ya'll: overcooked eggs, eggshell. 

Manager (in dismissive tone): "We don't give refunds, go back to Uber Eats"
Me: "Um, that's not even why I'm calling. I just want to let you know so it doesn't happen again. Maybe let the cook know?"
Manager: "..."

That was it! 
No taking of responsibility, no "I'm so sorry!"
No "What can we do for you?"
No offering of an action to take to do better next time. 

THAT is when I decided to write this. That kind of attitude is not conducive whatsoever. Mistakes happen. I can forgive that. Being dismissive when you are caught in a mistake in managing a business like this is problematic. 

Never again. Do better, please.
