Ultra disappointed. Very  poorly ventilated place.  There were just two tables, we waited  almost  40 minutes to be served with our food.  Please is not clean.  Doesn't matter what you tell them about your order,  they follow their same  script.  I ordered extra juice omelette,  said  about  EXTRA JUICY five  times. My omelette came  not only  totally  dry,  but  crumbled in  bit and  pieces,  and  even  the meat inside was totally overcooked.  I had to  really  dig in my with knife to cut through the omelette and really  chew through it.  I have  nerve  had to eat omelettes the  way.  I had also asked to  swap out the  toast and fries.  Server offered tomato slices instead and I agreed.  But  when my  food arrived,  it didn't come with any of that. When  asked about my sides,  she  said it should  come  with  fries and  roast,  to which  I reminded her of the  tomato slices. She  the asked if I wanted  tomato  slices instead.  Hello??!!!! Was I not  speaking  English?  I have up on the omelette,  gave it back,  and  asked for  a house salad instead,  to play safe.  The menu said the it had croutons,  blue cheese abs  stuff in it.  It came  with lettuce,  tomato chunks,  red pepper,  cucumber and  onions.  I give  up.  Not  going to ask for my blue cheese cos,  like  I said,  no  matter  what  you  say,  or what the menu  says,  they  follow their own  script.  The pancake didn't  come with butter,  was very dry,  and it had cinnamon powder on it!!  I was totally not happy with my order and  the served asked the  talked next to your vote they liked their food.  A d I agree with others here, that this place  badly needs a rent.
