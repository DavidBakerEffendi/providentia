This is by far one of the worst restaurant services that I have had. There's a disorganization in th whole kitchen, my party and I have been waiting over 3 hours now for our food, and the worst of all is the appetizers have t even come in either. They have been giving us one plate of food per hour. People have been coming in and out with their plates and we just keep being forgotten. I hope this restaurant reorganizes their standards in the quality of service that they provide.
