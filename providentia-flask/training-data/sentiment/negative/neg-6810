Went in early on Saturday, really wanting some hazelnut coffee before work. There weren't that many people (2 in line being helped) when I walked in and it took forever for them to get their stuff together and ring out a coffee. I counted 8 staff members - more than customers by far. Finally went to fill my coffee and had a feeling it would be out based on the brew time (about an hour before). Sure enough, got 1/3 cup before it ran out. I let them know it was out and they started calling for someone from the back while there were numerous staff members out front. They called for this person twice and I decided it wasn't worth the wait. Never wanted my $1.98 back more than this morning! Will take the few extra minutes to go somewhere else.
