Jacky Chan stars in horrible Chinese food. Panda Express is more authentic than you! I will admit the employees are friendly. But that's about all the Kudos you're getting from me. Overpriced mediocre food. Wait I take this back! Panda Express is mediocre but bearable! This is just below that! I have never seen lemon or sweet and sour chicken like theirs ever. It kinda looked like an empanadas covered in sauce. It's not even crispy. Now perhaps it was crispy out of the fryer but once its covered in the warm sauce it turns into a soggy mush. The flied lice tastes just like it sounds. I kinda feel bad because the service was good. And I wish them the best. Go to Spring Mountain (Chinatown) and get some tips because you have a prime location in the Southwest area that could be very profitable. But even though you're across the street Jackie you will never be invited to my home again.
