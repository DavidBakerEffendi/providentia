I am writing this review for my wife. She had lunch there last week with our daughter and grand daughter. They were celebrating a birthday. She said it was the worst food she ever had served to her. There were 2 Kale salads, the Kale was so tough a horse could not chew it and it was drowning in Prickly Pear Vinaigrette @ $16.00 each and there was no meat?? kind of pricey for a joint like this. The Cobb salad was below par again way to much dressing. There was no one in the place and now she knows why. To bad such a nice looking place
