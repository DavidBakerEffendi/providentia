Had the sweet and sour combo, this place is not for me  when I got home its was soggy - the fired rice with chicken had some pale chicken on it looked so white and unseason it looked like pork and looked like uncooked chicken- everyone else likes it people who go there drive from far apparently not sure why- go to China chilli it's x 10 better - oh had crab puff they had some almost custard texture thing in it instead of crab or cream cheese almost threw up trying
