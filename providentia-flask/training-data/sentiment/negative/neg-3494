Nope. This place was not very good.

It's a really cool space, inside an old house, they've got a nice outdoor bar and cute outdoor seating, plus it's really good for seating a group inside a huge "dining room" area. 

The food was just not that great. I got a salad, and it really really sucked. How does one screw up a salad? I have no idea, but it was terrible. Also, I had a bite of my friends dishes (can't remember what they are) and they were all crappy too. I wished this place was better.
