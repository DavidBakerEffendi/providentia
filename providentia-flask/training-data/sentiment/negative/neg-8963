Food was not fresh, bathrooms filthy, mouldy smell in the restaurant, poor service, very poor food. We ordered seared tuna which is supposed to be raw in the centre, the entire set was light brown as it was old with a very unpleasant texture. Soggy and sometimes sour sashimi bowl, soggy karaage, kimchi pork was ~60% fat with dry meat, sushi rice very unpleasant. Fish across the board was unfresh with very off-putting texture. It was a blow to leave food unfinished and be hit with a $95 bill for two, following with mild stomach aches.

Hate to write negative reviews, but this was negligent across the board, and I hope this will act as an encouragement to the owners to do better and to take food freshness more seriously...all the best.
