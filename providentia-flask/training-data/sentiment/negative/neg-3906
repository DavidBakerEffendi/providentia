They don't serve lots of things that are in the menu. We were disappointed that all the dishes we want were "out". We went there twice and both times they said they were "out" of those food. So then we ordered lettuce wrap but they served us the meat without the lettuce. We had to pay for the full price. The food was not so impressive either. In overall it's a poor quality resturant.
