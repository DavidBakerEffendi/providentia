I had been dying to come here due to hearing great things. This is the absolute worst steak house. EVER. Hands down. Ever. Period. The filet mignon was charred and bland. BLAND! If you're required to douse your steak in a sauce to eat it you are doing it ALL WRONG! The shrimp and lobster were well-cooked but also severely lacked any flavor. This meal was so disappointing, and moreover, cost more than a wonderful meal at Gordon Ramsay Steak!!! This restaurant is a crock. BEWARE!
