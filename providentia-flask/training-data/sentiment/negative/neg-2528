I have no idea how the food tastes. We were here for over ninety five minutes and all that arrived were my finance's dinner and his appetizer. My food never arrived and fully thirty minutes after telling us it was given to another table (that complained because I made a modification), I still wasn't given anything. At that point, I cancelled my order. His meal came without soup and salad, so I did request he get those sent, too. Then it was another fifteen minutes for the bill and still fifteen minutes later, we were waiting for our change. At that point, I requested the money back, put down the exact amount including tip, and we left. The server was running around, and it was clear that the problems were in the kitchen. Our meal should have been comped. We will never be back.
