Had not been in 8 years and decided to give it a try again. Went at 10:45 am to be able to try both breakfast and lunch food. Absolutely no line and I see why. The reviews that say this place has gone down are so accurate,   The food was so plain we didn't leave full at all, left feeling ripped off of $21.  You can get better food for less money so many places.  Go anywhere else, in fact later for dinner we had a fantastic buffet at The Feast Red Rocks for so much less money.
