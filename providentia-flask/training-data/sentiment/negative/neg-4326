Watched the Restaurant Impossible involving the Maple Tree location on Spring Mountain - I haven't been to that location since they changed owners.  In the past i was a fan.  I checked the Food Network website and noticed they were opening in a few more locations within existing Bars.  I then found out they are in my neck of the woods at Lucky's on Jones.

I'm a little hesitant to go there given the revolving door of restaurants at Lucky's - first time i went there, it was a bbq place ( actually liked it the first few times i went there ) then it was a chicago style place ( Chi-town? ) didn't care for that place - i don't think they even lasted 6 months.  Now Maple Tree.

We'll I take my daughter and her boyfriend there last Sunday for post church breakfast.  10 o'clock and there's two people in the bar and no one in the restaurant  - that's NOT GOOD !  Most local bars rely very heavily on the football season and a breakfast place empty on Sunday morning ?!?  Hmmmmm

I order the hash, daughter goes with a chili omelet with the apple fritter and her bf goes with eggs benedict.  We also decide on sharing cinnamon bread french toast.

The service was ok - coffee refilled timely food came out a little slow considering the place was EMPTY.  

The eggs benedict - light on sauce but it was extremely buttery.

The chili omelet - is it hormel or dennison's chili ??

The apple fritter - it was NOTHING  lie how they prepared it on Restaurant Impossible.  Picture a very large sugar-y puffy taco filled with canned apple pie filling  - WTF !

The hash - strange seasoning - very small portion and the rye toast  - raisin's in it ??? strange 

the french toast - cold - it wouldn't surprise me if they took cinnamon bread, put in a toaster then a brush of egg batter  - not good.

Sadly, I'm giving the place 3-4 months.  I really wish it was better because another breakfast place in the SW is needed.
