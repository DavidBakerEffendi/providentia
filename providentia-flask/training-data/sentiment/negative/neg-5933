Many issues here. It took nearly 20 min to just get a drink. Then the 2nd drink took just as long and we informed we had plans in an hour before sitting down. Small things so far... But it gets worse

They charged me for drinks I didn't order. They spilled beer on my dinner. 

When I informed them of the over charge They ran my card twice!!! 

As we got up they spilled catchup all over my wife's back and hair and on my expensive cowboy boots. 

When we told manager he said there is nothing he could do to make us leave happy. 

He gave us a business card and said come visit again when he isn't busy :/ 

It's an hour drive each way for us :(

Don't do it. To many other nearby choices.
