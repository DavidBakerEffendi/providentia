The food was terrible. We had the surprise 3 course meal, and honestly I was really disappointed. Our first course was the most boring, dry, salad. My date didn't even eat it. The food is comparable to crappy wedding/catering food.

Our waiter left us at our table for a long time between our appetizer and dinner, it actually became pretty boring. We ran out of wine, and no one came to check on us for a while. By the time our dessert came we were ready to get out of there.

I guess it was an interesting experience but  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone especially since you pay so much for crappy food/wine/service.
