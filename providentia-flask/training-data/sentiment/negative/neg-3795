We eat here every Friday.  So sad i feel this place is going downhill.  First off when Jen P works service is great.  Was there yesterday , they had no silverware so we had to use plastic ware.  Never enough napkins.  They ran out of salad bowls or they were getting washed.  Brain was our server just seemed like this place was to busy for them to give service.  We had to ask for drinks,  napkins,  dressing for our 50 wings we ordered.  Hope service gets better or we will have to go else where.
