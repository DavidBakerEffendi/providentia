im surprised this place got 3 stars. i drove all the way out to mentor from bainbridge township because of all the hype around this place and its "ethics" about food and i was surely disappointed. i agree with all other reviews, the staff is unfriendly and the burgers are overpriced. but everyone failed to mention how SALTY these burgers are. i mean really i couldnt eat more than one bite it was that bad. there french fries are not salty at all however and need seasoning asap. i asked the employee for dipping sauce and she gives me a pink sauce that she compares to mc donalds 'mac sauce'. its sad to say the sauce did not come even close to comparing to mac sauce. it was cold, chunky, and tasteless. cant believe this is a chain
