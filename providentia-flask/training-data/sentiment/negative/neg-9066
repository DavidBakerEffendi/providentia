Very poor customer service. I am not coming back. Rude, uppity cashiers, no greeting, no room at endcaps to put cart so you can move groceries to ledgecuz too much crap and tables set up for impulse buys which caused me to drop a bottle which broke. NOT ONE PERSON ASKED IF I WAS OK or needed help, just scoffed and rolled eyes as I pucked glass out of my foot. No attempt to clean it for at least ten minutes. Just rudeness. From now on I'm buying my overpriced groceries and cheese at Whole Foods. Screw you guys. Then when I left you asked my white friend if she was ok. Have fun being a cashier. #6figuresandsinglenokids #disposableincome #shoppingwhilebrown
