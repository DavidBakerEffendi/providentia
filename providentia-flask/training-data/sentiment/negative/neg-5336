Had lunch here today. Wanted to order Arancini. Apparently, I was looking at the happy hour menu but that's what I was given. 

Ordered 2 Bloody Mary's and asked if they really make them like the picture your Facebook page posted a few weeks back (showed him the pic) his response, "yea I guess we can do that. It's a brunch thing normally."  It was currently 1:45pm. Brunch is served until 3pm on Sunday. Drink was the worst Bloody Mary I have ever had. I couldn't even finish it. 

Asked for a house salad but with romaine lettuce instead of mixed greens. Waiter asked if I wanted house dressing and I asked what it was. His answer, " I don't really know what it is."  I said a side of ranch is fine. Salad comes and it's mixed greens. Forgot the ranch dressing. 

I will say the chicken sandwich was delicious. 

This is the 3rd time I have been here and won't be going back.
