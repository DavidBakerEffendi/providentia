Preface: I only eat sushi nigiri and sashimi and consider myself a sushi enthusiast (it is my favorite food). 

This was my third time eating at this restaurant. The first two times were great, and all of a sudden everything went to hell in a hand basket. 

Let me summarize:
1) I had to ask 3 times to get a miso soup (not a big deal on its own)
2) food took over 45 minutes to come out from the point of us placing the order (apparently because the unagi needed to be cooked...hey, next time bring everything else out first and then the unagi later like every other sushi place does. Maybe that way our sushi won't be room temperature and taste off.)
3) the maguro (tuna) sushi tasted old and overly fishy to the point where my coworker, who loves tuna, had to spit it out into his napkin. I unfortunately swallowed my piece of tuna and now I'm feeling ill writing this review.
4) our waiter did not remove the tuna from our bill even though it cost $7 and our entire bill was $218. He claimed he spoke with his Mgmt and they refused to remove it from the bill. I'm pretty sure that is a lie as almost any manager knows you SHOULD remove something off the bill if someone has to literally spit out into their napkin because it tastes disgusting.

What makes me ultimately write this review is that Maiko did not care about whether we enjoyed our meals and would ever come back. It was the 3rd time I had eaten there in a month, and I was a huge fan. But instead here I am feeling nauseous in bed from that ****ing tuna, writing my first ever negative review. 

Eat there with caution--it will either be great or you will literally leave angry and feeling ill.
