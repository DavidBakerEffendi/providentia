I met friends for dinner at this restaurant. It took the server more than a half hour to take our orders. My meal was so extremely salty I couldn't eat it. The server was kind enough to offer to have it remade but I figured it would be the same so I asked for a side salad instead. She didn't charge me, which I didn't expect. We stayed and talked for a while and when our waters were refilled they had soggy bits of paper at the bottom. We asked for fresh glasses and those also came back with paper floating in them. She decided it was the ice that might have pieces of paper from straw wrappers or napkins that had fallen into the ice storage. Eeew! I feel that quality control is definitely missing at this location.
