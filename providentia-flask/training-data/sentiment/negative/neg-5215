Was super excited about trying the new Naked Chicken Taco. I went through the drive thru, I couldn't understand the cashier because he was talking extremely fast as while mumbling. When I got to the window ise greeting was, "Wassup Brah". Excuse me, I don't know you as well as it's extremely unprofessional. My Naked Chicken Taco was disgusting, cold, hard, and tasted as if it had been fried in week old grease. My Doritos Locos Cheese Taco was cold and soggy. I'm not even going to stomach the 3rd taco. To top it all off there was a wait in the drive thru. If I'm going to wait, my food should be fresh.
