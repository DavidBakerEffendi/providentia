I cannot believe how things have changed in 3 years. I picked up duck congee sometime in the winter when my hubby was sick.  I was very disappointed because the ginger fish sauce tasted like it had gone bad (it should never be bitter).  Today, my hubby wanted to eat there since he was craving the duck congee and most places don't serve the duck & coleslaw side. We waited about 10 minutes to get our menu.  After we placed our orders, we waited another 5 minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu.  I could go on with the details but the gist of the story is they were understaffed or the staff was slow.  The worst part of it was that the service.  The servers make us feel bad for asking for anything (like when they took our order).  We had arrived and placed our order before another couple bside us at least 10 minutes ahead but somehow, this couple received their pho before mine.  They were almost done eating their pho before mine came out.
