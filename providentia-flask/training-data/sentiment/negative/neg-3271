Loved it when they first opened. Stopped coming because it was inconsistent and disappointing. Tried again tonight after several months and won't be back. I ordered the pepper philly combo and there were more peppers than meat. It was too dry to swallow. Cheese was only on a small part of the sandwich. I have never left a yelp review, sorry this has to be my first.
