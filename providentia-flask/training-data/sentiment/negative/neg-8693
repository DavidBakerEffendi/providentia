Do not stop here!! If Yelp had a -5 I would rate it there. This is by far the worst service I've ever had at a fast food restaurant. I walked into the store for takeaway at 7:07pm on the 28th of October. Two people were in front of me and it then took 17 minutes to get served. The server repeatedly had issues taking my order. It then took another 26 mins to get my meal. We then left at 7:50pm. 43 Minutes to get a meal is horrible. I could have been to a sit down restaurant in this time. They thought they would be nice and give me a few extra items but it ended up making up for the missing side, missing sauce and cold chicken and wedges. As per my photos the place was dirty. If the owner reads this feel free to pull up the cameras to watch me wait for 43 minutes.  What was even worse 2 couples came in nearly 10 minutes after me and were given their meals 5-10+ minutes before me.  I will never be back!
