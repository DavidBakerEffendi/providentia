Calgary has amazing upscale eateries and Rush has been hyped to be part of that elite group.  Swank decor aside; I can't say I can agree given the mediocre overall experience at the restaurant.

The first impression from th entrance is stunning, the interior decor is ultra-modern and sophisticated.  The service is prompt on the slow side  although lacks attentiveness when asking something out of the menu description or receiving the food cooking temperature as ordered or suggested .  

Eight people were in our group, two having specific dietary requirements.  This is supposed to be a seafood and steak house, the steaks came back way undercooked for medium and medium well, while the seafood and particularly the seared salmon were way overcooked for medium.  One of our guests ordered a seared salmon with a salad instead of the starch accompanying it; a rubbery well done fish came to the table with a tiny round cup of sliced butter lettuce and 8 tiny little square green pepper squares (less than penny sized each); the portions left very little to be desired.

All and all, the decor is impressive but the lack of service attentiveness and the food being well below average for the category of establishment "Rush" is Branded to be, leads us to keep moving to other downtown Calgary dining explorations; next!
