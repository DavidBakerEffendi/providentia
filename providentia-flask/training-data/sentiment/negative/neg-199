I have being to the original Humble Pie location downtown and i was eager for a quick pie to go at the airport.  I am use to airport pricing, so I was okay with price point, the pie turned out pretty good, the crust was slightly too burnt, but the pepperoni had a nice spice to it.

My biggest compliant was my wait, I ordered my pie, than went to the restroom came back and saw the customer in front of me just get her pie, I waited patiently and saw that there were several pies in the oven going.  Than 6+ pies came out, all these were from customers who ordered after me, a set of 6+ pies went in and as they were coming out I didn't see mine's, I asked the guy baking and he didn't see my name on the tickets for the pies.  So about 12+ pizzas came out before mine's did, no this isn't an airport where people are in a hurry to catch their flights or anything important like that.
