My GF and I were going to Firefly and like usual they were packed and we didnt want to wait 45 mins for a table so we decided to try Yolies. BAD idea!!!! The whole experience was a nightmare. For a hundred bucks all we both took away from here was a bad after taste and stomach ache. Avoid this dump at all costs.
