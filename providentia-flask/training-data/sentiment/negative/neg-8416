Food is OK, but service is TERRIBLE. I keep giving this place another chance in hopes that it gets better, but it never does. First experience the lady that helped me was extremely rude and flustered. The past two times in the drive thru I have been on the run and they have forgotten items from my order, and I had to go back. They never compensate for anything. TERRIBLE SERVICE! I recommend just going to Paradise Bakery.
