This place needs help. The food is just plain bad. Just a bunch of cheap ingredients buried over with sour cream. Go to El Barrio if you get in or for something less formal go to Carolinas or Tee Pee. I went to Los Olivos a long time ago and didn't like it and it seems that it has gotten worse. One star is exaggerating its quality. Looks like I'm never coming back.
