Very rude and poor customer service.  A great example of poor management and ownership here where everyone (6 people working) and they ignore you the customer.  I literally stood by myself for more than 5 minutes waiting to be acknowledged and wanting to place a single item order.  Behind the counter the "team" walked by numerous times without even a hello.  Also one of the dirtier Einsteins!
