My girlfriends and I had a terrible experience at this establishment. We all work in the service industry so we were being very patient and more than forgiving. We waited 30 minutes just to be greeted (thank god we weren't on a time crunch), which meant we had to go and find our server and tell him that we wanted drinks, an apppetizer, and waters. The drinks took another 15 minutes to arrive, the waters another 10 after that, and then we finally got to order. The food was great! After our meals, we were told that the printer was out of paper and that we couldn't be provided with an itemized check. My girlfriend paid with her debit card which was presented on paper, when asking though,  we were told the checks were printed on different paper. Right. Then out of curiosity, we added up our total (tax included) and found out that we were charged $17 over what we should have. I've been here other times with my girlfriends and have never had this poor of an experience. To not be presented with an itemized check was questionable. We won't be back.
