I just had to chime in with Dave to balance out the ratings on this place. It was some of the boringest (is that a word), blandest pizza ever. I've had better frozen pizzas.

Not only that, the one time I ate there, the dining room was cold as the Grinch's heart, and there was a REALLY-LOUD-TALKING lady there, whose voice boomed throughout the entire establishment.
