We stepped into the Toby Keith Bar this evening at 12:30a, the website did show that it's business hours lasted until 2a; and received by far the WORST customer experience to date. 
We purchased cocktails and within 10 minutes they turned off the music and turned the lights on to begin closing. 
We asked if they were closing early, explained we thought they were staying open until 2a, and the bartender stated, and I quote "That's what you get for looking at the website! Ya, we're closing. Business is slow so we're done." 
All of this was communicated in the most condescending voice/communication that we did not expect from this establishment.
We mentioned our frustration with their communication - none of this aggression and condescending tones were necessary. 
This was followed up with a bartender/bar back yelling across the bar 'If you have a problem with me, get back here and take it up with me'. 
The aggression and complete lack of customer service was over the top and completely unnecessary. 
We would have happily come back the next night, this being our first visit, until your staff aggressively taunted our party and rudely pushed all of their customers out of the door. 
This experience has left a sour taste in our mouth and a disappointing/disrespectful view of this establishments brand. Very disappointed, and all from the managing staff representing your business.
I do hope the Sr Mgt reaches out to rectify this issue. Until then, I highly suggest avoiding this venue unless these actions are what you seek when visiting the Toby Keith Bar and grill.
