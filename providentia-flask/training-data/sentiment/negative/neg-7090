They have poor customer service! We orders $60 worth of food it came all messed up.  I even called and let them know and have a print out of my delivery. ( they were more concerned about the way I received my print out...???? Email confirmation and refused to refund me,  only store credit.  They wanted food back.  They didn't even want to redeliver!!
