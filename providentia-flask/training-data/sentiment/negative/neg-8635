The place is called DESERT PEAKS now. I and 3 coworkers went yesterday for lunch. Our company relocated our office off of McKellips. We have been trying to look for a good lunch place. DESERT PEAKS has now been crossed off our list. We must have gotten the hemorrhoid waitress also. She was not attentive to our needs at all. She was more concerned on flirting for tips with her bar patrons. It took 30 min for us to receive our food. (there was only one other table for 2 seated) When she brought our food out to us she placed it in front of us and immediately turned and walked off. She did not ask if everything looked ok or if she could bring us anything else. I actually  did need sauce and cheese for my italian sausage sandwich and my friend needed ranch for her fries. I sat without touching my meal hoping she would come and check on us. The waitress never came back. After 15 minutes my friend finally got her attention to come to the table. I asked for my sauce & cheese and ranch. She took my plate. Then came back said she forgot what the other request was. We told her ranch. She brought back the ranch and my plate. My fries were now cold. One of my friends had pizza. His dough was not baked in the middle. It was very soggy and alot of grease was formed on the top from the pepperoni. It was a HORRIBLE experience. She was a crappy waitress and the food was less than average. This is coming from someone that eats lunch out 5 times a week.
