I used to come here for their shawarma, but not anymore after having a negative experience. Eaten over ten times prior. The last time I was there, it was getting pretty busy during dinner hrs and I was patiently waiting in line to order. Once I placed my order for a shawarma I had to wait more than 20 mins to be called to create my order. Long story short, they purposely served other customers who ordered after me with higher order numbers. Lame...
