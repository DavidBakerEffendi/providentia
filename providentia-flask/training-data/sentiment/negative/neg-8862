Probably one of the worst delicatessen I have ever been to. Service was fine, but the food was another story. Was there Thursday night at 7:40 and ordered two corn beef sandwiches to go. They were almost inedible. They were so dry and corned beef had no flavor. I was embarrassed to tell my husband how much I paid. Have been to much better delicatessens.
