I had never been here before for a carwash...probably won't go back. Most probably go for the food. Car wash didn't even get off the bugs off the front of the car even after the employee took a brush to it. Confusing for first time users, not clear where to pull up and pay. Employee had to run my $ into the store. But I guess they like it that way so you are forced to eat or shop!
