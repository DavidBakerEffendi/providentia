Went to this restaurant a couple weeks ago due to the Groupon which we thought was a great deal. From the minute we were seated and they were made aware that we have a Groupon deal, the waiter snatched the regular menu away and said we couldn't order from this. No big deal, we know Groupons are sometimes limited. But then to ignore us throughout the night to where I have to stop 4 different people to refill my glass of water. Maybe it was the service we were receiving but we did not enjoy the food either. Tasted frozen and had that "not so fresh" fishy taste. Anyways, sad to say, we will not be coming back to this place. Money is better spent elsewhere...
