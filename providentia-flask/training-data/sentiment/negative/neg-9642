This place is horrible. Don't waste your money. Worst quality seafood I've ever seen at any buffet. Lobster tails were dry and over cooked, didn't even try the oysters bc they looked and smelled awful, sushi wasn't consistent, some good some bad. It was just bad and let just say that I ended up paying for it later.
