Apparently they are so successful at the Cork & Cleaver that they do not need business. My wife and I walked in today and sat at the bar for 5 minutes while the bartender talked to a local news celebrity. Apparently he was so enamored with her that he could not bother to tear himself away to wait on us. After waiting for close to five minutes, we just got up and walked away and he didn't even try to stop us. Must be good times over the Cork & Cleaver where money is not needed from customers other than local celebrities.
