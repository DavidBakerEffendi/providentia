These employees at this location are incompetent. They can't even take simple orders or provide decent customer service. Ordered and charged for turkey bacon avocado sandwich and there was NO avocado when I got the sandwich... & extra charge for the avocado that was non-existent. Recommend not ordering to go and to be sure that you watch them make your sandwich to make sure it's done correctly or they'll rip you off.
