The workers here were extremely rude and service is extremely slow. 

When I first placed my order there was only one couple ahead of me. After waiting 30 mins, I went up to ask how much longer it was going to take for the food to be ready and the worker basically yelled at me that there was no more chicken and that I had to wait. I saw this happen to another customer that asked the same question. Eventually the worker yelled that "I can't rush the chicken, do you want this shit raw". 

Would not recommend.
