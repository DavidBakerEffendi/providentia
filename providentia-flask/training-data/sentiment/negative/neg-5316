The chow mein noodles were not even cooked and their steamed dumplings were pretty hard to chew on and the restaurant was absolutely empty. First time i had to spit it back out. I had the sichuan beef and asked for very spicy but wasnt spicy at all. I highly do not recommend this place. Ps
You dont even want to go in the restrooms.
