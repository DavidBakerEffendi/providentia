Very disappointed how the quality just went downhill. This used to be my go to seafood buffet but now need to look else where. 
We went around 5pm on a Sunday. Food wasn't fresh. You could just see a layer of dryness on the food like it was sitting for a while. I assume they were waiting until the dinner rush to replenish the food? The sashimi was not even cut a decent size. I mean it's like they took one Normal slice then sliced that into four teeny pieces. The crab legs didn't even get filled until just before we left. Typically they're filled every ten mins or so. That's another thing that changed. The quality of the crab legs are now the bright red water filled crab legs you can find at a typical Chinese buffet. 
Ugh. I'm sad to see how bad the quality was. Then there was the service. 
I mean. Every single time I've been, service is great! Drinks filled before they were empty. Plates were gone by the time I came back for more food. But not tonight. We never even saw our server. Plates gathered at our table. The only reason we got refills was because I flagged down the hostess that sat us and asked her for a refill. Then suddenly we had someone clean up the plates. 
Like I said. When this place first opened it was great! Food was always fresh! Service was great! Now, quality and everything has gone down. Time to look for another place.
