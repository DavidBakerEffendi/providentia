Where do I start?  College football on several TVS with lots of open seating yet we were seated in a corner by a cash register. We ordered coffee and when they brought it to us we were told they had no cream. I asked for a small shot of baileys in lieu of cream and was ultimately charged $10.50 for the shot. We had to ask for silverware, water and butter for the toast. Bloody Mary's were $13.50 each, we both ordered sausage but one of us got bacon. We had to flag down our waitress for hot sauce, salt and pepper. Overall the meal was very bland, both of us had 2 eggs. Hash browns, toast and 1 Bloody Mary each and the bill was over $80. Avoid this place. Try Americas at NY NY.
