Be careful with you check,today I did a big mistake. We came in early morning to this location,made orders,ate our food,and after our nice waitress gave us check,it was 15$. After 20 min we were going to pay,when probably manager,some employee from this restaurant came to me and yelled at me that I have to pay,because waitress had to go home,and he just took my card and after 5 min brought me back,without recipe where I should sigh. I left 3$ tip in cash,and we left, and later I discovered,they charged me 20$ instead of 15$,and I haven't even put my signature on the check.
