Bad service, not clean, misleading and misunderstandings due to language barriers. A lot of conditions on paying. Food was too spicy, the rice pudding and butter chicken with rice were the two ok things. Buffet is $10 a person. Brought a friend had a voucher which does not state cannot be used at lunch so very confusing as other vouchers do. Not a modern atmosphere I prefer but they tried their best with keeping clean at least the food presentation area. I will give someone else the voucher with details, my friend and I do not intend to revisit.
