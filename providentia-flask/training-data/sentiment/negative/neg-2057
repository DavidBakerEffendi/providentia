Based on other Yelp reviews, this place looked promising. My experience however was far from a 5 star review. 

I can't say that the chicken sandwich tasted horrible, because it didnt. It had a pretty decent sauce but the chicken was low quality and under cooked. After eating about half, I felt sick to my stomach. This feeling lasted the rest of the entire day.

The fries were okay but absolutely nothing special. 

Very nice staff though and that's the only positive thing about my time there. It was also a fairly clean, nicely decorated establishment.

I guess the sandwiches just photograph well because the looks were most definitely deceiving.
