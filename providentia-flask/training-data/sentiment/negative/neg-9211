Horrible. This place used to be decent; must have changed hands. Shrimp egg roll had one minuscule shrimp, lots of grease and tasted of rancid oil. Sesame noodles were a pile of noodles (of questionable origin) with what had to be creamy peanut butter squirted on top. Fried pot stickers looked and tasted like they had been cooked days ago and warmed up in an oven: dry and tasteless. The "house" fried rice was super-dry, again had the rancid oil taste, and had none of the promised ingredients of pork, beef or chicken...but did have (again) that one annoying, minuscule shrimp. This is not just bad food, it is a rip-off. Do not let these folks continue this scam: do not patronize them.
