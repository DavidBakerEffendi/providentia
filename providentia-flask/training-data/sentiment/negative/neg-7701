We booked the Venetian hotel this time and supposed it would be a wonderful stay in Las Vegas. However I was totally wrong. First, I was charged twice at the hotel cafe express; secondly the hotel front desk intended to charge me $180 more on top of the 2 nights' accommodation fee and claimed I had all craps from hotel room mini bar. Give me a break and don't play mathematic games with me especially I am a CPA. So after one minutes questing/complaining;  the lady corrected the bill so quickly. Okay come to the worst part of our stay; we found my husband's car was smashed at the hotel parking spot P1b; someone smashed into the front passenger window and stole my apple nano, cable etc. We saw blood on the car seats and scratches everywhere. Apparently, they tried to steal the auto radio or something else. Luckily it didn't happen. Thank God.  I gave one star coz the hotel security and housekeeping service were very responsible and helpful. I think we will not come back again!
