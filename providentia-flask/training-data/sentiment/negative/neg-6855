We went with a friend of ours who's parents owned a chinese restaurant and was huge fan or all types of asian cuisine. Well he no longer trusts my suggestions.

Our first and only time here was beyond disappointing. Our friend ordered dumplings and he knew something wasn't right by how fast they came out-microwave. The orange goop on my sushi was less than appetizing as was the rest of the food. 

$63 for horrible horrible food and lame service was an experience I could have passed.
