This usual to be a nice place with friendly staff and good food. But the last few times we've been here the experience were very poor. They keep on seating people without regard of the servers being slammed. We sat for over 20 mins at the table without anyone come by to even said " hi, I'll be right with you". The busperson gave us coffee and disappear. We had to flag down someone to track down a server.  But people who know the owner got served before people been waiting for long time. The food may be good but I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here unless you're a friend of the owner. This place no longer offer a good eating experience.
