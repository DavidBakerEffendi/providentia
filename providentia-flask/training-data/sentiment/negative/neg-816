This place has the worst customer service I have ever seen. You walk in there are three adolescent hostess at the door. They are snotty and rude and dressed in clothing that would scarcely be appropriate in the home environment. You then wait agonizingly long on what is supposed to be contemporary furnishing. For the amount of time you sit there though it is uncomfortable while you watch the what appear to be incredibly stupid hostess adjust the waistband of her tights for 20 minutes but never seat one freaken person. Finally I get up to survey what the deal is and note no less than five open tables clean and ready to seat. When an inquiry is made we are amazingly next to be seated. They bring us to a table the seats are dirty the floor around it is covered with trash. You have to move the cheap ass furniture to even sit down. We had to share our menus with the table next to us who ended up seating themselves because they were like what the heck. There were not enough clean glasses for them to have one each they shared a water glass. This place is at best a bad joke. Bad experience overall.
