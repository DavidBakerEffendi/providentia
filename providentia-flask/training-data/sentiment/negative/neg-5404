Do not go here!!!!
I was waiting for a ride in Port Credit and I thought I'd grab a quick bite to eat at Gino's Pizza. This experience was a total nightmare, it just kept getting worse and worse.
I saw a sign for 2 slices for $5 and went inside. It looked kind of scuzzy but they served pizza and beer, two staples in my diet.
I ordered a slice of Pepperoni and a slice with pepperoni, mushrooms, and green peppers. I took a bite of the pepperoni and it tasted like cardboard. Completely tasteless, so I decided to eat the other one. It was bland but that's not the worst part. When I looked at the slice of pepperoni, there was a FLY IN IT. I was disgusted. I spent forever trying to get the attention of the staff (they were in the back talking, I was SCREAMING "excuse me", but they didn't seem to hear me). When he finally came over I let him know and he apologized and gave me another slice. Umm okay. That's disgusting. I sat back down and looked at the wall and there were dead flies all around the sign inside. Oh God. I didn't eat my second slice.
I went to the bathroom which was decrepit at best. It was horrifyingly dirty, like everything else in this place. I refused to use it. I just left. To top it all off, when I went outside and around the corner (where my ride was waiting to get me) the neon sign was CAKED IN FLIES. Bleh! So unhygienic. This place cannot be up to code. It was absolutely horrendous. I spent rest of the night nursing my aching stomach.
Will never return.
