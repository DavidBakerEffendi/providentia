I should really read those reviews before come. 
The food was not nice at all- I ordered a MaoXueWang and it was 80% full of spring sproutÔºÅ
The price was high!- Is it they don't know how much other similar restaurants' similar food?!
The service was fucking rude!!!!--we were not that hungry so we only ordered one dish and he said" only one?! Whatever. It's up to you." And then left. When we checked, they asked us to pay cash but we wanted to use card. But since they asked, we putted all of our cash on the table. They counted and it was only enough for paying food, no more for tips. Before we said nothing,they said"you have to pay tips!" We said:"so use the card." and then they received our card reluctantly. 

We are visitor in Vegas and this restaurant had ruined our beautiful night totally. We highly don't recommend you guys go there. This kind of restaurant doesn't deserve to get people's business. 

If you don't know how to do your business, you will shut down one day, sooner or later.
