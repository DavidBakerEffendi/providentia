Terrible food, terrible service. We ordered the bjs favorite deep dish. Pizza was cut poorly in uneven slices. Toppings were clustered in separate sections, one slice was bare of all toppings, even cheese, peppers and onions were raw. We then ordered a pazookie for desert, 45 mins later we finally got it and was raw. Server didn't check in with us at all while we were waiting and wasn't even on the floor for us to track her down. She said someone else took ours, had she checked in she would have caught that earlier. Management did remove from bill but did not visit table, did not see any management presence on floor.
