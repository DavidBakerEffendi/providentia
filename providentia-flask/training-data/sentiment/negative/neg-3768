Their bagels are good as well as their coffee.  My only gripe is that I've been here twice and both times they burned the bagel toasting it and gave it to me burnt. Who the heck eats burnt bagels? What employee would think someone would eat it burnt and still serve it. Both times I got it to go so I had to come back both times to get it fixed. Needless to say I will never return to this Einsteins.
