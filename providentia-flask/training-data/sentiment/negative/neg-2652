I love Fuddruckers but this location is terrible! We ordered through UberEATS! I have gone to the location in Tempe many a times so I know how ordering works! When you order from Fudds normally you choose your burger with the works of what ever you like and then it ALWAYS comes with fries unless you prefer something else! So we order with our hearts content, waiting, waiting, and waiting! Finally the food arrives, and like a slap in the face NO FRIES!!!! I even asked for extra cheese sauce for fries, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSE TO DO WITH ALL THIS CHEESE NOW WITH NO FRIES!  So I call the location and the lady talks to me as if I don't know how ordering from fudds works! She said we would have to call UberEATS and have a new order just for fries WTH! Lady fries are suppose to come with our meals! Disappointed with the food, upset with the lack of service, and angry at the fact that she underestimated my knowledge of Fudds ordering service! LMAO! Have a better luck ordering from them guys, just beware!
