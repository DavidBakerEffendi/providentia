I just had a terrible experience at La Piccola Cucina!

I've been to this restaurant several times in the past and enjoyed the home-style cooking.  Needless to say, I was very excited when a voice daily deal came out that allowed me to purchase a $30 food voucher for $15!

This place is on my way home from work, so I saved the coupon for a night that I was working late - excited to grab some delicious takeout on the way home.

One of the servers was in the middle of taking my order when the owner of the restaurant saw that I had the coupon.  He snatched it angrily out of my hand shouting "this is only good for 2 people dining in - not take out!"  I informed him that this restriction was not stated anywhere on the coupon that I had purchased and he shouted back, "I don't care!  That's the way it's always been!"  In a restaurant full of other diners, the shouting continued until I was embarrassed enough to leave...

I just can't believe how completely rude and belligerent he was to me - In my opinion, this is no way to ever treat your valued customers.

I will be demanding a refund on my coupon and won't be returning to this restaurant again.
