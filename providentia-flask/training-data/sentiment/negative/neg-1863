Super poor experience. There during busy lunch rush. Ordered Pa Nang chicken lunch. After 25 minutes they delivered curry flavored water with a little shrimp and no coconut milk. It was disgusting. I flagged the server, handed it back, and then they ignored me for next 20 minutes. I paid for ice tea and left, never to return.
