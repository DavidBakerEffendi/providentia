This was mom's favorite place until today. We came as a family of 6 and since they expanded, they now add an automatic 18% gratuity. We ordered several dishes to-go and those were also included in the 18% gratuity. We asked the owner to take it out but to no avail. This is not an 18% gratuity place. Never going again.
