Do not go here! I'm surprised there isn't police tape around this shack condemning it. This has to be one of the filthiest restaurants I've ever set foot in. It's an old house, and it looks like the people who own it haven't made any modifications since the turn of the century...the 19th century.

It's supposed to be Italian food, but it's more a mix of cookie-cutter 1980's pasta dishes and wtf-ever happened to be cheap at the market that day. I only looked at the food here, so I can't tell you how it actually tastes, but if that's any indication there's a reason why I just looked.

Consider yourself warned.
