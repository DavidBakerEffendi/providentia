We ordered from here by mistake thinking it was our favorite place (Mika's).  When we got the food it looked very different.  

* The tzaziki sauce was sweet and we like it sour (preference)
* the salad dressings were the typical Italian (?????) champaign, things that don't seem to fit the menu.
* the meat was so dry we could not even chew most of it.
* the rice has about 2% of it mixed with basmati and most was simple plain white basmati.

10 minutes after eating my son started feeling really sick and started throwing up. My husband and I quit after a few bites and we found it to be over cooked, not seasoned and seemed old.

I don't recommend this place.
