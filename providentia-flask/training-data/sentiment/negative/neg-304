There are much better Brazilian restaurants.  The poor service overshadowed the food.  The waiter and bus boy gave us the hard sell on the all you can eat, we succumbed, and then we waited 10 minutes before we saw any meat!  I called the waiter over and discussed our displeasure with the delay, especially after seeing the waiter walk by with meat and requesting meat directly from him.  The waiter had the nerve to argue with me before finally bringing out some meat.  I am fine with paying $35 for all you can eat, but if I'm paying $35, I expect the meat to come around at a reasonable interval.  I'm never going back.
