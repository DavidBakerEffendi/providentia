I decided to try them again.
One guy kept pulling his pants up; only problem with that is"he still had his gloves on and trying to prepare my food". And this was the same week that all Chipotle stores closed on a Monday for food safety. Feb. 8th 2016...my visit Feb. 11th
Another guy was by the grill and checking his messages.
Burrito tasted okay.
