Wow, they lost a lot of business from a local because of an extremely rude waitress and a no one under 21 policy sign in their door. Is that even legal? I believe that would count as age discrimination because the legal drinking age in Ontario is 19...
   Anyway I went in here one afternoon with someone who was over 30 and the waitress told us to leave after our beer was ordered because his ID was two days expired. The silly part is that he obviously  was not under 18 (he has gray hairs and looks over 30). She made kind of a scene and really embarassed us. 
   Now I just frequent Fion Mc Cools next door and the Jester. It's too bad I had such a negative experience here because I'm an avid pub-goer and they probably lost hundreds in business from someone in the neighborhood. Tsk tsk...
