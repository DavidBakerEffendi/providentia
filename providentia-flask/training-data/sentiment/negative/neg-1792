Absolutely disgusting.  Sorry, but I'm being honest.  I love sushi.  Rolls...sashimi...etc etc and here, it was as if I got sushi out of a vending machine.  It's hard to mess up a spicy tuna roll.  I took one bite and pretty much had to spit it out.  

Maybe the "food" is good there, but I will NEVER go there for sushi.  

The staff is friendly and the place is clean.  However, I wish the place that used to be in this location was still there. 

Again, sushi out of a vending machine.  Ick.
