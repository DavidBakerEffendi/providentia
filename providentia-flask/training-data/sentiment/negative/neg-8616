OK food but not worth another try.  My daughter and I tried to like this place as we are from Long Island and it is convenient to our home. Daughter Heidi ordered a bagel and it came with a small portion of cream cheese so I ordered another side of the cream cheese.  They charged a ridiculous amount for the side and when we talked to the manager he was arrogant, aloof and obnoxious telling us that was it he was not going to do anything in our favor.  The cost of the side was actually more than the bagel.  There are plenty of choices in Scottsdale and I don't recommend this one.
