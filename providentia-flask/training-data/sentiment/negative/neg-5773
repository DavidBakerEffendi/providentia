I should preface this with I am a disgruntled customer. Having usually ordered delivery from Dormont to Mt. Washington, I placed my order, gave my credit card, and waited 20 minutes before getting a call to tell me that they don't deliver to Mt. Washington. I would have loved to try their food, but unfortunately didn't get the opportunity to.
