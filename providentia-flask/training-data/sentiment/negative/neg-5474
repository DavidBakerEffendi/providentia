DO NOT EAT HERE
I wish I could give negative stars

My boyfriend and I both got food poisoning, we ate there 11/28/11. 
The only thing our meals had in common was the beans. 
I also reported it with the southern las vegas health board.

Ew.


& I'm not even going to waste my time talking about the service. The girl working the register was super rude.
