Horrible. The food itself is so so at best, basically cheaply made and overpriced. If you order delivery good luck on them getting your order right or .....even completing the order. Call in for a manager and they're always "too busy" and couldn't care less once you pay. Take your money to another pizzaria, there's plenty of better places out there.
