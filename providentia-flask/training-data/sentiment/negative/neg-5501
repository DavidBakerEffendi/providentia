First time here since they opened. Walked in cause the drive up was slammed. Big guy making sandwiches talking too much to coworker then pulls out his cell phone and answered a call. Person in front of me. A guy behind me. Went to the restroom and person in front still not waited on. Big guy says " sorry there's going to be a wait". As he is moving like a frigging snail. Two guys there were not friendly and did not seem
Happy to have a job. I predict they won't last. People don't have time to wait. I'll go to Starbucks next door!!
