The only reason it got one star is because I couldn't  give it zero stars, food was like eating salt out of the salt dispenser. Servers were ok. When I complained about the food there was no effort made by management to even talk to me. My family ate at Casa Flores many years ago and really enjoyed the food. Don't know what's happened to this place but I'll never be back. It's pretty sad when you can get better chips and salsa at 7-Eleven.
