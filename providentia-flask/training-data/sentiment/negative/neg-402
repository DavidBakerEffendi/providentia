I was actually here a little over a month ago for lunch. Since I can't give it zero stars, the one star is just for the decor.

Tables were not clean, and plates not set. We sat down for at least 10 minutes without tea, and then when we asked for our plate settings, the waitress gave me dirty chopsticks.

There was even a Caucasian family that came in, sat in a table near us and looked at the menu and said no thanks. I saw them at Mr Congee when I left the mall. 

However, food was so-so. Just ordered two plates of dumplings and I wasn't too impressed with them.

I wouldn't recommend or come back here at all.
