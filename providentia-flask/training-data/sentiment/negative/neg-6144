I would post a video of the manager and the lady at the second window screaming at each other but i was atonished to see such scene ,anyway, worse service ever. The guy that took the order was fine but when i got to the window to pay the manager seems to mistreat the workers there she has no manners and she screams at them like they were stupid. If i remember well her name is Luisa. Someone should do something about that. They also charged us the wrong amount and didnt say anything and when i asked for my receipt the manager gave me the look and they also messed up my order etc... Worse worse service ever.
