I've been to this Salty Senorita three times to eat, and a few more with just the sole intention of getting drunk. After my most recent experience here, I can guarantee that I will not be eating here ever again, and it's highly unlikely that I'd be back to drink, either. Went in this past Sunday at about 3 in the afternoon with some friends, there were a total of maybe 20 people in the place, most of them posted up at the bar. Not busy whatsoever, which means there's no valid explanation as to why the service was so utterly slow. The salsa was bland (tried both the regular and the "hot"...which wasn't in any way), the food was overpriced for what you get, and what I got was the wrong order so I had to send it back (which I absolutely hate doing...I've seen "Waiting" a few times). Our waitress was as bland as the salsa, and the whole staff just seemed bored and annoyed that they were there. One of my friends who was starving didn't even finish half of his food, it was so awful, and when I finally got my order back the second time it was still not what I had asked for. At this point we just wanted to leave, so I gagged it down and we payed our bill, happy that this experience was finally over.
