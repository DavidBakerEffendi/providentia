Place has hit bottom in less than a year.  Visited there last night.  Salad bar depleted and what was there was old.  Nobody attending pasta bar.  Server did not have a clue about how food was prepared and could not answer basic questions about menu.  One of our companions sent food back because it was not ordered and no follow up.  Just terrible experience.
