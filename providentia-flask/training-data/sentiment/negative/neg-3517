They didn't tell me until AFTER I started my order they didn't have basic ingredients. then when I complain you take 10% or $.80 off my order. I just watched you give the lady in front of me 50% off and a free drink plus free pizza ticket. You gave ppl waiting free drinks. Then my food was just OK! Besides paying basically full price for a THAI chicken pizza with crumbs of chicken (bc y'all ran out of that too) the sauce was thin more so like a dressing and saltier than a salt lick. 
HORRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE. How are you mad at me bc YOU ran out of stuff?
