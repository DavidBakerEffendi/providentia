Changes to the buffet have alienated many regulars as the 3 previous lines, 1 for VIP, 1 for handicaps and others have been merged to 2.  Handicap go ahead of VIPs and last Saturday, able bodied were placed ahead as the cashier decided to let people go ahead in the handicap line due to being Filipino.  I guess a new disability.  There is less table and machine business as many have backed off and slots seem tighter than ever. complaints seem to go nowhere now.  They need to understand that the handicap laws ensure equal access, not priority. This in a state that abuses these laws and a facility that refuses to enforce these laws.
