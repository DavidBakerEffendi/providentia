Tried going again for take out even though I was so disappointed in the service the last time.  Sure enough... I get home, and every single item is wrong.  EVERY ONE!  These guys are terrible.  Out of principle alone, please pick another spot.  Their service is horrible and their manager was extremely rude about the whole situation.  This place is being ran by amateurs.
