I ended up at MiraKuru on a whim one night as I was walking by looking for a place to eat on 17th avenue. We took a little time to think over our food orders and ordered drinks in the meantime. The drinks were overly sweet & not particularly memorable. We then ordered a few appetizers in place of an entree as we wanted to sample a few things. Then, we waited. Our server didn't come over to ask if we wanted more drinks or to explain any kind of delay on our food. The restaurant had a larger party and a few other tables but nothing a professional restaurant of that size shouldn't be able to handle. The waitresses leaned up against the bar facing the bar when they weren't busy and made no effort to interact with us. Finely, after waiting more than 45 minutes for miso soup, some sort of chicken appetizer and tempura, we decided it wasn't worth a minute more waiting. I walked up to a different waitress as mine was still MIA and let her know we wanted our bill. She was able to magically conjur up our chicken from the kitchen with in seconds but we already had our coats on and were out the door. MiraKura = waitresses with very poor customer service skills, and glacially slow service. I can't tell you if the food is any good, but I can tell you I'm never going back.
