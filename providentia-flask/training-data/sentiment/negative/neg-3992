What happened? Yes, it's Chinese so poor service is keeping with the status quo. But the food has gone to crap. No more taste! My seafood cake noodle had sauce that I swear was microwaved - cold on the edges but piping hot in the center and GELATINOUS! Well what the heck is the point of driving all the way out here for gross food?! AND I ordered my food stating that we don't eat pork. They bring me fried rice with pork char siu. When I ask the server what it is (thinking MAYBE it's chicken char siu?) she said, "It's pork. Just eat it." WTF?! You bet they got a tip that equaled their more crappy than usual service. After years of coming here, I'm never coming back.
