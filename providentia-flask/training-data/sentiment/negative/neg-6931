Coming back to Ohio from Canada, we were hungry and craving some vietnamese food. Given that it was fairly late (around 8:40 pm) and other Vietnamese restaurants were already closed, we decided to give this place a try. When we first entered the restaurant, we didn't receive a warm welcome at all. The guy working there didn't smile or even say a word. He simply lead us to our table and that was the only interaction we had with him. Only after a few minutes, did a girl waitress come out to help us. She was an improvement compared to the guy. My brother and I both ordered pho, pho tai bo vien and pho dac biet, respectively and both large. My other friend ordered bun bo hue. Of all the Vietnamese places we have been to, this is saltiest pho that both of us have had (coming from Vietnamese people this is pretty bad). The bun bo hue was better but the portion size was a lot smaller even though it was the same price as the large bowls of pho. The portion size of the large bowls of pho were also disappointing. The veggies that came with our dish was not in any better shape. It wasn't fresh and didn't seem to have been washed pretty well. I wouldn't recommend this place until they improve their customer service and quality of their food.
