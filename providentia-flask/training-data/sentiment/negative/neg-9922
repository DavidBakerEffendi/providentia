My food (take out) was sloppily put together and sloppily wrapped. The staff was busy ignoring me while I stood there waiting for someone to ask what I'd like. They were very busy admiring each other. The food was average to not so good. I purchase catering for my company. And I'm always looking for a new place to get food for 100 or more for meetings. Pita Jungle is NOT on my list.
