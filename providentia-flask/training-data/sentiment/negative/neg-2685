I went into Bianco on Saturday night with 2 friends. First of all, the waitress (named Maria) was not helpful at all. We asked her for wine recommendations and she recommended the most expensive bottles on the list, sorry but no. Then, when it came time to pay the waitress overcharged us (she rang in beer instead of espresso, really?) and then when we got the corrected bill, we all paid and went home. The next morning, I looked at my bank statement and realized I was over charged by THIRTY DOLLARS. I immediately went into the restaurant and the manager said he would void the charge and charge us the correct amount. Well, the sneaky guy decided to charge me $64.10 instead of $58.10. Even WITH the correct receipt he still managed to over charge me. What a f-ing joke. Learn some goddamn customer service. 

I will NEVER go to Bianco ever again.
