This place has a great atmosphere but we were here on vacation and were just so disappointed the food was so bland, our server George legit didn't care at all. Not once were we asked how our meal was just wanted to make a quick buck off of us didn't even ask his manager if I could make a special request... I expected better. A lot of work needed here. Doubt I'd ever come back.

Don't order dessert here they are impossible to eat and overpriced.
