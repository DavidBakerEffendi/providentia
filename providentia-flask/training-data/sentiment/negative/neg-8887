Freaking disgusting! I moved into the area a few months ago and tried this place one late evening and got the asada nachos and it had zero flavor. The meat tasted like it was boiled with zero seasoning. Nasty. So then today, a month later, I decide to give it one more try since I love the convenience of their drive-thru. Well same ending....gross! My son got the rolled tacos with guacamole and the guacamole tasted rancid and old. So after a few bites he threw his meal away. I got the two beef taco meal and again the beef had no flavor. I ate one taco just so I wasn't wasting all of my money and threw the rest away as well. I am praying that my son and I don't get food poisoning tonight. We will never return to eat here. Senor Tacos a few blocks away is soooooo much better.
