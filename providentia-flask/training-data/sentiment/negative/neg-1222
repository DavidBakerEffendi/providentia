Just terrible! My friend & I both ordered sweet onion chicken teriyaki sandwiches and the chicken was junky. Couldn't even bite through several pieces and the rest just didn't taste good. If we were eating there, I would have asked for another sandwich, but we brought the subs home so I couldn't. I need to email Subway because it was really bad.
