I placed an order online. Pick up in 10 to 20 minutes. 12 minutes later I arrive. 18 minutes later the owner comes walking up with two bags of ice. She asked if I placed an order online. I said yes. She just got the order. The place is still locked up. Do I want to pick it up? It has not been started.  That was 18 minutes into a 10-20 minute order.  No thanks.
