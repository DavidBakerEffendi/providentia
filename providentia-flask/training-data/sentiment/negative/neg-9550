Was so excited to hear about a new Japanese restaurant in town. Unfortunately was left with a terrible experience without even having a chance to try it. Booked a special occasion dinner for 3ppl on Nov 28/17 for Dec 15/17 @ 8pm - called & made a reservation with name & # - he even repeated my # before hanging up. Day of the dinner celebration, i call an hr before heading to the restaurant to confirm & they told me they are sorry but the restaurant is booked out for the night for a private event & they were unable to reach me because they had my # wrong. The staff i spoke to advised me that they were bought out after i made the reservation & therefore that came in higher priority than my booking. Extremely upset as it was a special occasion dinner planned & left with an hour on a Friday night to reschedule something else...What if i showed up at the restaurant with my friends to be advised that they cant serve me?....I requested to speak to the manager Edward who apologized & told me that the buy out was done prior to my reservation - conflicting information being told to me from the original staff member. I asked him to provide me the # that they apparently tried several times to reach me at to cancel - he tried to look it up but said sorry that information was deleted...just a huge disappointment & sorry definitely does not cut it.
