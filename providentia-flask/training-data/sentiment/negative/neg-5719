After years of lusting after the Bellagio buffet, I finally experienced it. I wish I hadn't.  All the reports on the Food Network and Travel Channel proved to be wrong. Brunch was severely lacking in choices, and what was available was nowhere near the top quality expectation I had for the Bellagio. As pathetic as this sounds, the mussels and clams at the Bellagio were far worse than the ones I can find at a $10.99 Chinese buffet in Houston. Mussels were tiny and flavorless. Likewise, the clams had been overcooked, were hard and had no flavor. The best cut of beef served at the Bellagio was flank steak. Let me repeat that again -- flank steak. It does not exude "fancy" as the Bellagio should. Even the buffet at the Wynn (which isn't great) served prime rib. The chicken sausage at the Bellagio was flavorless. The pork sausage was too salty as was the Tuscan sausage soup. The Wynn has a very good gelato (with a dozen or so different flavors). In contrast, the Bellagio has a soft serve machine. The only thing I ate at the Bellagio that was good was the bread pudding. Very very disappointed with the Bellagio. Highly NOT recommended.
