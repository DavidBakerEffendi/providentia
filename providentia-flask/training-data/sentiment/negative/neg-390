So, I'm not sure why ordering online causes problems for this restaurant. 
1) my confirmation does not show my entire order (no big deal if the rest was ok)
2)when I pay extra for a "regular" size bowl, and my wife orders a small you would expect them to be different sizes. Don't pay the extra $4 it's exactly the same size. 
3)when you show up after calling to make sure the confirmation email was wrong and are assured the rest of your order is on the ticket and is read back to you, it's infuriating to arrive and find they only show an appetizer in their system, reorder and wait for them to make it
4)kids meals are a joke, 3 pieces of chicken crammed in a small box full of noodles


The advertising campaign about orange chicken is laughable, Panda Express is better in so many ways. Which is sad because Pei Wei and this location used to be good. How can a "fast food" place like Panda Express be Pei Wei's prime competition?
