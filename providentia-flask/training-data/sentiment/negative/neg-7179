5:15 pm. 14 people in line. One person working to take orders and working with a woman who had at least 4 orders. 4 people messing around with stuff on the back counter. Someone comes out but they start filling online orders rather than the present customers. 7 minutes, not one of the 14 people in line is served. Employees just keep looking at the line and keep doing whatever they are doing. They are the worst burrito wrappers as well, just worth mentioning. And I was able to write all of this while still waiting.
