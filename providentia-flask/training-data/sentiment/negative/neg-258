I do not recommend this place! Walked In and sat down and was sitting for 10 min before we were greeted and then we ordered drinks and the cups were given to us dripping wet with soda running off the sides of the cup! Then she came back 20 min later to take our food order! When I looked over to see what they were doing they were watching some videos on there IPad! While all three of our drinks were empty!        Food was also not very good at all! Really.....how can u screw up chicken fingers and fry ?? Then we were ready to pay and no bill was brought to me because they were outside smoking cigarettes! So I went up and waited at the counter for them to see me up there and come inside! But wait there's more...they went back to work after smoking and didn't was there hands! Here is a couple pics I took of them watching videos and my empty drink!
