We love the other wineburger on 19th ave so we thought we would try this one out. What a huge disappointment. The servers weren't very friendly, we ordered a burger, wasn't very good. Bloody Mary was very plain. 
The place was somewhat busy but it seemed like the servers just couldn't keep up. Really just not a good experience for us. 
 Will probably be awhile before we try it again.
