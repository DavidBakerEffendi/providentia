Placed a Togo order and still waited 45 mins to get one sub. Absolute waste of time and money. I hope they replace the people who don't know what they are doing. Until then I'd rather have subway. A complete let down. So disappointed with this experience and I frequent here at least once a week. So long firehouse.
