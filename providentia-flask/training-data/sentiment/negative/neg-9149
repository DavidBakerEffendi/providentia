This restaurant deserves 0 stars. The hostess will only attend to regulars. 7 groups of regulars just bypassed the line as non-regulars are stuck piling up. As us non-regulars are waiting, you can see empty tables left and right. The restaurant itself is honestly not even that busy for a weekend. For those wanting to try regardless, I advise you to come early or don't come at all. 

In the end, some credit goes to the kitchen staff for the quality of food (mind you, it's not amazing; ok quality).
