My husband and I left here (without eating), very, very disappointed!   We attended a movie in Willougbhy Hills.  The movie ended at about 9:30 and we wanted something to eat.  My husband loves burgers and had mentioned BurgerFi several times based on passing the place, while at work.  I went to the restaurant's website to check their hours.   Saturday closing time was 11:00 p.m.  We proceeded to take the 20 minute drive to BurgerFi.  We arrived at 9:55, parked and proceeded to the door.  As we are walking to the door, we see an employee hurriedly walking to the door (from the inside). He opens the door and looks at us, as if to say, "Did you need something?"  My husband said, "we're here to eat".  The employee looks around and then says...."well, you just made it"  as if he were doing us a favor.  The hours on the door showed an 11:00 closing time, just like the website.   My response was, "that's ok, we'll pass".   There were other customers inside, seated and eating.   I'm not sure why they would advertise a certain closing time and then actually close an hour early on a Saturday night.   My biggest complaint, was the fact that we passed SO many burger places on the way to Burger Fi.  Burger Nuts (which I love), Red Robin, Burgers & Beer, Max & Erma's and the list goes on!      I'll pass on BurgerFi....
