First and last time. I like to tryout new Thai places now that I moved to south Charlotte and my favorite Thai places are no longer conveniently close to my house. I got carry out Pad See Ew after my kickball game today. I had my mouth set for that delicious Pad See Ew flavor. This dish tasted like nothing. COMPLETELY FLAVORLESS! I had to add salt and pepper to bring out some flavor. The rice noodles were mushy (wayyyyy over cooked) and there was barely any meat. Who knew Thai could be flavorless? The place was nice and clean and the staff was attentively, but that's not enough to bring me back. #ontothenextone
