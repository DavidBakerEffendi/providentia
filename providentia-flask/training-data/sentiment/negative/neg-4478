This is based on the "groupon deal"

DO NOT purchase the Groupon. This is completely false advertising. I purchased the 4 people option. The food is decent and ect. But I do not like being lured to a place for the wrong reasons. Basically you think you are getting this wonderful deal but at the end of your dinner you are hit with taxes and gratitude for party's of 4. Oh yeah how convenient right, have you heard of any restaurant of gratitude for 4 people? I have never. And maybe there are some out there maybe for HIGH END restaurants. 

So the "gratitude ect." comes out to be around $40. When we ask for the menu and prices. First there is no written menu so they can change their price whenever they feel like it. Secondly do you know how much is it to go there regularly without a coupon per person? It is around $43, now multiple this by 4 it equals $172 now minus $132 (Groupon deal) and add the $40 of "gratitude" = $172. Does not take a genius.

This Groupon should say free wine and dessert and NOT say you are getting half off of the food. Such a lie! 

If you go just go without the coupon, but from what I read and seen this place is just a trap for groupons. No wonder they are so strict on reservations they know they need to have plenty of room for the poor Groupon people.

More on the food, there is not much variety on meats, some taste dry. The salad bar is basic you probably get better salad from hometown buffet. The only good thing was the free "wine" which according to the waitress it costs $22 I looked online it was about $5. So done.
