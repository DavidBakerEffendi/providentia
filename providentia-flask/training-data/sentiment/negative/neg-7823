Chandra:  When you are asked, "Do you have a full bar?", handing me your specialty cocktails menu is NOT an answer.   And when a drink is ordered Ketel One and Tonic then that means Ketel One is the vodka requested.  Cheap whatever is not preferred and thank you for the headache and allergy reaction I was trying to avoid by not having Smirnoff, of which always gives me that reaction.

I realize this is not a place to go for fantastic food or awesome service.  That isn't the draw and this location does a fine job hiring cute girls.  My husband appreciates the view.
