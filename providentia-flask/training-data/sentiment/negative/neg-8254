Worst ever. Love JJ and this place has messed up our order and taken over an HOUR to deliver the last 3 times we've ordered from them. Their customer service is awful. I called to ask where they were after and hour and he offered to cancel my order. That's it. Not even an apology. Bad service. Bad everything.
