I got Biryani king to cater for a party I had. So I'll explain what happened below. 

My little brother once farted next to me it was a smelly and unpleasant experience. This experience oddly resurfaced when I took my first bite of biryani from Biryani king.  I'm not saying their food taste like farts, but it is what I experienced after my first bite. 

Was their food good ? 

Courtney Cox played a chef in Friends and Biryani Kings food was worst than her acting!!!!! 

Also the amount of leftovers and unhappy guest at my party told me that  " Biryani kings rice wasn't cooping with their stomachs". 

In sum, I wouldn't recommend  Biryani kings catering for big events or parties.
