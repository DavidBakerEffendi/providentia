After trying to order on Yelp and being told I'm to far (5 miles) I called and was told to try the website I am not to far. So after placing $64.00 worth of food in a cart I enter my card # and nope to far. I call back and ask why they can't take my card and order. She said the bank won't allow them to take a card over the phone. I actually am a Senior Account Executive and sign up 20+ new customers a month for Merchant Accounts. If this were my business I would not lose $60 orders because of poor service from another company. Email me if you want to double your profit otherwise I'll spend my money elsewhere!
