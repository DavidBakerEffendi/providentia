My wife brought home some food from Tazza today. She ordered two platters that cost about $15 each. The portions of meat in the platters were definitely not worth the amount of money paid. 
The man working there was also rude and did not know the difference between chicken shawarma and chicken shish tawouk and treated my wife like an idiot (she is middle eastern and knows the food).

On top of all this we were probably the most annoyed that they forgot to put the bread in our order! Which we didn't realize until after she got home.
