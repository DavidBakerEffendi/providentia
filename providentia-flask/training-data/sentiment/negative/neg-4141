If I could give a one-star rating I would, this was the worst Korean Grill House I've been to. First of all, we had to wait for 20 minutes for service despite our constant attempt to order. Second of all, they messed up our order of drinks, and didn't refill after we asked them. Third of all, as we were eating, we were told that the restaurant was closing in 15 mins, and our grill will be turned off at 12AM and we won't be able to cook any of our food which just arrived. Furthermore, when we wanted to finish cooking our food because there's just 5 minutes left, we were pushed to pay our bill. One more thing is, there was a waiter there doesn't speak English. I would never go back to this Korean Grill House.
