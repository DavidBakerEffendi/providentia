We waited 15 minutes to get our first order and then waited for another 40 mins for our shaved milk ice and the restaurant. Never have I had to wait for a dessert that long. The server also did not show interest when we ordered. Absolutely disgusted on how slow the service is. 1 star for now until they start to serve their customers with respect.
