horrible horrible business! this place is POORLY taken care of! My 17 year old son was snuck in with his friends father using his friends fathers 40 year old ID!!!! While the father was standing right there and they believed it?!! also was told later by my son they paid the girl at the door $50 to let them in.. what money making business would risk something so stupid to get shut down by letting a DRUNK 17 year old KID in there?!!? I am mind blown from it!!! They tried getting into the other strip club hustlers that was right next to it and that place said no way! then this place lets a 17 year old kid in who is obviously showing a grown mans ID! I also was speaking to the manager and the manager did not seem to give a single f***! The manager seemed alittle concerned talking to me which was probably only to tell me what I want to hear but was later told by my son all the manager did was ask my son if he's 18 my son said yes and the manager walked away!! didn't even ask for ID which my son would not have had!!!! My son has pictures from being there so I am truly considering going to the police! I would give this place a negative star if I could!
