Needed a to go order for my son, ordered a burger. I have no idea who runs this place, but they need re-training! An hour! for a to go burger, when we finally got it, it was OK and fries were soggy, like they were seating under a heating lamp. I am ok waiting for food but this was beyond ridiculous! For an average food! And bartender didn't even look like she cared after we asked to check on our food. And other people at the bar had to wait 20-30 min just to order their drinks, pretty pathetic experience overall.
