Having my sister put her food on her plate back is NOT RIGHT!  It was our first time at this place due to great yelp reviews and with us are my two sisters visiting from San Diego. How embarrassing and bad treatment of them! We arrived at approximately 2:45 pm and we paid for the lunch fee not knowing that they will be serving the dinner items shortly. My sister got up to get more food, which is poor quality, and when one of the attendants saw she had three Oyster shells on her plate, this lady told her she cannot eat them because they are only for dinner and ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO PAID FOR THE DINNER FEE CAN EAT THEM. My sister was not aware that the item she took is for dinner and apologized, but the lady took her plate away from her. This should have been explained to us when we paid. Someone should have told us that dinner will be served shortly and if we would like to pay for dinner items since we arrived close to dinner time, we could pay for the dinner fee so we can enjoy the dinner items. Naturally, my sister felt embarrassed as there were other customers around her and saw this. They made us feel like we were there to steal their poor quality, salty, over cooked food. 
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE AT ALL. POOR QUALITY FOOD, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WHO TAKES A CUSTOMER'S PLATE AWAY FROM THEM DUE TO THREE SHELLS OF OYSTERS?!?!?!!!!!
