It was not good. There were 3 customers and it still took forever to get the food. The ginger tasted metally, the sashimi was cut wrong and felt off, the wasabi had no spice, and the chimichanga roll was a cold fish stick in sushi form. We were reluctant to leave any tip but gave a little something for goodwill.
