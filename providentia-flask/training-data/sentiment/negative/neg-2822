I'm always one to give a place the benefit of the doubt, so after one horrible visit to Pickle Bills, I reluctantly agreed to go back when a friend decided to have a birthday dinner there. Never again. The food is awful.The drinks are awful. The service is awful. Oh and did I mention the food is awful? I don't get how anyone could want to come here. Sure, the atmosphere is kinda funky (and kinda dirty), and i'ts great being on the lake, but c'mon-nothing tasted fresh, from the seafood to the sides. I had a taste of pretty much everything our party ordered and this was true of everything. Soggy salads, watery, tasteless chowder, old tasting seafood. I am a huge seafood lover and there is no reason to sell frozen products in a restaurant that is supposed to be known for their seafood. 
For the life of me, I just don't get it.
