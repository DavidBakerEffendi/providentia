Always intrigued by this place.   We went on a Sunday and was not too busy.  First sign that it was not gonna be good was the locking mechanism attached to front door.  The kind that one puts a key in for someone stopping by later.  R they selling?  

Host and server were fine but the food is why you go.  

Got 12 boneless BBQ wings.  I have never had trouble cutting a boneless wing in half with a fork until this place.  They were like rocks.  BBQ sauce was good wings were not.  

Partner got Bigfoot burger. His plan was he liked everything on it so it would be good.  It is a burger on French toast with egg bacon and peanut butter.    Did not like at all.  Burger meat itself was terrible no flavor. 

I got a Texas BBQ burger  BBQ sauce onions on a big burger   Burger was blah he much better.  

Both came with fries that were also tasteless and hard.  

Even h2o tasted blah.  

Atmosphere smells like what it was a bar.  Spilled beers and urine.  

Avoid unless ur drinking
