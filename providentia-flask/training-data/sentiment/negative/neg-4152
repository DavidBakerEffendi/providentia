Do not order online from this location.  I've ordered twice and both times selected No Cranberry on the Bobbie.  On both occasions, I've received the Bobbie, left to go back to work and found the sandwich caked in cranberry.

My mistake for not checking before I left, but I asked the person at the counter who repeated no cran before I left.  

Thanks, Capriotti's on Blue Diamond, for nothing.
