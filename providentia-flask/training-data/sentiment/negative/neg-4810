If you don't serve an egg substitue, say so.
Chopped egg is not an egg substitue.
Egg Whites are not an egg substitute.

A tablespoon of watery "gravy" over a nearly flat biscuit doesn't work.
Bacon should be crisp and unburnt - ready to go.
Not charred, flaccid and greasy - as if already spent.

Scrambled eggs should be fluffy, or at least not dry and rubbery.
Unless stated on your menu, your eggs should not contain quantities of Black Pepper or other spices. This is dangerous. You don't know who might be violently allergic. Tasted bad to boot.

The chunk potatoes were undercooked, even though asked for crispy.

The tastiest part of the meal was the Chorizo potato soup. The Chorizo could have had several tablespoons of grease drained in the kitchen and would still have been quite greasy - and not floating across the plate.
Still, it was the best dish of the morningsigh.

What was looking to be a promising new place is showing signs of apathy towards is customers already. Quality slipping, lame excuses by staff "we make our own egg substitute", - it's just disappointing. I may not be back for a while.
