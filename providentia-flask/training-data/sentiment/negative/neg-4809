So 808 doesn't accept yet Groupon during lunch...it doesn't state that clearly state that on the Groupon but that's okay. 

However I called 808 because my Groupon had expired and I wanted to make sure that what I spent could still be used during lunch and I was assured I would be able to use the  value of what we spent (I was on speaker and my wife confirmed she heard the same thing). Upon arriving the clueless waitress said " I explained that you can't use both." I wouldn't have drive here across town if you would have explained that....

This is the third time something like that has happened...we will not be back!!
