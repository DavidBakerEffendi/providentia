An EMBARRASSMENT.  After a stellar evening at Buca King St, my partner and I selected Buca Yorkville to host a much anticipated couples' dinner.  We were the first table to arrive yet had to flag someone down for drinks after waiting an unacceptably long period without service.  I had to ask who our primary server was, as he was so inattentive I didnt realize he was even assigned to our table.  He was completely unhelpful; made no menu suggestions whatsoever and never made eye contact unless I waved him down.

The food was decent.  Obviously high quality ingredients but nothing stood out from our 5 course meal except the perfectly prepared octopus dish.  

We would have been willing to spend DOUBLE our final bill if only our server had taken a moment to guide us regarding portions and pairings.

Do NOT waste your time/money at this resto.  I can't believe this resto bears the same name as the establishment on King.  A total disgrace.  Were it not for the excellent company & convo I would have been completely mortified that I recommended this restaurant.
