Extremely unaccommodating! We were scolded for adding one extra chair to a big round table. The entire staff was not welcoming. Our family of 12 more than doubled their business so you'd think they want us there.  I was not allowed to drink from my own water bottle while in their restaurant. I've never experienced anything like this. We were very uncomfortable there. We asked if they could turn down the TV. They didn't, so we did. BUT then they blasted the radio.  So if you want a bad atmosphere, BLAND OVERPRICED  food and RUDE people, this is the place for you!
