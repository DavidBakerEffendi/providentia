I seriously wanted to love this place,  I begged my husband to eat here rather than the Italian place next door.  Sadly,  we were both very disappointed.   The restaurant is gorgeous and the service was nice,  but the food less than mediocre.  We ordered from the restaurant week menu.  Every dish we had was really bland,  it was as if they ran out of seasonings/spices in the kitchen.  Half the plate was filled with very plain unseasoned white rice,  then a very small portion of extremely over steamed unseasoned vegetables next to the protein which was also sadly unseasoned and unappetizing.   I feel like restaurant week is an awesome opportunity for restaurants to make a great impression,  so that patrons will return and happily pay full price.  This is definitely Not what happened at Naya and with so many other great options available here in Scottsdale,  I highly doubt we will return.
