This is not a good place. Take your money elsewhere as there are plenty of other options nearby. I've been coming to Scottsdale for about 10 years now and this past weekend I was assaulted by the bouncers at Whiskey Row for no reason whatsoever, completely unprovoked. These guys are complete punks as it was me against 8 of them. I've spent a lot of money here and am still in disbelief about what happened. I write a blog and a column in Los Angeles reviewing bars and nightclubs and will be writing an article about his place soon.
