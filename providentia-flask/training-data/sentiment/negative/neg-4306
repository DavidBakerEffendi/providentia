First time I came here there was a hair in my food. Manager was quick to have it remade and gave me two $5 gift cards as an apology. On my second visit I find out that the two gift cards EXPIRED and they made my good wrong. Of course my group was waiting on me so I cancelled my order so we could leave. No words of apology from the manager. Totally ignored by him. I'm never returning here. I'll spend my lunch money elsewhere and encourage our office to lunch elsewhere.
