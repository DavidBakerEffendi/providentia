Well, it's cheap, and novel (not too many conveyor sushi places around, and the only reason I went was because of this)  But the food, not so hot, or should I say cool...

It wasn't terribly busy when I went, and that was probably a bad thing, the conveyor is pretty big and was always full, but with few patrons the turnover was really low, and everything was warm. Nothing like a lukewarm mouthfull of clam, or tuna, or everything. All the fish was mealy tasting because of this.  

Again, it's really cheap though, so think of buffet style sushi without the benefit of an ice bath. 

With a plethora of other decent sushi options in the area, it's worth springing for the real thing, or as close to ad you can expect.
