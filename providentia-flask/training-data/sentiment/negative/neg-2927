We called in an order for a pizza last Friday at 4:15pm to be picked up at 5pm.  We arrived right at 5pm and the guy in front said it would be "5 minutes" although there was only one other table occupied in the place, and they were leaving.  Ten minutes later a woman finally came out from the back and started making our pizza, studiously avoiding looking at us or talking to us although we were standing right in front of the prep station.  After putting the pizza in the oven, she quickly went into the back room until she had to take it out.  She gave it to the young guy in front to give to us rather than facing us herself and she appeared to be the manager, no less.  SHE should have come to talk to us and apologize.  Unfortunately, this type of poor service has happened to us at this restaurant before so we won't be back.
