We only came because a friend raved about the food. Well, we were prepared to wait due to it being football sunday, but after an hour and a half after we ordered our food a manager came and said our food would be here soon. Okay 30 min later, food was cold. Not room temperature but ice cold just came out of the fridge chilly. The cheese wasn't even close to being melted. What the hell!? If you know you already messed up a tables order then don't you think you should assure that the table is taken care of?

Don't go if it's busy. The bar is only packed because of their gimmicks. They have a mechanical bull and a 2ft tall cotton candy desert,  so not wrth bad service and cold food.
