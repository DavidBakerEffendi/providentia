Called for delivery at 8pm and and after 1 hour and 30 minutes we still haven't received our pizza so we called and asked the status. They said all of a sudden it would take 2-3 hours for delivery and they NEVER told us. When we asked to speak with the manager (James) he was very rude and said, "I can only apologize so much" - the funny thing was that he only said "I'm sorry" once but regardless you can tell that all he cared about was getting off the phone. Very poor customer service. When customers call to place and order for delivery they should inform their customers of how long to expect and if an unforeseen situation came up where deliveries are going to take longer than expected they should let the customer know. Management really needs to learn some manners and talk to their customers in a polite and professional way- had that happened it would have diffused the situation at LEAST...
