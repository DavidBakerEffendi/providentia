Had a Groupon... heard great things about this place..it was Sunday at lunch time. Only one server, so service was not great. Food off the grill was disorganized, they didn't know who's food was whose. Food definitely was not worth the price. Had better at Teriyaki madness if that says anything. We ordered crab cakes(2 small cakes) as appetizer which was meh for about  $13 and truffle fries. I also ordered a light grill bowl which was about $14. It was over cooked and honestly looked unappetizing. For two people our bill was like $45.. even with a Groupon it wasn't worth it at all.
