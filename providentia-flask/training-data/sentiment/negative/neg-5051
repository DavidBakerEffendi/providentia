I really do think this place is overpriced and charge more for dinner menu of the same item for no reason at all.
Most places charge more for dinner but will give larger portion or something extra but not here.
When one of my friend ask what was the difference between lunch and dinner.
The waitress simply reply it just the price.

Will not visit again!
