Scott L's review holds true. There once was a "Judy". She was the nicest little old Italian lady and she made one of the meanest pizza's I ever had the chance to enjoy. Ahhhh old memories. 

Unfortunately, the time came for her to sell the place. Skip forward to present time and ya, it's crap. Wouldn't eat here if it was the last place that sold food. 

Avoid at all costs. Surprised they're still open though lol , who the hell eats here?
