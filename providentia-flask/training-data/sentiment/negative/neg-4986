No greeting as soon as we get in. All staff had a sour face w/a very bad attitude to match. We were very hungry but left after talking to each other and agreed how we don't need to give our money to a place like this. There was a bunch of us family too w/my mother-in-law from CA that had her heart set on korean. What a dissapoinment! At least we're now here walking distance trying out a viet cafe, already a big difference w/the staff!
