Night of visit: November 23, 2013- I MUST CONFESS, I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF ITALIAN FOOD-BUT, WITH THAT SAID, I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD, BAD AND UGLY.  I am a local looking for favorite little places to put on a 'go to' list when I want a night off the Strip.
ATMOSPHERE: Great, Old Vegas Feel....had me with eager hopes for good food to match....SIGH....
SERVICE: average - with many 'points to the MENU on the wall'.
FOOD: Ok, the menu on the wall brags of 'Free wine (white or red)', 'free soup or salad', 'free garlic bread', 'free sugar/syrup cappuccino' -ALL of this "free with your meal".  
The Lowest meal is $21.00 --this for a plate of pasta, sauce and two hard little meatballs.  Humm,  think we are really paying for all this crap.  I'm blonde but not stupid.
OK, IF the food was GOOD-I would pay twice the price for all that 'free stuff'.  But, I think I could get better pasta at one of the cheapest Buffets in town.  The spaghetti and meatball dinner was bad, but the eggplant parm was like a Banquet frozen dinner and I think $24.  hahaha   How do you spell RAGU?  
The wine is watered down cheap red, which I expected.
The garlic bread, was not toasted, but warm and dried out like it sat around in the oven and turned to hard crumbs.
Soup, canned.  Salad, blah. 
I am  totally shocked to see the high stars and great ratings for food.  I guess pasta lovers ...just plain love pasta, no matter how crappy?
Another place X'd off my 'restaurants to try list'.
