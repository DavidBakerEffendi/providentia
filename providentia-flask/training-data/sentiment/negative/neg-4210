Worst customer service! I got charged incorrectly so manager asks me for more money which I paid her $8 dollars total for a bean and cheese size burrito, no thanks! I'll stick to other places.

Message to Jake, the owener of this place.. Please train your manager she does not know how to give any customer service. You have lost one customer for life.
