I would suggest eating anywhere but here if you can. We were seated really quickly which was nice.

Our server was very polite but it seemed like she was in a huge hurry to get us in and out. We were early for our flights so it was somewhat irritating. 

Let's get to the goof which was the worst part. I ordered the the Power burger and my boyfriend ordered the Chipotle Chicken Sandwich. We were not expecting anything elaborate but the bottom buns were both burnt so bad that we couldn't even eat. The fries were okay. The best part was my beer that i ordered. The server brought it at the exact time I needed it. 

We didn't even finish the food and we just left. There didn't seem to be mean options to get a beer and a good meal.  Next time we will just stick to something simple.
