This place is really awesome for brunch! Their menu is delicious. Lunch on the other hand, an entirely different story. Wednesday, May 15th was my birthday so as a way to celebrate early, my friends took me to brunch on Tuesday, May 14th. We didn't realize the brunch menu was only available on certain days so we were really disappointed to see some of our favorites unavailable. We food we did order was average at best. The grilled cheese with bacon is very oily and not very good, the soup it comes with tasted like salty water. The mac and cheese was cold on the inside and had very little cheese. The rest of the girls ordered several other entrees and appetizers and they were all lack luster. The service was absolutely terrible. We saw our server about 3 times and constantly had to flag someone down to get a refill. Really this place is only worth it for the brunch!
