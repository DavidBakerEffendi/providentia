We ate here last Friday. There were 6 of us. The Sushi was dry, the short ribs we're tough and you couldn't even cut them with a knife (they should fall off the bone),  the prime rib had no flavor even when you put it in the aju sauce, and the salad bar didn't have any options. The only good food was pizza and made to order pasta. Way too expensive for a bad dinner at such a nice hotel. Won't be back!!!!
