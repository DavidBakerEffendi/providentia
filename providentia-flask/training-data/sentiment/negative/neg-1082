I hate to dogpile another low rating here, but it's really bad. This location is a desperate cry for help. I've tried this place at least 6-8 times. I really WANT them to be here, I WANT them to succeed. 
Assuming there's an actual owner to this franchise (where are you? Why don't you care?) or maybe if it's just one in a billion corporate locations, (district manager? Anyone?) -this place is one, giant example of "don't".   
I've had employees be rude and shirty. Trained and snippy, or untrained & incompetently simple-minded. But the worst are the ones that are both untrained AND rude.  
I've had long waits, been overcharged (even with another employee standing beside the cashier saying "You're overcharging her.") had our food prepared incorrectly.  I stopped going inside because the drive thru reviews are moderately better.  I needed a couple of 25-packs of munchkins, two separate times, for church youth activities.  Both times, the product was stale. Like... Ping pong ball stale. 
I don't know. I hear there's another donut place Opening up around the way- I don't think I'll have the heart to try DD again.
