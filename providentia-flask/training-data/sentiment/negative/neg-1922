Under new ownership! New owner is sooooo very rude! I've been doing business with this company for years! She hung up the phone on me! I'm seriously shocked at the the way she handled my concern! I was trying to speak she would over talk me. I really wish I would have gotten her name! Breaks my heart because I've sent so many people this way and will NEVER send anyone here! In fact, will tell anyone who I know that does business with them because of my referral to stop doing business with them and anyone THEY have referred! I've never been treated so badly!
