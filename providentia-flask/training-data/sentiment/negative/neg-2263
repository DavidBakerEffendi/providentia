FOOD was ok. We had the eggplant e-fu noodles which were very tasty - a bit spicy and savoury. The crispy veg with mixed veg was just OK. We got tea and a coke. I used a groupon ($15 for $30) and still needed to add $12 on top of the bill. So I feel like I paid a lot for just OK chinese food. 
SERVICE really ruined the experience. We didn't get our 2nd dish until way after the first. Every time we'd try to get someone's attention we were ignored while we saw others getting served. Same thing happened again at the end of the meal when we wanted to get a doggie bag and the bill.
BOTTOM LINE - We won't be returning and I wouldn't recommend this place unless you really are vegetarian - in that case there aren't as many dining options, I guess; and I hope you end up here at a time with better servers. I think the dim sum items people yelped about look really interesting. I wish we'd gone for dim sum instead of dinner. Unfortunately we probably won't return based on this dinner experience.
