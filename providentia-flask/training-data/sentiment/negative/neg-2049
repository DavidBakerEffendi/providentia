Bought a gift card here for my husbands birthday and were so excited to go here on a date night on a Saturday night. We show up and there is literally no parking, we had to park on the street and walk up the hill to get there. My husband brought his own clubs, 2 irons and a driver to use. As we walk up, a rude employee stops to tell us that we cannot use any drivers tonight because "to many cars were getting hit in the casino parking lot". Then she proceeded to tell is we will have to walk back to our car to drop off the driver my husband had, apparently
Not trusting him to have it in his possession. On top of that we would have to wait an hour! Sorry. We're not okay with spending $45.00 for poor service, long wait and going to a range to hit irons. It's called a DRIVING range for a reason. So disappointing and now I'm stuck with a gift card were not even looking forward to using.
