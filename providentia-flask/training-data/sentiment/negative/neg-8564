This place is absolutely terrible. Do not waste your money. If you have any respect for food or how it tastes, you'll agree with me. I could have went out back and picked a handful of slop out of the garbage and saved my money. 

At least advertise what you serve or have some respect for your restaurant and the people eating your food. I couldn't even eat it. Just threw it in the garbage where it belongs.
