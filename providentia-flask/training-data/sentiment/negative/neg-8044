Horrible experience tonight! We waited over 40 minutes for our food and the place wasn't even busy. According to our server, this happens every Monday. The kitchen just seems to fall apart she says. We asked for the check for our drinks so we could leave and they wouldn't charge us, which was the least they could do. This place is poorly managed! If you say this happens every Monday and nothing is being done about it, then maybe they should fix the problem or just close on Mondays. We will never be back again!
