I'm super sad about this review. The first time I went to Lazy Dog, it was delicious. The service was good and the food was fantastic. We went back this week with friends visiting from out of state and I was embarrassed with the entire experience. The service was terrible! We had to ask for our water to be filled and it was empty most of the time. I shouldn't have to ask for something as simple as having a full glass of water. I ordered the Brussels sprouts for my dinner,(this is what I had last time as well) they were awful. They were cooked too much that they tasted burnt. They were crispy because they were so over cooked. Plus, they didn't put any capers in the dish like they normally do. My friend ordered the starter Mac and cheese and it was the tiniest little dish ever. So not worth $7. Our other friends ordered cheese burgers which were fine but the fries were way over cooked as well. They were hard and old. Spent $77 on dinner and had instant regret. I hate when that happens. I probably won't go back after this visit which is sad because it was good the first time.
