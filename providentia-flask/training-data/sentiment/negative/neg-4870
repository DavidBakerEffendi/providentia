Atrocious. Consider the price point. Dollar for dollar, dining out just can't get any worse than this. Grease laden, obscenely over salted franchise food for twice the amount of money of your standard franchise restaurant.  The service? Poorly trained staff that has no idea what to do if a customer can't stomach the glop that just came out of the kitchen. Why are bread plates on the table if you don't serve bread with the meal. How on earth do you get off charging $7.50 for a short shot of Jack, $6.25 for fake Guinness, and $8.50 for diluted Citron. This place offers nothing to get me back in there again. It is awful and expensive. 

Oh, and one last suggestion to our server last night. If any part of a dinner entree is categorically inedible, take the WHOLE plate back to the kitchen and let the cook try to repair it. Don't break up the dish onto those little unusable bread plates and don't return with the same crap that you left with.
