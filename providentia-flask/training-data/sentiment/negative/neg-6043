The Worst risotto ever! It was undercooked covered in goat cheese which I usually love but not as the ONLY flavour. The quarter glass of wine was just cheap... My partner had the steak and meh.... 
Seriously? Where does this place get off charging what they do? Pretentious and overpriced.. if you like those qualities then you will love this joint.
