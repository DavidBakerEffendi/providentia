Arrived around 3:00 pm with husband and son.  Nice folks.  Awful food!  Really awful.  So sorry to say, but come on.  We always order a lot to try and lots of things. Crab angels were freezer burned and not crispy.  Sauce from bottle.  Salmon nigiri was okay.  Soy sauce labeled light, was definitely full sodium.  Salmon roll was mostly rice, with pencil circumference portion of salmon and the seaweed paper was chewy and horrid. The Las Vegas was the most hideous thing of an excuse for Las Vegas ever. I think that there was mix of old smoked salmon and carrots in there. It was definitely premade, and doused in dark, sweet sauce to try to hide what was going on in there. Spicy marinated pork Bulkigi was flappy and bland.  It was served with many "sides".  Some of them were OK some of them not. The kimchi was good but not what we know to be quality  kimchi.  Not fermented long enough. Portions were measly. Rice was too sticky and falling apart.  I think they may know that they are getting by with substandard overall food. They ARE really nice. But but we are not likely to ever return. Seems like this is most likely the way it is every day.  Not good for sushi - for sure.
