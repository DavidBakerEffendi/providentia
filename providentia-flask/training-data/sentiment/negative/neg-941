Went in on a Sunday afternoon for dinner. The place wasn't busy at all; we sat at the bar. After being handed menus, 3 waiters, including the bartender never took our order. After sitting for over 10 minutes without one person taking our drink order, a couple walked in and the bartender immediately made conversation and got their drinks. They must be regulars because he knew what they wanted to drink. We got up afterwards and left as waiters were gathered talking amongst themselves and didnt seem to care that customers were leaving. We drove across the parking lot to Islands Burgers and was seated, served and had our order put in within 8 minutes.
