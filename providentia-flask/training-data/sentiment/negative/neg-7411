I used the app to order my pizzas. The wait time 31-45 minutes.I called the store. I was put on hold for 7 minutes. I called back explained that I was on hold & nobody returned. No acknowledgement that happened. The man on the phone just confirmed my name & delivery address & explained that my pizza was out for delivery along with 2 other orders. I said it's been just over an hour & the wait time was 45. Did he know where in the delivery order I landed or if I could pick up my pizzas? He said he couldn't do either. Just didn't speak after letting me know the system doesn't reflect true delivery times. That they were an hour to hour & 30 right now. Absolutely no customer service what so ever. Super disappointed.
