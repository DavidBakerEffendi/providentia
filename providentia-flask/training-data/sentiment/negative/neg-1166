Used to be our place for the occasional fake Asian food experience when we couldn't afford real authentic and didn't want to steep to Panda Express. However, this time we left feeling very disappointed. My brother got a noodle dish that was subpar but passable. It was my chicken that made us want to leave and never come back. It was sweet and sour chicken with rice. The chicken was dry, the rice was even more so which we didn't know was possible. The ratio of meat to rice was also ridiculous for the price, barely any meat on the dish. Don't know if we will be coming back for awhile.
