Indian lady at counter...
Lady like her will only have negative rating for business. Don't know how to deal with customers.
We went for dosa lunch buffet and after serving 2 dosa they said it will be extra charge plus buffet charge in middle of lunch .
They don't understand what buffet means and the lady kept coming to our table to tell us you can take once per dish in buffet.
WILL NEVER GO AGAIN AND I SUGGEST EVERY ONE TO STAY AWAY FROM THEIR BAD TRICKS TO CHAGRE EXTRA.
