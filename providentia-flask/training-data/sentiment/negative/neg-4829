If I could leave a half star I would...sat at the bar and once we got water the bar tenders didn't check back with our drink and food order for about 20 min until we had to tell someone and then once we got food she asked if we needed anything and hasn't been back. Currently waiting to get our tab and has taken another 20min...Very unfortunate for an awesome country bar to have very poor service!! Even my friend that lives in Scottsdale for the past 3 years says that every time she comes here the bartenders are very very bad at serving the customers at he bar. Maybe they don't want to serve a group of four girl with no men around?

Big country fan!!! Unfortunately, not the place for me :(

Mac and cheese was good.
