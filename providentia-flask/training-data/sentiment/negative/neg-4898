Many issues with Pepe's. First, prices are quite high for the type of food/restaurant it is. Second, the amount of food for the price is small, kid size. Third, my food was cold. The bean burrito was cold in the middle. Lastly, they charge a 50 cents service fee for using my debit card. My bill was just over 9 dollars. That's over 5% of my bill. I own a business, and fees are not 5%. I will not go back.
