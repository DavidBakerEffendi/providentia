I will start by saying the food here was delicious (I had sweet potato fries, crispy egg rolls and wings with house sauce and Sriracha). Again, the food was delicious....until I found an insect on the lettuce that came with my crispy egg rolls. Of course this turned my stomach and I completely lost my appetite. I returned all of the food to the server and didn't make a big deal about it. That is until I was informed that because I ate 3 of the wings and some of the fries, I would still be charged for the meal, per the "owner's policy."  I don't know of any person who could complete their meal after finding a bug in their food. The manager came to speak with me and informed that he took the charge off for the egg rolls but will still charge me for the fries and wings. Ummm, NO!!  I sent the food back not because I didn't like it, I didn't like the bug on my flipping plate!!!  The manager yet again informed me of the "owner's policy" and refused to side with me, the customer. After a few minutes of "back and forth" with me, he did however agree to take the charge for the fries off as well. Since I originally sent the wings back, and they still were going to charge me for them, I requested they make me another batch. Long story short, it's pretty sad that the "owner" would risk losing potential customers over this. He should be more concerned about keeping insects out of his foods. Needless to say, I will NEVER come back to this place again.
