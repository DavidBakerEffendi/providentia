The Steak house at Circus Circus was closed and we wanted to know of a place we could still get a good steak at 11 p.m. The maitre d' recommended we try Peppermill.  The restaurant was crowded but there wasn't a wait to get a table. Ordering drinks took forever because the waitress had to get a separate "cocktail waitress" to take our alcoholic drink order. One of our friends joked she wouldn't order a steak based on what she saw walking to our table. The price for a steak dinner ranged from $26 to $29. I commented back to her for that price how could the steaks be bad. Boy was I wrong. I order a New York steak and shrimp dinner for $29. The steak was the size you would get for a $9.99 steak and eggs breakfast. To say this was over priced is an understatement. I know size isn't everything but this steak didn't even taste good. The other dinners (chicken nachos and a fresh fruit platter)  were no better.  If that wasn't bad enough our cocktails were of the premixed straight from the fountain gun dispenser type. Needless to say no one finished their food or drinks. What a waste of money. As for the maitre d' I wonder if he gets some sort of kick back for sending people to this place. So much for asking a local where to eat.
