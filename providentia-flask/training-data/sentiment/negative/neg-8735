I don't know where these guys are from but they made the worst bimbimbap i've ever tasted - How and why is this item on their daily specials?  Unseasoned ground beef and NO toppings? You would think something like this was made by someone who doesn't know what its suppose to taste like, but they are Korean! Will never go back and they couldn't convince me to eat it if they paid me.

Worst $10 i've ever spent
