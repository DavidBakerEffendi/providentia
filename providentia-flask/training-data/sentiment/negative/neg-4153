I hate that this is my very first negative review here but it was such a bad experience that I was itching to get out of Jenni Pho! You can ask anyone that I know and 10 out 10 will tell you that I am in no way a picky person. So...that means a lot. 

Drinks came after food....had to remind her twice we ordered a beer and 3 Thai teas. 6 people but spoons and forks for 3 people? Table was so uneven that drinks and bowls kept almost landing onto my lap. Had to put Every Single Thing on napkins to keep them from sliding. 4 adults and 2 small children meant automatic 18% gratuity. 

Omg...the food...Tom Yum Soup is meant to be Sweet/Sour/Spicy but all 4 of us agreed that it was just spicy water with whatever leftover stuff they had. Not at all sour which is the signature taste of tom yum soup. The Bo Luc Lac (Shaking Beef) was plain and was probably still Mooing when it got to the table. The Thai tea had too much Water to powder ratio. (There was no way that was freshly brewed) Will be the last time I come here. Sorry!
