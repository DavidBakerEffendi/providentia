I will not return to this location. The service was HORRIBLE!!!!!  The guy behind the counter took forever Washington this hands applying sanitizer then putting on gloves. Then he waited until the worker before him finished before he jumped in to help. The line was getting long. After paying instead of giving me my credit card back he just dropped it on the counter. No apologies or anything. He did the same with the receipt. I will NOT be back. Cashier name in receipt is MITCHELL.
