If you have 25+ minutes to spare waiting in line (while the drive thru is built so you can't escape) then it's fine if you want a rude employee to give you half your food. 
But hey, if quesadillas that are cold in the middle is appetizing to you then this is your place. I suggest driving the mile or two to swensons!
