My boyfriend and I stopped by here because of the great reviews and we were sorely disappointed. We both ordered breakfast, I had the works with potatoes and my boyfriend got a waffle with a side of biscuits and gravy which came with 2 eggs and 1 slice of ham. After waiting 30 minutes for them to cook our meal they gave us cold biscuits and gravy. My sandwich was essentially flavorless and my potatoes were both undercooked and almost completely naked of seasoning. My boyfriend's waffle was completely overcooked as well with it becoming hard as a rock. I'd like to say the service was good but the server we had was very inattentive and often times I waited on him to return.

Definitely won't be back. Wasn't a good meal in the slightest. Would have rather ate at Dennys.
