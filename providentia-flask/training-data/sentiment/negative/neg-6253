Took a group of clients there when we were in town recently. I had been there before and had a good meal for a fair price. This time we had a fast talking waiter who ran our bill up to $200/person by constantly suggesting items that were not on the menu. He upgraded everything. We wanted to order a few sushi rolls and he suggested a sushi platter. This worked out to $300 for 6 people when the rolls were all less than $20. We were way over charged. He suggested adding a steak, which was a $95 ribeye. When you are with clients, you can't ask how much everything is.  When the bill came, I was absolutely shocked. I will never eat there again or recommend to anyone.  The manager was of little help in resolving our bill beyond admitting we were unfairly charged for the sushi, he dropped the price a little. When you cheat customers you should do more than that for them.
