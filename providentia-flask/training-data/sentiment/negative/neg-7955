I have been to many Japanese restaurant before and this one is so far the worst! The service is awful. Took them 40 mins to serve our food then another 30 min waiting to get a check. There was only a few table of people inside.The food was a total waste too. Everything was too salty. They put way too much flour to fry the tiny pieces of seafood just to make them look bigger, sure is a good way to save them $$$. I also ordered a lamb rack. On the menu it shows a rack of lamb. But the actual plate was filled with pre cooked hibachi rice with 3 skinny pieces of lamb chops.And of course the meat tasted like nothing but a chunk of salt. After I walked out of there my hair and my clothes smelled like that oily hibachi. Even though I did not sit at the hibachi table at all!
