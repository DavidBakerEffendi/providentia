Honestly the worst pad thai I've ever had. I wasn't expecting much. I knew I was in a food court and it wasn't going to be great, but it was SO flavourless, and the veggies and tofu were actually cold, despite me seeing the guy fry it all up in front of me.

I'm not really one to waste food, but I ate three bites and that was all I could do.
