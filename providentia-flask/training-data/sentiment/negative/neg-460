This looked like a neat place for dessert when my friends and I walked by on the way to dinner. We decided to try this place instead of going for bingsu. 

The decor is funky with the walls that looks like it has foliage growing on it. There seems to be 2 main flavours of desserts, mango and durian. 

I know that food that is served doesn't necessarily look like the photos on menus but the mango pancake was very different. What my friend got on the plate looked very much like a crepe cake with thin pieces of mango put in between the layers. She said that there wasn't much flavour except for the mangoes. I'm no chef but maybe the cream could've been infused with mango to bring out the flavour more. 

As for the other desserts, my friends said that it was alright, no terrible but not excellent either. The photos on the menu must've been taken up close because the desserts look much bigger than what is actually served. 

We came to the consensus that we were not smiling after dining here.
