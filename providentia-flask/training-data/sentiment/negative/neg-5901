The bat in the 2nd floor got closed. They moved it to this small dining area. Not a cool place to hangout here anymore. I'm taking my hard earned money and friends somewhere else. Not coming back until the bat area is open again. It's uncomfortable that you can't sit infront of the bartender, no small talks. I have to get up and walk up to get a drink or wait on my ass until someone comes by. So annoying.
