One star for cleanliness and fast service. Taco Bell is way better than this place. I had two ground beef tacos with rice and refried beans for lunch today. It was my first visit here. The taco meat was not seasoned very well- bland. As we're the beans and rice too. It's as if your Italian grandma was making tacos at home for the first time and she didn't know what she was doing! I will stick with Old Pueblo and Se√±or Taco, thank you very much...
