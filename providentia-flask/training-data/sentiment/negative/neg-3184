The food is disgusting and the service is terrible. Went through the drive thru yesterday and she was asking me if "that would complete my order" before even asking what I wanted to drink with my combo, which I would have gladly told her voluntarily if she wouldn't have continued to interrupt me while I was speaking to keep asking if that was all. The chicken nuggets were burnt and gross. I got one sauce for 10 nuggets and didn't get a drink with mine because I was so sick of her interrupting me. Couldn't finish the nuggets because I ran out of sauce after drenching the first three and ran out of our then shared drink too. Fast food is fast food but don't burn it and if you'd let people finish ordering you wouldn't have to keep asking if that's all.
