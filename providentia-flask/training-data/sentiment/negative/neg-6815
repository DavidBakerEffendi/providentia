Was in there this morning and they asked me to go to the side to wait for my order. At least 5 of the cars behind me got served and were passing me. I had to call them and remind them that I was outside waiting. All I ordered was a coffee, mcmuffin, & scrambled eggs. It doesnt make sense to me that I had to wait ten minutes in my car while the ppl behind me were getting their food.
