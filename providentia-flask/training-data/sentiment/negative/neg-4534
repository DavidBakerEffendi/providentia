Slow, very slow. Was there at 11:40 they took our order at 12:00, the food came to the table at 12:30. Food was very bland and they had no condiments on table, no chili oil, no white pepper, no Sriracha and not even salt or black pepper. Extremely over priced. What would normally be a $20 lunch for two people cost $45 without beverages, only water. Maybe they didn't add spices because I was a gringo but I prefer authentic, not American style. Very disappointed.
