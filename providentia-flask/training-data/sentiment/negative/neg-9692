I ordered some late munchies for my wife and I from the JVG (Johnny Vegas Grill) and the food was excellent, but that's for a different review. After picking up my food I decided to stop by the bar. The bartender (who's name I don't know because he never said anything) was busy helping a guy that just walked in. After making his drinks and speaking to the other two guests he sits down and continues his conversation. 

10 minutes and 40 bucks later, no drink, no approach, no service. And that's the extent of my review because I can't even describe anything of substance. In fact the guy was rude to the one guy he was talking to. Oh well never again.
