Not impressed at all with this location. My wife and I went here for a Sunday morning brunch and the service was atrocious. The server Julie R. was slow. She did not acknowledge us for quite some time upon being seated, did not refill our waters appropriately, did not do table checks, and seemed generally uninterested in customer service. 

What really bothered me is that I left her a small tip to recognize the unacceptable service (in reality it should have been zero) and she gave me a sarcastic "thanks" with an eye roll. Will not be back at this location again.
