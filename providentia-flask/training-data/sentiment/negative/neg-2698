Went into this smiths for the first time, as I had just moved over to this side of town. I just finished dinner and wanted to grab a couple things. I wasn't sure what time they closed, but knew that most Smith's were 24 hours. As I am getting the things I need, an announcement comes across the store and says "we will be closing in 7 minutes". I said to myself well I guess they close at midnight and proceeded to turn down another isle to find rice real quick. As I turn down the isle, an associate looks at me and says "we are closing in like 2 minutes". I thought to myself how rude. They just made an announcement and it's not past close.  I felt so rushed that I didn't even want to look to see  where the bread isle was or get bread. By  the time I got to the register it was 3 minutes until close and the associates were just giving the most hateful glares. This was my first and last time in that smiths. Today I went to Albertsons and got  the bread that I wasn't able to get because I was so rudely rushed out of the store and was informed that they won't even say anything to employees that are in the store shopping even after close.  There was absolutely no reason for that employee to say that to me less than A minutes after the announcement was just made!  I do not make it a common occurrence to patronize establishments right at close, but like I said I was new to this area and I had just finished dinner right next door.  I will not be back to this smiths and I definitely think they should learn how to treat paying customers!
