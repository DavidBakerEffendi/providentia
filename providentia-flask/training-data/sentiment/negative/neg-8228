What can I say. I love Chick-fil-A was so excited to see one down here in the Third/Fourth Ward. What a let down... :-(

This is not your typical Chick-fil-A. This is an express one. Very different than your regular Chick-fil-A restaurants. This place was not busy or packed thinking that in this area is busier during the week from Mon-Friday versus the weekend which they are not even open here.

First time here, walked in. One staff busy putting away condiments and another behind the food counter. Not real friendly here. So use to a Hello or Welcome at every single Chick-fil-A I been to. This is what you do here- get stuff, bag it, and ask them to ring you up. There are no trays here. Make sure you do not hold too much stuff or you be dropping things.

The fries are placed out in a bin/tray with heated lamps above, and chicken already in bags and placed out for patrons to help themselves (no idea how long they sitting out there). Saw chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets. Fridge close by with stack of three small salads.

Wonder if the food is actually cooked here or just reheated.

Bags lined up by the cash register. Went to asked the guy busy putting away condiments or fixing that area. "Is this a grab, go and check yourself out"? He goes yes.

Chicken sandwich was dry. Like I said who know how long the chicken is sitting out there. Was there at 1:30 PM.

This is a stand alone store. No drive through.

Will not be back. Rather go to a real Chick-fil-A restaurant than an express one.

Express places in NYC are so much nicer. Very popular. Life in the fast lane in NYC, people are nicer and interact with their customers. Ask them if they need assistance when they look confused.
