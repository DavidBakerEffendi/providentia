Our family of 5 waited patiently as the rude staff kept seating parties of two than parties of four who walked in WAY after us. We asked if we could pull a table together and they said NO. A military veteran and his family being mistreated like that was uncalled for. We walked out after being left standing for almost half an hour and what a BAD rap this location gives to other locations who are more respectful and accommodating.. Shame on you!
