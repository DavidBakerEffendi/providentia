Suppose to be a dive sports bar. If ur a metal or hard rock fan and try to play music on the jukebox,the owner has instructed the staff to skip it. They allow, classic rock, rap and country..if the bar is going to treat the customers like that then maybe he needs to specify that he runs a ghetto ass bar. The fact that I was told that I couldnt listen to what was on the jukebox was baloney. My friends play darts for this bar. The owner is an ass. He lost several customers tonight. And the fact that it was also my birthday too made things worse. Wouldn't recommend this bar.
