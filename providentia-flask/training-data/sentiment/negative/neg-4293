Finally a new breakfast place!  But oh, the disappointment...
Have tried Eggsasy 3 times, hoping each time that the next visit would be better.  
The decor was great, but wish they would have put as much effort into the food.  
Hostesses dressed like nightclub cocktail waitresses at 8:00 in the morning?  Um, ok.
Menu was very large and had lots of options, unfortunately it has gotten them in trouble, as nothing I have ordered was any where near delicious.  Super loud in the dining room.  And very exspensive for sub-par food.  This kitchen needs to revamp the menu so they can focus on quality, not quantity!
