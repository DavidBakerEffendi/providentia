NO MEAL DEAL?!?!?  $7.50 for a 6" sub?  NO REFILLS?  what is going on here?  this is the subway from the twilight zone.  This subway is located in the Southwest Airlines terminal and is the worst subway in the world.  the food itself is okay, but you wait FOREVER.  talk about inefficiencies!  

(1) there is a separate queue for pilots and flight attendants, but their orders get mixed into the queue of regular customers.  this caused major backups and even instances where the sandwich maker mixed up pilot sandwiches with regular customers!
(2) we waited FOREVER.  i think 30 minutes? and we were only 8 deep when we joined the line
(3) there is no number three...just turn around and go to the sbarro's!  at least you get a whole slice of pizza and a drink for $7.50!
