Low rating for the service. At the bar and only 5 other people and three tables with people behind me yet the bartender was super distracted.  I ordered traditional, he asked me again because he forgot to put my order in and boneless came out. He fixed it quick but had to ask for napkins went through those quick he walked by enough to know I needed more but I had to ask anyway. I even bought some sauce for the fundraiser but had to wait to pay my tab while he chatted with a server with no order then only brought my credit card slip and not my itemized tab. Sorry for bashing but disappointing
