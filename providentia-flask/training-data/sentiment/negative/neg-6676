This place has to be the worst establishment in the whole world. I mean not only are the waitresses rude and trashy the security does a horrible job as well. They accused my good friend of being drunk when he had not even had a sip of alcohol. He was actually the whole groups DD. The security was very rude to him during this too. My friend was very embarressed because he had not even been drinking and was now the reason that the whole group had to leave. It was an awful experience. Me and my friends will never be back to this place. I'm surely going to recommend that everyone I know not eat here or drink here. The most unprofessional professionals there are.
