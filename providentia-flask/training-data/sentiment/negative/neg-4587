Terrible. Save your money, this is not Italian food. Maybe back in the day it was good, don't know who owns this restaurant and really don't care. The bread was soggy, the chicken was swimming in the sauce, way too much cheese, the small side order of pasta was the only thing cooked correctly (al dente),the coffee (brown water) was awful(plus you do not serve Capuccino with cold whip cream on top or with dinner (the server just plop the cup in front of us and never took the dirty dishes. Had to clean our own table and put our dirty dishes on the next table. Poor service, it is a tourist trap. I am a local and try the out of the way restaurant to take out of town guests. Will never come back. Had heard so much about this rest. we had to try it and see if we will bring out of town guests here, NOPE! Obviously they do not care, the gimmick with the wine, is just that, if you really are into wine, save yourself money and go somewhere else and have a decent meal. LV has tons of great restaurants that really cook great Italian food and are priced correctly.
