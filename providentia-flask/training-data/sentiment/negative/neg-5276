Can't understand the Pizza Hut hype. Placed an order for myself and my toddler. Order was confirmed at 6:40pm...... Pizza showed up at 8:10, lukewarm at best, greasy hand prints on the box, tasted disgusting, and after 3 phonecalls, I got my partial credit. Lesson learned....  Instead of crediting people, work on your pizza making, possibly staff training. 
 And for the excuse from your staff that the "app and pc don't really communicate" so times can greatly vary from what your confirmation states..... Get your IT staff looking into this promptly! Poor excuse.

Once bitten, twice shy.
