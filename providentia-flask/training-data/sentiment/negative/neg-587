We went on a Sunday and only 1 person works the bar and restaurant on Sundays (I asked). She did the best she could but the service was slow and I didn't get any refills. I felt really bad asking her for anything because she was running like crazy. The server also couldn't answer any questions about the steaks on the menu even though she ran to the kitchen to ask the cook. We ordered sandwiches which were just ok. He got a burger and I got the portobello sandwich. Not much taste and mine was lukewarm. We ordered dessert as well. The lava cake ala mode. It was delicious but soooo tiny! The ice cream was literally 2 bites. I was sad. I definitely won't go back with all the other wonderful choices in Cleveland.
