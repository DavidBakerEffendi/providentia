I knew it was pricey going in but $7 for a kids grilled cheese (literally 2 pieces of bread and a slice of cheese) and $6 for a side of mashed potatoes for an 8 year old. The food was over priced for the bland dinner I got. Add to that the fact our medium burger was almost moo - ing and I am over it. Tried to go on a limb, try something new. What a bust.
