I have been at this establishment twice in the last month to see the band Custard Pie. I dine out on a very frequent basis. Here are some of my observations. There is zero eye contact from the bartenders. Zero! I should not have to wave to order a drink. Focus on customer service! It costs zero money. 

One of the bartenders slipped on the floor and fell hard and hit her head. I did not see a supervisor or manager check on the employee. I asked her if she was okay and if she required medical attention. She said no. Where are the walk off mats behind the bar? The safety and security of your associates should be a very important factor. Someone finally brought one walk off may to the bar and they place a cardboard box on the floor. 

The floors on the side hallways are slippery as well. Someone needs to address what floor cleaner is being utilized on the floors and behind the bar. 

I orders wings on my last two visits. It took 30 and the second time 40 minutes to receive my order. I did not see many food orders coming out to the dining room. Who is managing the kitchen operations. It shouldn't take that long to fry and sauce wings. 

A kitchen associate came out to the bar to empty the trash. However, he did not pick up the garbage that didn't make it into the trash can. Why didn't he or the bartenders pick up the garbage. Please see the pictures. The reason is that they don't take pride in their job or the establishment. Someone needs to come in and clean up this restaurant. Managment and ownership needs to address these issues ASAP!
