B.A.R.F. 

Somehow we ended up here on 12.28.2008 instead of Ichiza (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ichiza-las-vegas) or Harbor Palace (http://www.yelp.com/biz/harbor-palace-seafood-restaurant-las-vegas).  BIG Mistake.  

Long waits.  Poor service.  *Mediocre* food.  

This is nothing like the Sam Woo BBQ in the Los Angeles Chinatown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sam-woo-b-b-q-restaurant-los-angeles), which I was quite fond of from 1990-1999. 

1 STAR for the decent Pork Chop with Spicy Salt.  

Better food and better service at Food Express (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/food-express-chinese-restaurant-las-vegas).  

No go for Sam Woo LV.
