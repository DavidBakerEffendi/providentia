Horrible airport burrito I ever had. The shop looks nice with catchy phrases like 360 gourmet ingredients and what not but the taste is awful. Even worse, they charge you extra for everything, right from cheese, sauce, and guac. An usual burrito with all the usual ingredients will make it to $20 here. Such a daytime robbery for a tasteless burrito. Grab a flatbread at the Einstein bagels right across and you will be happy you did that.
