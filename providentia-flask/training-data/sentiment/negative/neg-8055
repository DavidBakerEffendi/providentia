Yesterday we went to Eggstasy of Mother's Day and it was, hands down, the WORST breakfast we have ever had as a family. We all knew it was going to be busy because of the Holiday but the service was so poor. We were missing 4 sides of pancakes, all of which were eventually cancelled because they would've come out 45 minutes after our meal. Our waitress never offered to have the manager come over and never tried to accommodate us for the errors. They also had a little boy, maybe 10 years old, who was working in the back trying help get food out. My chair was diagonal to him and I witnessed him either pick or wipe his nose 10 times. It was so DISGUSTING! I am very disappointed in this place. We will never go back.
