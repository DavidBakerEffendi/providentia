Everyone gave it great stars, the service was terrible as was the food I ate , Everyone raved about the mussels. The worst ever. fishy tasting over cooked couldn't eat it pita pita garlic triangles  really? and how are you soaking up the sauce? I am a mussel lover grew up in the northwest so that it self ruined it their.   It took for ever to get the food despite their was no one in the restaurant. God forbid you order a drink they poor to a tee measure everything and over charge. The pad Thai no flavor little bang for the buck go to VIG  on 44th street much better better and it isn't even Asian.  We came because it had good rating clearly people don't know food or they had bad cooks that day.   I would not recommend or ever go there again.
