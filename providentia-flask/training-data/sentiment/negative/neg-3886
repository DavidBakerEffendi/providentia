Each time we have been to this restaurant prior to a coyotes game we have been double charged. The second charge usually shows up a day after the first. I understand them needing to verify the card for a$1 due to those who may walk out without paying. This past weekend when the waitress (who was very nice) asked for the card, we said sure no problem, but don't double charge kind of as a joke. Well guess what last night there was a double charge hit the card. Two drinks should not cost $70.00. If this only happened once, we would blow it off but this has been twice now. We will not be returning.

It is a shame because the wings and drinks are very good but it is not worth the hassle of disputing the charges.
