My husband said he wanted to try this place, so we ended up going for dinner last night. UNDERWHELMED.
We ordered the Beast footlong dog and 2 White Hors because I loves brats and stadium mustard along with an iced tea and a strawberry shake...$19...hmmm...no sides included...ok.
It took about 10 min to get our dogs, which looked tasty but ended up be tasteless. My bratwurst has no flavor at all, the stadium mustard wasn't spicy at all, even the diced onions on top seemed flavorless. My husbands footlong was also underwhelming and left us both hungry and looking for something more. Though there were only 2 other patrons all the tables were dirty and the entire staff was sitting behind the counter hanging out instead of checking on tables or cleaning...we won't be back
