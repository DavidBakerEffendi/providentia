This place is terrible!!!!! I mean terrible!!!!
Ordered the matzo ball soup to go and it has absolutely NO flavor!! In fact they put grilled chicken in the broth??? Of course that tells you they don't make the broth (which tasted like soapy water).  Prob worst matzo ball soup I've had, just dumped it out! 
Being Jewish, I'm ashamed this place is still in business!!!
