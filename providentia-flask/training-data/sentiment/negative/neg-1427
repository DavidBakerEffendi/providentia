Maybe I went on a bad day or I'm being overly critical, but the service was horrible. The pho was also horrible. 

Pho is pho. The noodles, meat and vegetables are the same everywhere you go. The only way you tell if the pho is good is through the broth. The pho here was translucent and tasteless even with all the MSG they put in there to mask their laziness. 

But yeah, sure. If you're an elderly white couple, then they will scream hello and thank you. I guess that means good service.
