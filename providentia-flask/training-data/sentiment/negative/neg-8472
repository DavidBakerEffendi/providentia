Worst service I've ever received. The employee was rude, and should have just stayed home if he was going to service every single customer the way he did us. We were a party of 6 and he gave us all equally the crappiest service. He was not friendly, and should not work in the service industry. He acted like we were interrupting his day. Please reconsider training in the customer service field, your donuts are amazing but unfortunately the employees are dimming the light of this place. I understand the service industry isn't the ideal work place however, he should reconsider his career path.
