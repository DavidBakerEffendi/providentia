It is pricey for what you get. 

The quality of the food is just not there for the price you pay. For starters I chosen the surprise seafood, and receieved 3 breaded shrimp. For the main course the filet mignon was not cooked correctly (asked for med rare) lots of potato and broccoli. For dessert the sorbet, tasted like store bought tub of ice cream with canned fruit. 

The biggest upset was that we were seated before the couple beside us and they were served way before us and finished their dinner when we were still waiting for our main course. Even our drinks came after theirs.. 
It is obviously impossible to wave the waiter down to settle these issues and we were also forced to tip 20%.
