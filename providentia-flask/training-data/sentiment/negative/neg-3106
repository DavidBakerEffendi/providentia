Food poisoning!!! Threw up afterwards!

Bought their already-prepared food: marinate kimchee tofu, raw octopus, salted cucumber, tofu soup, and seafood pancake . Ate it around 9pm on Saturday night at their dining area. Threw up 3 hours later at home... Felt miserable. 

Either their seafood is unsanitary or there may have been cross contamination..

I will call the southern Nevada health district and file a complaint. 

I brought all the prepped food back, but the lady named Grace only took back and returned the prepped food. She refused to refund my whole grocery bill of $40+ dollar. For all the pain, vomiting, light-headedness, nausea that I've been through, it was only little to ask for. In fact, I would pay her $40 to shove that shit down her throat and she can tell me how food poisoning feels.
