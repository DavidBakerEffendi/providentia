They are opened at 11am so we decided to get there at 11:30am.  They were not opened yet.  M spoke to an employee and they said they have been waiting for someone to open the place since 10am.  I did not want to wait because I needed to return to work.  We decided to walk down to try Rice Paper.  I guess next time we will call to make sure they are open first.
