Me and the wifey went on the nautica queen on saturday, june 5th. We did not like it.  The food was worst than buffet food or the corner chinese restaurant.  Not to mention, we paid almost $50 per person, including another $10 to park.  The view itself from the boat was nice, but the boat, food and music was not good at all.  I would recommend other alternatives to seeing the cleveland skyline instead of paying $50 for a boring boat ride.  sorry, but this is my experience.
