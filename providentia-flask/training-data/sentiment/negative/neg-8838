Depressing. We came here all the time while visiting family and LOVED IT. Now that it has changed to the new menu and name, it just isn't the same. My in laws used to come here several times a week and have decided they need a new place as well. 

They have removed all of our favorites from the menu and replaced them with healthier options which would be awesome, but they fail at making them work. Raw pancakes, under cooked bacon, brown avocado...

Disappointed
