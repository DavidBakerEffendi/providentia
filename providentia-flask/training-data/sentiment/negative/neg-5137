Drive threw service sucks..
Told me to pull up so they could make my food fresh. Sat for 20-25 minutes nobody else pulled up behind me the whole time so I pulled back to see them just hanging out.
I banged on the drive threw window and demanded my money back.  They stated that they forgot about me and would not charge me, but would give me my meal for free.
Then I sat there for another 10 minutes.
I said f this and drove off and went somewhere else and got my food fresh and fast.
Well the next day checked my account sure enough they took the Money out of my account. Called and spoke to a manager who stated I would get my money back but it would take 3-5 days, well it took 5 and it was about a $1.00 short.  The manager told me she would send me a gift card or free meal voucher and have yet to see it.  I used to frequent Arby's A Lot have not will not be back and not just this store ... All of them.
Can't wait till machine's take over so we can get rid of these uneducated pimple poppers.
What the hell and they want $15.00 an hr.
Go to school fool.
