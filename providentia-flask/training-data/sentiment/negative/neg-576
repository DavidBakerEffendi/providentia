Went the other day to get lunch and unfortunately had to deal with kenia. Asked for the Shanghai beef she said it would be 6mins said that was fine she rolled her eyes and huffed. She informed me that it was an extra charge again said that was fine. And again got the same attitude. When the food finally arrived I was checking the bag for sauces and again in her oh so pleasant attitude informed me it was there. Since I was already tired of dealing with miss I hate my job lady I left, only to find out no soy sauce and no teriyaki sauce for the chicken. Now I called and spoke to the Assistant manager and she informed me she is still training the un pleasant person. I guess kenia doesn't realize that with out customers you have no job!!!!  And if you are still in training you might want to train on being a nicer person!!!!
