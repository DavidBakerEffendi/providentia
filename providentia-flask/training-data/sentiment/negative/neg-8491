This location was horrible. I went in around 12:40 pm and they had no food. I ordered chow mien and it was all noodles. No veggies at all and you could tell how old and oily it was. There was no meat to choose from so I picked mushroom chicken and orange chicken. both tasted old. my orange chicken was hard like rocks. The cashier didn't even speak to me or greet me. A roll of toilet paper has more personality than her. and it looked like she was there alone. Ate here as a last resort but I won't be back. If I wanted old left over food I would've out of a trash can!!!
