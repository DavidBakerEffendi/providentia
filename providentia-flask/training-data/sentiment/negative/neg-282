I came here with my mother for coffee slightly before the dinner hour. The espresso machine at Chabichou was broken so The Boulevard Cafe seemed like an okay option. 

I can't speak for the food but it was the single worst cup of coffee I have ever had, and that is saying something. It literally tasted like my Americano was made out of yesterdays dishwater, totally flavourless. Unless you count yucky-blahness as a flavor. 

The service was good. It was nice of them to seat us just for coffee so close to the dinner rush, but come on guys. You'd think a restaurant like this could serve up something better then sludge.
