I have eaten middle eastern food all over Toronto. Came here for lunch and ordered a simple Swarma. While waiting out of curiously and was surprised at the low scoring reviews. Then my sandwich arrived and I realized my wife and I had different toppings (but I hadn't order any of my toppings). Not the end of the world and my sandwich was okay. My son didn't like the pickles or beets and picked his out. It is just odd that when u publish toppings on the menu you don't ask what people want. Next time I will go to a smaller family owned shop and make sure I decide what is on my sandwich. Service. Poor overall service unless you are an UBER eats driver as they take care of those guys.
