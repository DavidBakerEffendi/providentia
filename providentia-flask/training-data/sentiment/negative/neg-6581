The first impression is not good, not good at all. We miss the old Island style burrito place that used to be here. 

We waited about 8-10 minutes to order and than well over 20 minutes for our food and it was not that busy. When we did receive our food it was not anything remotely special or difficult to put on a plate. Now if the food was amazing I could forgive the horribly long wait, but this food is just not that good at all. The street tacos my girlfriend ordered were just meat on a corn tortilla no cilantro... no nothing at all. The tortillas were cold as well. I ordered the Carne Asada Nachos. Wow, this establishments idea of nachos is chips just barely sprinkled with meat, cheese, tomatoes, and a little sour cream. All chips and no additional ingredients. 

I witnessed another gentleman leave after waiting just as long or longer than we did. Then it looked as if the owner or manager brought out the wrong order and had to take it back to the kitchen. Well this guy had enough and he decided this just wasn't for him. 

I am never too harsh and never allow myself to get too disappointed when it comes to trying something new, but Fun Taco is anything but fun and I am not sure if they have any idea what they are doing when it comes to the food or the service. This is the first time I have ever been so adamant on writing a review. Please do not waste your time or money at Fun Taco. 

Just stop down the street at Roberto's. At least you know what you are getting.

**UPDATE** I am pretty confident I just received what was meant to be an insulting response from the owner or an employee of Fun Taco's who goes by Jose M. Just another indication of the absolute disregard for the customer and their place of business as a whole. BEWARE OF FUN TACO'S!!!
