Not impressed! My husband and I like eating places we haven't been at. So we are from out of town. We see lumberjack and say let try it   It's someplace new. Yeah thanks no thanks! 
We walked in as a customer is trying to pay was complaining about his service and food ( that should of been the big clue) the person taking his money said oh let me get you waitress.  He left and after a few minutes a mother person came up ( not his waitress ) now take it we are still waiting to be seated. The man makes the same complaint and they take his money and send him on his way. 
Still standing waiting to be seated. You would think this place was packed, due to 4 wait personal on the floor and only 4 tables with customers we will be the 5th. So we get taken to a booth the waitress noticed no utensils and said she would be right back with utensils.  Nope! We looked at our menus for a while then our waitress come up and asked what we would like to drink. She left a few minutes later she is helping her other table ok, we get that. Then after that she comes back our drinks and says oh you have no utensils. She takes our order one of us orders the Tri Tip sandwich she stated to us it comes out medium rare so we said medium is ok. Well well done is more like it! This meal was total lack luster    The atmosphere was like we were bothersome not a paying customer. Would I ever go back No! My coffee tasted like it was from a burnt coffee pot
