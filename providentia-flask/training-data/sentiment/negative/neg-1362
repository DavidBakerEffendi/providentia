Around the time my pizza was suppose to be delivered I received a call stating they did not deliver to my complex and that I would have to come get my order. I got out to pick up my pizza only to get there and the manager tell me "someone canceled my order" and it was thrown out. This was my fist and last experience with Hungry Howie's.
