Absolutely the worst drive thru service ever in the morning. When the person came on the speaker she was extremely rude. We ordered and waited 25 minutes for the smoothies. Once we received them they were marked wrong and they tasted horrible, like they had no clue what went into which smoothie. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. 

We will never go back to that location ever again.
