I could not be more disappointed with the change over in the cafe. New chef in the cafe/diner has changed the menu and what used to be a hidden gem with solid portions and good variety is now boring and over priced. This place used to serve the most delicious chicken and waffles...not any more. 

The waitress even commented that the new chef has changed the whole menu and a lot of regulars has stopped coming due to their disappointment. I tried the "chicken and Pancakes" (which isn't even a thing) but whatever. The chicken was a small flattened breast piece with a panko batter and the three pancakes were small and bland. The advertised "jack Daniels maple syrup" was and off brand, peel-off lid syrup like you'd get  at a drive-thru fast food joint. The mini portion of fruit was small cubes of watermelon and cantaloup that would fit in the palm of your hand. 

The value isn't any better with the drinks either...$8.50 for a Bloody Mary that was blah at best. 

Time to find a new spot...
