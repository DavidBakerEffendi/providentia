I will never ever ever eat here again for as long as I live!!!!!!!   My brothers thought it'd be a good idea to take me here for dinner since I lived in AZ and there is no thai restaurants in my town.   They had been here before and said it was really good.  But OMG it was a big mistake.  about an hour after we ate here we just started vomiting and we got severe diarrhea that lasted for 3 straight days.  I mean it was non stop, so severe in fact that on the first night I slept on the bathroom floor next to the toilet.   I know it was this food that made us very ill....   This is why I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone, cuz I have nothing good to say about it.  Even our waitress was so rude that night.       "EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK."....   This place traumatized me so, that i'm afraid of going to eat thai food.   This place SUCKED!!!!!
