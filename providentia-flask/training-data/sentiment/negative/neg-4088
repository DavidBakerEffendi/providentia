Wanted to try this place.. Lady said "sorry can't come in right now" I asked, why? she said "very very busy.." I guess with 3 tables that was completely open was considered "busy".. No place to wait inside.. Other than outside.. I asked how long the wait is.. She said, "an hour! go outside... wait" 

Well thanks for being completely rude towards me and in front of your customers.. 

ill just go somewhere else..
