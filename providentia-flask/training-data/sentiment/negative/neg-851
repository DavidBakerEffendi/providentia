We really wanted to like this location after enjoying the Arcadia location.  After waiting 10 mins. for a seat on the patio, we were seated and served our water almost immediately. 

After 10 more mins., the server came by to get our drink orders; we wanted to give our app. order as well, but she didn't give us a chance. She left and chatted w/another table for at least 5 mins.  Then she went inside, came back to a diff. table and poured their wine/chatted for another few mins.  10 more mins. went by, we saw her inside getting beers for a diff. table, but never brought our iced teas...and the busperson had already filled up our waters AGAIN at this point. Totally ridiculous. 

After waiting 20 mins. total and ever getting our drinks, we left and let the hostess know that we were doing so. She apologized and we walked to Greene House for an excellent meal with a server who actually gave a rip about her customers/job.

We want to like Postino and their patio is awesome, food seems to be, too, but this left a sour taste in our mouths.
