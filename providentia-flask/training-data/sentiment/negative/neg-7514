We ate here yesterday for mothers day because the wait was too long everywhere else so we thought let's give this a try. That was a bad choice! I really wasted my money! They advertise fair food and hand dipped corn dogs however that was the worst corn dog I've ever had! It tasted like greasy pancake batter and not even close to a corn dog! Frozen grocery store much better. The brisket had zero flavor and the fried zucchini was a greasy much mess. We had to go out to our truck to get a drink because he never came with our refill and we left to use the restroom because it was disgusting! I wish I would have checked that first!
