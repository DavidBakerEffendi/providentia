My son and I decided to go to Saddle Ranch before a Coyotes game to grab some appetizers and a beer. After placing our order, the waitress came back and informed me that since there was a Coyotes game, they were not honoring their Happy Hour prices. You're kidding! Let's take advantage of the people coming to Westgate for a sporting event. There are too many choices in Westgate that DO honor Happy Hour to ever return to Saddle Ranch.
