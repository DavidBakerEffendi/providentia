This review is not based on anything other than service. Was out in Old Town on a Wednesday for some drinks with my boyfriend. I have lived in Phoenix for 17 years and also work at a bar in Old Town. Came here because the crowd was good and music and we were just bar hopping. Went up to an open space in the bar to get a couple drinks..had my credit card out and waited. From what I could see there were 2 girl bartenders that night and it was a pretty busy night for a Wednesday. I'm in the industry so I totally understand being busy and not getting to me right away...no big deal...but what I don't understand is the bartender making drinks for another person RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME ....looks RIGHT AT ME. I smile and wait since I figured she looked at me so she knows I'm waiting. But she does no sort of ackowkedging of me or "I'll be right with you" or "hey I'm so sorry I'm super slammed but I will be right back" Nothing. I understand if other people were before me and she needs to serve others before me...great...just let me know..all I got was a bartender with a shitty attitude and look on her face...I've worked in Old Town for years and KNOW how busy it gets especially in season...but I also know how to give good service and acknowledge people even when I am busy. If you can't handle it or don't like it..then don't work there. Little did she know I'm a great tipper but after being repeatedly ignored I didn't want her getting any of my money. I can't stand people in the industry that act like that and plus its just super unattractive women who act like that. However the bartender Jordan at Dakota was AMAZING. She was sooo sweet and nice and personable. Their music and vibe was great.
