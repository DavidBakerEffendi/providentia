I and my family really wanted this place to be awesome but sadly it wasn't.  Burger came out looking more like a meatball then a burger. The taste of the burger was mediocre. It could use some salt and pepper, trusts me a good seasoned burger goes a long way. The staff was nice. 

However we order some of their dipping sauce the (Cheese and creamy jalapeno) and our server forgot to bring them out to us with our food and I had to hunt him down to get them. The cheese sauce was cold and had little to no flavor as for the creamy jalapeno one it was just ok.  The only two things that night was the cardboard car that comes with the kid's meal and the fries and onion rings were pretty. I really hope this place gets better.
