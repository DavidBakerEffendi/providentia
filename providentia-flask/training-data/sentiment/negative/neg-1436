One word to sum this place up: YUCK!
My husband and I recently moved to Chandler and this place was referred to us by a friend.  When I first entered the place, I noticed the lack of ambiance.  The plastic tables and chairs did not help.  If you are new to Chino Bandido, they have you try several samples of their food, which was a nice touch on a so far lack-luster impression.  I decided on the Jade Red Chicken.  I was served my order but I wanted to wait for my husband to be served his before digging in.  We waited about 15 minutes and his order never came out so he went up to the counter to ask about it.  Apparently they forgot to put his order in.  By the time his order came out, mine was cold.  I took a bite from my chicken, and was confused so I inspected the piece further.  It was dark and did not taste like chicken. I tried a few more pieces and discovered the same thing.  I brought my order up to the counter and had the staff verify that it was chicken.  I'm still not convinced it was chicken.  To make the experience worse, I noticed one of the workers taking a few bites from a customer's order before bringing it out to them.  They were still chewing the food when they served the customer. Gross!
