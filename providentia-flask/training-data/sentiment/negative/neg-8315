Well I was hoping for something a little better but when you arrive here expect it to be dirty. Me sing the tables and chairs have precious diners left over crumbs. However the service is slow so maybe they leave those to tease you or for those impatient and so hangry, an lil snack before your actually take the plunge and order. Okay the atmosphere is country with blues. Cool seats with faux cow hide backs. I hope they are fake! There is a small stage for entertainment. I guess if you flight is delayed this could be great. We just missed the
Live music because guys was taking his black bag and leaving. The music they pipe thru heir system
Is loud if you don't want to talk to someone, come here
Check out the belt buckle walk. That's a nice distraction why waiting for your food which takes a while. Hopefully you won't be seated in the back by the whiskey barrel wallpaper because all you have to distract yourself with is people or free internet like me. Okay the menu is general American fare. We tried the chicken burger with bleu cheese crumbles. Ugh! The flavor on the chicken breast was too salty and not what I anticipated. the fries were okay. Overall, is it better than other airport food? No. I advise you to walk to different terminal and try something else. Not worth it
