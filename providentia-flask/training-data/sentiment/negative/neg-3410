After all the great press and awesome reviews ive heard I was looking forward to dining here.  My first thought was that the decor was urban shabby chic meets Goodwill garbage.  Sad but true!

My experience was absolutely disappointing and have no intention of trying it again. We were sat at a small uncomfortable table, with hard wobbly chairs.  Our server stopped by for drink orders however they were out of diet coke, because they only sell it in glass bottles, this was his explanation. Lame!   Once we ordered the pizza, we never saw our server make any other attempt to check on us. Our pizza was dropped off by another server,  and yet it was BURNT, looks and by taste. How do you bring this to the table! I posted a pic as well...This Pizza was tasteless, amd hardly any cheese yet the mushrooms were truly the only compliment i can give and the reason it deserves one star. I really don't understand the hype of this place.  I enjoy gourmet food but i assume alpo has more flavor then our pizza did.  Don't waste your time and money,  there's plenty of other tastey restaurants in that area to choose from.
