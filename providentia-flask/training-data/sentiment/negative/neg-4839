This place is a huge disappointment, the staff was rude and the food was over priced and mediocre. I got 2 pizza's and a shrimp scampi appetizer. I wasn't acknowledged for over 10 minutes after walking in to get my order.  People who walked in after me were served with no problem.  After asking if they could help me,  like a was a homeless person walking in from the street,  I informed them of my phone order.  30 minutes later I was walking out with my food.  Completely ridiculous! The dough on the pizza was soggy and the shrimp scampi consisted of 5 small shrimps in a bowl of melted butter for $12! That's over $2 a shrimp! The Taste on the shrimp was by far the most disgusting thing I've ever put into my mouth, I've had shrimp over a hundred different ways in over 20 different states, and somehow,  they managed to make the shrimp scampi taste like it was sauteed in pickle juice with lots of garlic. I recommend people spend their money somewhere else.  This place will leave you disappointed and wishing you listened to my review.
