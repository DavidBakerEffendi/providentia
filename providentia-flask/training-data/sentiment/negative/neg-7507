TERRIBLE, terrible service!!!!! I do not recommend any travelers to eat here. You can't ask a question about the menu, or anything for that matter, without being glared at.... The food isn't even that great (hence the photo of the weak and overly-priced half sandwich). The only thing they really have going for them is the mac 'n cheese. Again I do NOT recommend this place to travelers. I have not been so annoyed, irritated, and angry when leaving a food joint.
