We usually love this place. However, today, we waited well over an hour for our food. And that it's not counting the twenty minute wait to place or order. We watched three different couples sit next to us at the counter, eat and leave before our food even came up. When it finally did, my order was up but my husband's wasn't even started. The waitress tried to blame the kitchen staff, stating they are new and training, but we've been eating here for a long time and the cook has been there since the beginning. On top of this, my food wasn't cooked right. I've never had such poor service here. We ended up leaving and going across the street to Ihop. Hopefully, they can manage their time better.
