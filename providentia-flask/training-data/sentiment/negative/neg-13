The worst Chinese food I've ever had. Period. The wonton soup was bland and had a weird film on it, I guess "waxy" would be a good way to describe it. So sick. The craziest part tho was the general tso's chicken. Ok so we've all had this before right? So we're familiar with what it normally is... this general tso's chicken was *and I shit you not* those flat breaded chicken fingers that are normally on kids menus, floating in globs of that orange gelatinous duck sauce. Very bizarre. 
I called the restaurant after I got it to ask what was up with this, but I had ordered pretty late and they were already closed.
