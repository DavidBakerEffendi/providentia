I was driving by this place and thought I'd grab a burger on my way home. I'd never heard of it, but the name was appealing... don't think I'll ever be going back. 

I ordered a farm burger combo. After getting my food, I peaked in the bag quick and noticed the zuchinni sticks instead of fries. I said something to the girl in the window that I had asked for fries. Without any verbal response, she handed me a bag of fries and then walked away as I was trying to ask if she wanted the original bag with the zucchini back. Guess not...  Once I got home, I unwrapped my "burger" only to find it was a breakfast burrito. Super super disappointing. I feel like the girl at the window should have rechecked my entire order when she got part of it wrong. 

Since I was hungry, I tried the food they did give me, and I thought the zuchinni was tasteless and the burrito was pretty salty.  I actually did like the fries, but I'm still craving a burger...  like I said, i won't be going back or recommending this place to anybody else.
