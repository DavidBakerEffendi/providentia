15 minute wait for a to-go order for a single burger. The restaurant was empty, save 3 people. The only reason I got my burger at the 15 minute mark was because I had to approch the counter and ask what was going on. It seems the burger was ready and just sitting there in the bag for a while. It would be one thing if it was busy in there, but it was dead!

I had been alternating between this place and Habit Burger the past few weeks, but I think I'll just go to the Habit Burger on Blue Diamond in the future when I need a burger fix.

1 star.

No mas for me.
