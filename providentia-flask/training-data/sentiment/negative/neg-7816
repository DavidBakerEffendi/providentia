Never again.  Worst service, management and staff I've ever seen.  Arrogant snots running this place.  Fortunately for me, I can spread the world never to go tot his place again to a very large senior citizen community nearby.  You never tell someone your grill is not operational because you are cleaning it well after the order is placed, and you never blow off a customer waiting to be served at the deli counter when there are several workers standing right there.  I cannot emphasize how arrogant these idiots are.  But you know what, you are going to lose a ton of business now.  

The manager is a moron too.   He offered for us to come back, but no way. Service is and always has been a problem there, so he could care less because of the sheer volume of people that come through there.  Arrogance at its best.
