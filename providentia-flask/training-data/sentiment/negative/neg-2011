Yesterday a little before 4 pm my son and I walked into this Chipotle only to find it completely empty and when I say empty I also mean not a sole was behind the counter and not one person was in the restaurant eating. Not one person.  When someone finally walked over from the back room to make our food I noticed that both the brown rice and the vegetables had maybe an inch of food in the containers. Who knows how long that stuff sat there? I asked the server how long that stuff had been sitting there and he said he didn't know. because he just started his shift.  Let me tell you...the rice was crunchy and stale and now my kid is having a problem with his stomach. I will never go to this Chipotle again.
