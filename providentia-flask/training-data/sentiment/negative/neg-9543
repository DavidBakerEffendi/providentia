Well, we'll, well...i was served a "Parfait", that should hav been called a "Fruit Soup"....It was mushy n smushy n jus plain McNasty. Not only was it so old that it was only half of the cup's worth, but they actually had the AUDACITY to put a sticker on the bottom stating that it was good until 9 somethn that night! I called the manager number on the window, who was a man this time, who's info I'll be posting as soon as I find the picture I took of it. I will also post the sloppy, watered-down hot mess they claimed was a parfait as well. It's a shame n embarrassment the slippery-sloppery, sickenly disgusting prison like stuff this McDonalds tried to pass off to me as a parfait. The fact that the manager didn't bother to call me back after explaining the disgrace that took place at his restaurant jus goes to show u that this is not the best place to try n eat at, unless uve got a stomach of iron n can withstand a barrage of food poisoning on a regular basis....there jus aren't enough words in the English language to describe the pitiful porridge this place tried to serve me. 3 strikes n yer OUT! STAY AWAY! UVE BEEN WARNED.. VOMITING N DIARRHEA ARE NOT WORTH 30 MINUTES OF ALONE TIME WHILE THE KIDS PLAY IN THE PLAYLAND!
