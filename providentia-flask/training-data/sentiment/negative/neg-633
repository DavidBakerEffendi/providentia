We could use more healthy lunch options in Charlotte.  So I really wanted to like B.Good.  Perhaps it was what I ordered, but I'm unlikely to be back.  

I ordered the zucchini noodles with eggplant meatballs.  It was served in a paper bowl.  I could have eaten the paper bowl and been unable to taste the difference between the food and the paper.  Not much flavor, and the flavor that there was was simply not good.  They need to revamp their red sauce.  It sucks.  

Twenty minutes after eating this way overpriced and sub-par lunch, I was firing kale out of my ass at warp speed.  Dear God!!! I nearly achieved lift off!  After 6, yes SIX, trips to the kamode, I finally ran out of anal ammo.  I may have to work this weekend given how much time I spent on the shitter during business hours yesterday.  

I guess the upshot is that if you are trying to lose weight, this is the place to go.  Definitely a net loss of calories as the food ran through me in 20 minutes, and then continual muscles spasms and anal eruptions definitely resulted in net caloric burn.  I'd rather get on the treadmill for caloric burn. Speaking of burn, my brown eye is rubbed raw from yesterday's B.Good adventure.  I am not enjoying that.  Not at all.
