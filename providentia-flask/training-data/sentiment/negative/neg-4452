BLECH-itude.  From the second we pulled into the older strip mall where this resto is located, I had a feeling I wasn't going to like it. The feeling continued when I walked in and got the distinct smell of recent cigarette smoking (perhaps from within the kitchen?) No matter, I thought to myself - the banh mi will be worth it.  I was (sniff sniff) wrong.  Though the bread was warm, it didn't have the flakiness that I've come to enjoy with good banh mi, and the filling to bread ratio was sadly lacking.  The daikon/carrot mix inside the 'wich overpowered all of its other flavors... so much so that I kept adding chili sambal paste to make this meal go down easier.  Even my banh mi companion (she believes herself to be an expert) admitted that the food was below sub-par. Add to that the overall inattentiveness of the staff, and well... SIGH. Too bad.  I really wanted to like this place after reading some of the rave reviews but, after my experience, don't think I'll be returning.  Only highlight: the low prices -- $3 for a 'wich ain't bad.... but the old adage, "You get what you pay for...." seems to ring true here.
