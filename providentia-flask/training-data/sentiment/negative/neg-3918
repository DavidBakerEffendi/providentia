Here right now at this location. And Victor the server is working. First we waited almost 10 minutes for someone to come out. Then when he did, he came out irritated. Took our order and being rude. Have him the menu back and he snatches it from my hand.. made us feel as if we were unwanted.... what a jerk.. definitely not coming back to this location and possibly company...
