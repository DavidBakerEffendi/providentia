Would have given them 0 stars but my fianc√© ordered gizzards and a gyro, which he said were very good. His chicken wings...not so much. And I ordered their white pizza that comes with an olive oil sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, and parm. I added spinach, tomatoes and garlic. Asked them to leave off the ricotta but add feta instead, which they did. Pizza arrived burned on the edges and VERY DRY. And there was no garlic because it would have added flavor to this otherwise bland and cardboard pie. I called the restaurant and told them I was not happy with what was delivered and could they please try again. That request was met with an absolutely not response!! She said they sent me what I asked for, the pizza was not burned, and they would not replace the pie. And with that, she hung up on me!! Would not recommend this establishment to anyone who expects something edible to be delivered. And it wasn't cheap!!
