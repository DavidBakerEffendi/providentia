Whoa I was mislead by the four star rating.  The beer lines in the place need a thorough cleaning, as mold was very noticeable in my pints.

My Thai pizza (a digiorno frozen pizza) was very bad.  My wife's soggy fries and frozen breaded chicken breast was equally as bad.  Nachos, to say the least, were nuked in the microwave.  Don't make the same mistake we did.
