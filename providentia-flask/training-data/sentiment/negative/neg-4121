I was looking forward to checking out this new restaurant. Ordered 4 burgers and 2 poutines. When the food arrived, the poutines were missing. The staff began arguing that it was not ordered and why I was even overcharged for what I got. Left feeling very frustrated. 
And the burgers were not good at all. Sorry.
