Terrible business.

I showed up at lunch time and they didn't have any roast beef, so I couldn't order the sandwich that I wanted.

I also had to correct them multiple times from making the wrong sandwich to toasting my sandwiches when I didn't want them toasted.

Every Subway experience I have had within the last few months has been shockingly awful.  The standards and employee expectations at these establishments are so far below the national average that it is almost laughable how bad the customer service has become.
