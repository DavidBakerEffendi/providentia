This is the worst experience I ever had in Vegas .
I met a friend for a lunch today. We were rushed to our lunch. The server wanted to take my plate while was eating. As I was talking to my friend. A guy came up to us and asked why we are still sitting and scared my friend. We felt uncomfortable and we had to leave. I will never go to this place ever again . Don't recommend
