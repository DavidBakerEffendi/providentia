BEWARE. There is a crooked server working here who will steal your credit card information! I had a fraudulent charge for $275.00 at an online retail website placed on my checking account shortly after eating here on Sunday morning, 5/20/2018. I called the restaurant and talked with a manager who "assured me that this didn't happen here." That shows you just how concerned they are about ripping off their customers. In fact, it may have been the manager I was speaking with who made the charge. It's too bad because the food and service here is normally very good, but if you can't trust them with your method of payment... well.
