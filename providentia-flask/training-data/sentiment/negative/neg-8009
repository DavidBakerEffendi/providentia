Was hoping for the time of my life... ended up being a waste of time.  

Took my girlfriend here for a nice fun Friday night out and found out this place is a joke of a restaurant.  I am only giving Tandoori Times 1 star because the belly dancer was entertaining and Yelp won't allow me to give it zero stars.

The Naan was extremely burnt and was so hard it would make a better Frisbee than any type of nourishment.  The chicken tika masala was the worst I've ever encountered and I didn't even bag the leftover chicken to feed my dog.  The service was slightly better than the food but with such low standards that's not saying much.  I don't think I would even consider coming back if the owner paid me to.
