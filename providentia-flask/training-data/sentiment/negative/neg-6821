Showed up after the football game, it's 6:00pm and they took forever to serve us drinks (actually never came before we decided to leave), wanted a salad with no onions but that was a modification they wouldn't allow during a post-game rush, and the kicker... OUT OF BAKED POTATOES at a steak house! Nothing about this place justifies the pricing except having the steak house aspect cornered in this Westgate Entertainment area. My advice if you're here during the NFL season, skip this place and go elsewhere since there is so much to choose from!
