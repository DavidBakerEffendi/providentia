The food choices weren't the best and the food itself was cold. My husband got the prime rib and it was hard and cold. I would have to say it was really disappointing but since we are staying here at the mirage we wanted to try the buffet. Compared to Cesar's or even the buffet at the stratosphere I wouldn't pay this price again. I've never been so disappointed at a buffet and seeing how big it was I was positive it would be a good one. Boy I was wrong.
