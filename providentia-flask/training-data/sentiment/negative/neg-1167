A typical dim sum place. Brought my grandma here for dim sum on Sunday. I don't mind waiting cause it was expected but there's no seats for the elderly when people are waiting. Dim sum is norm for most older Asians for breakfast brunch and lunch. The staff is quite rude also.. will consider other dimsum places since the wait is the same.

Update****

We waited for 45mins apparently they give seats to ppl they know. Even though you got a number it means nothing.
