After roaming the streets for breaky I finally fell upon Aroma Espresso Bar on Queen. It was some what busy with people.

I ordered the French Toast. When I came I retrieved it from the bar and returned back to my seat. First I noticed that my "syrup" was a little cloudy so I open the serving portion to discover that it was actually salad dressing. Whatever, I work in the industry, it happens. Easy switcheroo.
Next I picked up my fork and noticed a stain on it. Whatever, so it's a little spotty. Rub rub, wait, that's dried on egg. Gross! Fine so they missed one. Switched for a clean one.
So the French Toast wasn't bad. Not great but not bad. Served with a side of fresh fruit and home made whipped cream. After getting through two pieces of FT I was about to dive into my fruit when I notice something on a grape. Yup, it was mold.

Three strikes, I'm out! See Ya never!
