The worst buffet I've had. We had to wait like half an hour before getting seated. Even the group that came after us got seated first. The quality of food and the selection was very poor. Everything tasted off. Even some cheap food court Chinese food woulda tasted better. I just didn't like anything about it. And I believe its super expensive for bad food. It cost around $25 pp after taxes for dinner on a weekend. Blah
