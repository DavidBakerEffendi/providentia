Little Coxwell. I just found out why they are pho.is richer in color and a little bit thicker but not clear at all. Knor swiss now  makes pho powder as in instant fall in that great big yellow can tell it's all base is no natural ingredients in it that's where I couldn't finish it the other day. It's all chemicals. When I was eating it I could tell. But just to make sure I look in the kitchen and saw a great big can of Instant Knor swiss pho mix. That's just plain laziness and a product is not good
