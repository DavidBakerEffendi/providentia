This is a complete rip off. It's about $70.00 per person. If you are in a group of 7 or more expect to spend at least $90.00 each person after gratuity.  Yes, there's 6 courses, however, each course is small and bland. It's a mystery  menu, all plant based food. The food was so disappointing, I don't even know where to begin. Honestly,  if the cost was only like $40.00 per person maybe I wouldn't be so upset. I can't help but feel cheated. Good service, unique experience,  but the whole point is to have your sense of taste and smell heightened. Well, mine was, and I was painfully aware of the lack of flavor and originality of each dish.
