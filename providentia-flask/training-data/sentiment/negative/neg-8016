An absolute train wreck. After watching my buddy completely finish his meal I then started to question where mine was. When I was told the chef was working on it, I knew it was time to pick up and leave. I honestly do not get how restaurants can still survive in an age where people like me can immediately pick up their phones and place a review, negative or positive, in an instant.
