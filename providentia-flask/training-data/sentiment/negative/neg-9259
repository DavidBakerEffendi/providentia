I went to this Wild Wings locations with my cousin one night to watch the UFC fights.

I normally would not go to a chain restaurant but I went to accompany my cousin, we ordered some food then some dessert. I tried to order coffee but it turns out that Wild Wings does not serve any coffee, the staff gave me all kinds for BS excuses as to why they do not sell coffee!
I was a little shocked at the fact they don't serve coffee! Needless to say it is things like that why I don't go to chain type restaurants.
