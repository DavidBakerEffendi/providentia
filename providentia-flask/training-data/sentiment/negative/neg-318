Slow service on a Tuesday night. Food was slow. Truffle fries came with tiny pieces of fries and cold, gravy ordered on the side developed a thin film within minutes of getting it, tuna sliders was inedible, burger was burnt, waitress was not knowledgable and slow. And...washroom ran out of paper towels. We will never return after this horrible experience.
