YUK YUK BARF-A-QUE
 
It was dinner time and we had a choice, Yum Yum BBQ or El Polo Loco. Hmmm where should we eat?  I figured Yum Yum would be the best pick of the two because it wasn't fast food. 

Standing at the counter there is no menu above but a picture of large cartoon characters. A small menu was located to the left that is so low that you have to bend over to read it.  So I stood up and ordered. Our food comes out (BBQ mix plate and Chicken Katsu). I should let you know this place is pretty much like a wanna be L&L BBQ. So, I would think that the portions would be close to an L&L mix plate for the same price of $8.99........... Noooooope. I also didn't think I would spend $20 for two plates.

The food was bland, over cooked, took way to long (maybe the reason it was over cooked?) and the portion size was an insult to my hard earned $8.99. I don't want to say all bad stuff....... The older lady was nice.

Ok, so the lesson of the story is that if you want Hawaiian BBQ or someones spin on it you should just stick to the big hitters. I'm not sure how in a city of a million restaurants this place stays in business. 

Never again....
