ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE!

My husband and I came on 3/25 for a early dinner. It was our first time and excited to give it a try

About 10 minutes after leaving we both became violently ill. Turns out we both had food poisoning. 

Not sure which dish is the culprit. I had the Pho Special, my husband had the Bun Bo Hue. Together we shared: grilled pork rolls, Banh Xeo, and a Thai iced tea. 

It was completely empty when we went at 4 pm. 

Will not be back.
