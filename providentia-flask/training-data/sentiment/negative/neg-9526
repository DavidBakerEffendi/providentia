I've tryed over and over again when hunger strikes and theres nothing else to give these guys a chance in the hopes for decent mexican meal but I get nothing except embarrassment that they call this food. It is an insult to food everywhere. 

I ordered a beef chimichanga ...at first it looked great and tasty! It was this huge masive tortilla and it smelled great! 

But then the first bite came and wow, I could have spit it out but I couldnt.

The beef was obviously sitting in a mushed pile of old stock and vegetables on the warmer for several hours.
The tomatoes were flavorless still green disgusting cheap product. The beans.......omg, really?  How the hell do you ruin beans!!!  They were tasteles and runny! 

I tried to eat it in the hopes that at least one bite would taste good but that never happened. At every bite I only kept thinking that I wasted 6 dollars ! 

I feel sorry for those who give Roberto's a high rating because they have never had good mexican food to realize the kind of junk that they serve.
I would have rather had a chalupa at taco bell...

What a shame.
