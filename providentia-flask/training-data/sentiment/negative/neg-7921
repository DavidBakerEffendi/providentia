SushiSamba is trying to be something it's clearly not:  a restaurant you could return every night if you had only 2 nights in Las Vegas. 

Sushi:  average, very average.   That's it.   Nothing to add other than the excessive price.   My wife and I do not mind high prices in Las Vegas.   We ordered 3 rolls which did not deliver the promise of every ingredient working together.   The chef made each roll so thin that some ingredients did not even announce their presence.  Portion control - gone too far? 

Some dishes looked promising but we tried only sushi.
