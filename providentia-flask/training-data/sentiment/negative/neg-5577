Got seated right away, dining alone while traveling for work. I don't have high expectations for airport restaurants, but expect it to be the typical experience. I waited 10 minutes for a waiter to approach me. He did and took my drink order. Showed back up to take my food order. I asked for a Cobb salad with ranch. Response was that they didn't have salads or sandwiches. Bewildered, I asked why. "Our kitchen staff." Told me I could order quesadillas or burgers. Some entrees, mashed potatoes. One would have thought to mention that to me when he took my drink order! I order my second choice of a quesadilla. It shows up, with barely any filling, which consists of a few pieces of corn, scattered black beans, tons of onions, mushrooms and scant cheese. I stopped the waiter and asked where the chicken was, as it said grilled chicken quesadilla on menu. Response? "You didn't ask for it. Don't think we have it anyway." Usually if something comes with a choice of filling the person taking the order will prompt the customer. I pointed out the random french fry I found in it. Waiter could care less. Laughed it off and walked away without offering to take it back and fix it. No manager on duty it seems. I will never come back here.
