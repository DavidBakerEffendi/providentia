WORST Pizza Hut I have EVER been to in my entire life. Due to being in a small area I am forced to use the Pizza Hut on Pizza Hut 4048 Beechwood Blvd, Pittsburgh, PA  15217, United States. I have never had the most disrespectful, inconsiderate, & inconsistent Pizza Hut in my life. Management is even worse than the other employees. Every time I order something is incorrect, my pizza took forever to be delivered and wasn't here at the time I was quoted, & all the employees are rude. They act as if I should be lucky as to have them prepare my food. Whenever I complain, management just says "you can contact corporate if you would like". When I called to see why it took an hour for my pizza to be delivered I was told they were on their way and couldn't tell me how long it would take. I only live 3 mins away, by the way.  They still showed up 20 mins later. This is not how my service should be at all. From now on, I'm just going to buy from dominoes.
