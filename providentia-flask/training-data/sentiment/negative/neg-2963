Went there early morning with few other families. Five minutes after being seated waitress came by and informed us that they cannot serve pancakes since the cabinet they keep pancake mix is locked by manager who is not on shift. We started looking at other options and asked her about few other items and answer was no to french toast and few other items. So it turns out 90% of things we wanted to order were locked by manager. As we decided to leave another waiter (who was saw standing outside texting) came by and told us not to go to ihop since they have long wait times. We called ihop and they did not have any wait time. At IHOP we were treated nicely and fresh pancakes, crepes, hash browns and eggs were served without much wait. I do not think I be coming back to Denny's since we had called ahead the night before informing we would be coming early morning. But instead of quality service we got "things are locked by manager" and do not go to IHOP as sales pitch. They need to work on customer service and be more professional.
