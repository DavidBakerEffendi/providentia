We got wings and dessert here last night, we ate the dessert first and it was okay, nothing amazing but not bad.
Then we eat most of our wings (we were in our room with the lights off and only the tv on) and they didn't taste that great so I turn on the lights to clean up and to my surprise the wings were undercooked! Still pink !!!!! I immediately call (after throwing up) for a refund and I was asked to take pics and text the pictures to them, wish they would have refunded the entire order for the inconvenience  but at least we got the wing money back. Terrible.

Ps- I stand corrected, I ATE TWO WINGS WHILE MY COMPANY ATE SOME OF THE OTHERS*
