4 adults and a toddler all went to the Texas roadhouse on August 6 at 5 pm. We had called ahead to help save time and requested a certain server also. On arrival we were told it would be about a 20 minute wait, since we requested Nick to wait on us. 41 minutes and they seated us. But it was not in Nicks section. Host staff did not care and said it would be another 40 minutes if we wanted Nick as a server.
We stayed with out having Nick wait on us.

When our food arrived, kids meal was burned to a crisp and it was delivered last(should have been first). I was missing the mushroom and onion toppings, my wife's meal was missing the tartar sauce and no butter for the sweet potatoes(potatoes was cold by the time it arrived) and Teresa's steak was overcooked and dry.

4 out of 5 meals were done wrong! 

I rarely complain about a place, but this was very bad. They were only open for 2 weeks, but this was like it was the 1st night blues. The cooks and hostess staff were the main issues. No manager came by either.

I should state that Jolene was our server and that she did an excellent job waiting on us.

The kids meal should have been taken off our bill as it was not edible.

We won't go back to this restaurant again.
