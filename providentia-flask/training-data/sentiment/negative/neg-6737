Food was cold and they took 20 minutes to make. I ordered a burrito which was priced at 5.65. After tax i checked my statement and they charged my card 10$! I guess the workers think they can add their own personal tips. Very dishonest workers. Pay cash and double check what they are charging you if you are going to come here. PS Not sure what i just ate but looked like a fingernail and pubes. I did not know they had pubes and fingernails on menu. Maybe that's why they over charged me??
