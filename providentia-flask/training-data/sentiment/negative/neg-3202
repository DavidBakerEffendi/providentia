Terrible atmosphere. Not only do you have to eat your food with your hands it's an extremely uncomfortable environment in pitch black the food is sub par with very fishy fish and low-end beef. You can't complain or say anything since your dining in the dark but the food tastes horrendous. The prices are extremely high for the quality of food and service you are receiving. Would never recommend this place
