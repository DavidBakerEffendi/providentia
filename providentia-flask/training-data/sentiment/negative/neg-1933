Went back the other day after hearing people say that they have improved in their ramen flavors. I'm sorry to say but you can not call that improvement...we had the fire and ice and the tonkotu and same thing as I reviewed before. Tonkotu is so salty but yet NO flavor. (How does this happen?!) and fire and ice is just blah.
I really truly don't understand the raving reviews of this place... These people must have never had real ramen before...sorry to say but it's by far the worst ramen I've ever had. I'd much rather eat instant ramen at home then eating this.
