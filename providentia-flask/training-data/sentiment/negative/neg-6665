The food is ok but the people who work at the restaurant are very rude, last time we ordered 3 dinners and a large soup, I found piece of metal in my soup and when I return to
The restaurant and explained the lady at the front counter she start negotiating with me how much will refund back which I really didn't care about the money but she was very rude. Just watch what eat their.
