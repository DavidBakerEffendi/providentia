Just horrible. Literally within the 1st 30 minutes they had 4 people walk out. All in the section we were in to. Michelle was our server, she was nice. But i feel the resturant was ran ridiculous. They were very shirt staffed it looked like and Michelle looked like she was doing a little of everything amd way more then she was suppose too while a bunch of the other workers just stood around and talked and bullshitted which caused the wait time to be so long just to get asked what we wanted to drink. One guy in particular who had this little Nicky hair cut I couldnt read his name but all he did was talk to this busser and lounge around. I also noticed the older busser guy had left the bin of dishes from the table he cleaned on the table and when the little Nicky hair cut guy went and pit these people at the table all he did was move the bin. Didnt bother wioing the table down after. Discusting. This place was unorganized. Wont be coming back.
