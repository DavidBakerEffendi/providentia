My review of this place is simple. The concept of how they make the food and the novelty of eating with your hands has an appeal that is quite limited. We went in here thinking it was going to be a nice seafood restaurant. When we sat down we thought the plastic bibs and the cheap disposable gloves were a bit odd. When we went to order we found out the sizzling plates are only available until 4pm after that it is just bags of seafood that they plop on your paper covered table. 

The service was abysmal as they needed to be prompted several times to give us water and then never refilled our glasses. They kept delivering the wrong food to our table. 

The concept of digging food out of plastic bags just didn't sit well with me. Perhaps if those bags had been in buckets or even better if the food had been in buckets it would have gone over better. The sauce was laced with garlic and even their mild was too hot for my daughter

This was our one and only time we will ever go there.
