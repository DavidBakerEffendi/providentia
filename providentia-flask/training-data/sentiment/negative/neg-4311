This review is for happy hour only.

Very limited menu (was also informed by the slightly unpleasant waiter).  Three kinds of beer, one white and one red, and maybe a few cocktails.  I ordered half dozen oysters, a few mussels, a seafood something, spicy tuna cut roll, and a california cut roll.  The bill, $60.  what?  That is for one person.  They charge $3 for oysters for happy hour and no Kumamoto's.  another what?
