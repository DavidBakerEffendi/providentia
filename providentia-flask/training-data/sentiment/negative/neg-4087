I'm not sure why, but every time I hang out with business students I end up going somewhere that reminds me of a frat house. Between this place and "The Maddy" (http://www.yelp.com/biz/madison-avenue-pub-and-restaurant-toronto), I just get the sleazy feel of desperation that is college guys trying to hit it and quit it. There's a reason why I stopped going to frats after my first few months of university. 

And if it weren't enough, you need to pay to get into this sweaty, crowded, obnoxiously loud imitation frat house. Whatever happen to the good old days when you just had to pull your dress a little shorter or your top a little lower? If I don't want to get into a frat for free, why the hell would I want to pay to get into a fake frat?

The cherry on top is the sprinkling of creepy old guys who are sulking on the sides, drinking beers and watching college girls get rowdy. Play on, players.
