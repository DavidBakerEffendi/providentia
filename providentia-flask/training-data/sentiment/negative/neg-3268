Wowww what a huge disappointment. I think anybody who have no idea about how Indian food should taste like will give this place a 5 star rating. If I can I would give this place -100 rating but unfortunately that's not possible. The hostess was nice and friendly but the food was disgusting I am not even going to say bad it was disgusting. Never every going back
