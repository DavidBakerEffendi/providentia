Went here for breakfast yesterday, which was Labor Day. Sat at the bar, on the patio side. The guy behind the bar said he was new and apologized in advance for his not being familiar with the bar. Wasn't a problem at all. What was a problem was the old lady wearing a mumu working behind the bar. From previous trips, I assume she is one of the owners. She was a horrible representation of the restaurant. Dressed like she just rolled out of bed, you could tell she had dark underwear on since her clothing was super thin. At least get hair and makeup were done. But this is the worst part. On several occasions, I saw her wipe her forehead with her hands, and then serve drinks. WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS. Then, she collected trash, pushed it down in the bag, and went back to serving customers. Again, WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS. I really hope this gets read by ownership/management, because there is no place for people like this in an industry where appearance and cleanliness are so important. And if she is indeed an owner, she should be ashamed and embarrassed. Have some class and give your employees the proper training and support so you don't have to be hands on in that capacity ever again.
