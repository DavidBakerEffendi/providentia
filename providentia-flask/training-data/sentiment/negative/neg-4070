Very dissapointed with our overall experience...don't even know where to start. We had reservtions at 10 and wasn't seated till 10:30. We ordered pretty quickly since we were all so hungry BUT waited 1 hour to get our food. We were 8 hungry women getting a lil' impatient
and irritated, as you can imagine. The manager, Kat, did come out to apologize for the long wait and said she'd take care of it on the back end. The waiter came back out and told us that the manager would escort us to the club for a free entrance to compensate for their poor service. It was a nice gesture, but very weak, we thought. We are all girls and can get into any club for free in Vegas. Anyway, our food came out and was good, but nothing amazing worth over 3 stars. My filet mignon was burnt on the outside and it sure didn't melt in my mouth like I would expect at any other 4 star restaurant. My girlfriend who was pregnant specifically told our waiter and asked for her meat to be cooked well done, but came out pink in the middle anyawu. I can probably go on and on... The worse part was when we asked to talk to the manager at the end of our meal, it took her a good 15 minutes to come. I would think if you already knew customers were having issues, she would be there quickly. Not here. Despite all that, she did take a portion off our bill, but the fact that she had an attitude and was not apologetic at all, still left a bad taste in our mouths. It's unfortuante that we came to this restaurant expecting a 4 star experience but left unhappy, unsatisfied and irritated. Will never come back nor recommend this place to anyone even if it was free. I don't care how good the food is. If the service sucks, it's not worth it, in my opinion. Sorry.
