Not a fan of this place and probably won't be coming back, which I am completely fine with.  Came in right away and sat at the bar, asked for a whiskey list hence the name of the establishment and none were to be found.  We had to move around to the other side of the bar just to see what they had and even then we couldn't.  For Whiskey being in the name they have a horrible selection to choose from.

Felt like our server didn't want to serve us or help us at all.  The way the bar is setup is nice but to get the attention of someone you have to yell or walk around to find them since you cant see through.

Just overall had a bad experience and I hate writing reviews with one star but had no choice with this one.
