wenr last week for the montreal tbl citywide food festival. Well you'd think that they would put they're best foot forward. The service was teriible. I waited a good 10 minutes before anyone came to the table . another 10 mins for bread and water . The waiter throughout the whole meal was standing in the hostess vestibule basically ignoring his whole section. The food was just so so. based on the food alone i WOULDNT return but this combined with the bad service you can forget it!
