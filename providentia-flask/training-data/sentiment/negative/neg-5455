My husband went here tonight to pick up dinner. Not only did he wait forever, the dumb dumb running the register charged his card for $275 instead of $27.50. Za's is on the decline between changing their menu, upping their prices and hiring idiots that essentially don't have to even speak to people considering you give them paper menus. What could be so hard... and people want $15 minimum wage.
