I thought maybe this was a hidden gem, not at all! Food was okay, space is very dank, service was horrible! My dinner counterpart did not like her meal, the waitress' response: Sorry. After asking the item to be removed from the bill the waitress and owner literally argued with us since she had taken a few bites (how else can you tell you do/don't like something). A few days later, I'm noticing they ran my debit card twice. NEVER AGAIN!
