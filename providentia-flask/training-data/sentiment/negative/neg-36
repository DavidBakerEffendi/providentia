Really just a cheap crappy burger joint with nothing special. They have a ton of options but nothing worth getting.  

Burger had no flavor, was dry and covered in condiments to try and hide it. Chicken nuggets looked like they were the kind you buy in Costco and throw in the oven for your 12 year old's playdate. Onion rings were fake. Not real onion rings but the kind that are made of formed mashed onions, so they just taste like onion flavored mushy breading.  

I don't think I've ever had a more complete waste of money at a restaurant before.
