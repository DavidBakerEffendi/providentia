I am sad to say that the Winking Lizard has completely gone down hill the last few years, and after many years of going there, I probably won't go back. Went there for a birthday party with about 15 friends, and to watch the Browns game. In the 3 hours I was there it took anywhere from 15 minutes to a half hour to get a beer, and we were sitting at the bar!! Very few people in there, so this made no sense. Almost walked out without paying as we could not even get our checks! Terrible service, just terrible.
