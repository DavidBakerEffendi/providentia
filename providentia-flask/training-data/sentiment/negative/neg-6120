Inconsistent food. They touch the food with hands and no gloves. Food has dropped out of the window onto surfaces and placed before me. Tables are not wiped. Team motto "make them wait, make them pay and make them say thank you." Manager was not present. Awful experiences. Never recommending to anyone.
