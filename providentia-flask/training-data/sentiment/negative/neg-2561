Food's good but the waiters are way too laid back and even impolite at times.

One waiter is looking insistently at my girlfriend. Not that I am jealous or that I lack confidence but they shall know when to behave like they are in a bar and when to behave like they are at work. I went twice there and the same waiter was intensively checking out female customers every time.

The other waiter wouldn't take my order properly as he was standing very far from me when taking notes (like I was apparently supposed to shout at him to say what I wanted). He did dare arguing with me that I shall have said something as soon as I noticed that he wasn't proposing me the proper sauces accompanying my meal...

It's the french school of waiting, where being impolite is accepted. The difference is that, in France, tipping 15% of the bill is not the norm. I'm waiting for much more coming from a supposedly chic establishment (at last when one looks at the prices).

Montreal does not lack of good restaurants with servers providing great service. I'm definitely not going back to Lemeac before a long time.
