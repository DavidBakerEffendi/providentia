Not authentic.  We ate there for lunch.
 They gave us the lunch menu.  We ordered #1 (pad Thai), #11 & 16.  Three diff types of foods and they were horrible. one taste fishy which we barely touched, pad Thai taste like ketchup but my kids ate it because it's sweet, and another we barely touched.  The waitress was very nice and for her to see 1253 Buck Jones Rd, Raleigh, NC 27606that the food was barely touched should have given us a discount at least. what a waste of food and money.  Clean restaurant but we just had a bad experience
