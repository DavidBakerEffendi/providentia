Rebecca was the absolute worst waitress. No personality no smile and took about 12 min just for a water to hit the table another 10 or so to get refills. The food runner ran out pop tart that they offer and had a nasty bandaid on his finger. We had no silverware to eat our food so the table next to us gave us theirs. Rebecca didn't check back once we got out food and my French toast was raw. So I had to walk back to host stand to get a Manager. John (Manager) was nice. Got a new item- pulled pork. Frys were super stale and my guests ordered garlic frys and didn't get the right ones. Terrible service and then brought us the check with all items on it. Including my French toast and new item to replace that so then had to get the check corrected and they tried to "make it all better" by sending dessert... it didn't work guys. One waitress to another Rebecca was not personable or attentive at all. We are locals and WILL NOT be back.

To top it off- she brought the bill back with not only the "free" dessert on it, but it had 3 additional items we did not order on it. So I left the correct total cash and left. Worst service I've received in a very long time.
