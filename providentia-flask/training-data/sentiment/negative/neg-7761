Trendy restaurant with a great atmosphere and beautiful food, however rather boring and overpriced.

We were here to celebrate a birthday on a Friday evening- the location is ideal for an intimate celebration since the restaurant is small yet there are long booths along the wall that can accompany a group.

We had a sampling of the fried calamari, secreto iberico (pork) dish and Fideu√° de bacalao (noodles/fish).

The appetizer of the calamari was the highlight of the evening, delicious and fresh, it could not be matched to our main meals. The pork was good, but priced at 40$ and served with tiny cherry tomatoes, it looked disappointing. For such a simple and cheap type of meat, I can't imagine what was so special about the pork, it didn't even melt in my mouth.

My Fideua was also kind of joke, it looked like asian rice noodles simmered in leftover fishy broth with a small piece of cod in the middle. The whole thing was fishy and boring. I expected something more unique, I couldn't believe this dish was "spanish" and the value certainly wasn't there either.

We have been to so many other places that serve better, more tender meat and I've have better rice noodles at home, so walking out of there with a bill that was over 100$ (we didn't even get drinks or dessert) I felt ripped off. A popular chef behind the name and a beautiful decor don't justify the food unfortunately.
