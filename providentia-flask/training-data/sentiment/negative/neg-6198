The food is good so I've continued to come back despite the terrible service, however.. I think I've reached my breaking point now.
Went for lunch. There were 5 people in the restaurant at most and my party of 3 were the only ones not sitting at the bar. Still waited 15 min for the waitress to take our order after having to ask multiple times to place an order because the was busy.. with what.. I don't know, seeing as the place was empty. 
Check came out wrong but paid it anyway since I was on my lunch break and had already been there way too long. 
Overall. I won't be going back. There's been too many instances of the same behavior with different waitresses either not caring or not knowing what they're doing.
