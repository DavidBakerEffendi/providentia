Every person working had a scowl.  Took 27 minutes for our server to take our orders. I actually waved to one of the other servers to get her attention and she ignored me. Lighting is bad - bright beaming spotlight over the tables which was sticky along with the menu. And to add to the ambiance, there was a distinct burning smell coming from the kitchen. Food just ok, nothing that will make me want to return.
