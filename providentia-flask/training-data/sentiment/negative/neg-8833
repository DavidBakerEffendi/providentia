I came here for a breakfast burrito which I heard was very good. ordered it and took about 28 mins to get my food. Excited to finally eat i dove in. the burrito was very cold as if it sat for the whole time I waited. I asked to speak to a manager. let the mgt know about my situation the long wait and the cold food. She was only willing to give me 10% off my meal. I wasnt there for a discount just wanted a hot meal and was very frustrated after waiting 28 mins to get it. this is not how to treat customers. I am very let down by this place and will not be coming back.
