Four of us dined here for the second time on Sunday.  The food was excellent....however, this was our second time experiencing poor service, which we thought was an aberration on our first visit!  All wait staff are exceedingly rude to the point of exasperation!  They are not attentive and act as though they are enduring you!  We had to ask for hot tea repeatedly; after entrees arrived (with a time gap 
between each) we had to ask repeatedly for the accompanying rice. Insult ended our experience...when presented with the bill we were asked by two wait staffers to vacate our table...even though no one was waiting for a table and several tables were vacant.  We will definitely NEVER return to this venue!
