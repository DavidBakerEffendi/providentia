Was there for dinner last night and had quite an awful experience.
The night started off fantastically, had great drinks and the waitress was very helpful in recommending food. Food, was delicious. Fantastic really, esp the Loosey and the cheesesteak. The music was crazy loud and we asked to have it turned down a titch, no luck, but not that big of a deal. 

The problem started after we settled our tab, 120.00 bucks no less, when we were rudely asked if we could move to the bar to finish our drinks. I had a quarter of a beer left...... really?, we couldn't just finish our drinks at the table we had dinner at? So we comply, and move all our stuff, jackets etc, to the bar.....And the bar seats she wanted to give us still had crap on them, no accommodation made what-so-ever for us moving. It was like we were inconveniencing them more by moving, even though they made us.
Then.... To make matters worse, ten minutes into sitting at the bar,  we were told if we weren't going to order more food or drinks we had to leave to let others sit down. We turn around, no one was waiting in line. They were literally trying to throw us out, twice, at the end of our meal! Basically: we got your money, so now you can piss off, cause we don't give a crap that you are enjoying a conversation and a cocktail. Absolutely brutal. Tainted the whole meal and the fact that the food was pretty good. Can't believe the rudeness of a business trying to make it in the service industry. Incredible.
