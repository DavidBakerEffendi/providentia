This restaurant made me download Yelp. As soon as we walked in the chefs were sitting down eyeballing us ,holding onto their vapes. We get to our seats and the waiter just stands there without greeting us until we ask for water. The waiter puts down the cups and the water jugs ,so the customers have to get water themselves.Afterwards the waiter comes over and waits for us to order , as he's waiting he reaches into his pocket and pulls out his fucking phone. Onto the food, the roasted duck was the best entr√©e that they served to us. I love chicken wings ,but their chicken wings were god awful no flavor whatsoever. In the end the bill was $77 for some garbage. As soon as I walked in I immediately knew that this restaurant wasn't going to be good. The waiter just had a nasty attitude. Don't waste your money on this overpriced garbage.
