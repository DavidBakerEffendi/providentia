By far the worst service I've ever encountered in my life. Not only did we ask for rice 3 times... it never came. Water wasn't filled once. Two ladies working and four tables seated. This place can sucks. I don't understand how you forget when someone's asks 3 times for a spacific item. Water? Cmon that's automatic. I don't care what excuse you have, that should never be forgotten. Last time I eat here. I don't recommend anyone eating here. We had to ask for our check 2 times and only when the next shift came we got our check. Go to honey pig. That place is better. Better food and service at honey pig.
