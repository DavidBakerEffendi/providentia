Update as of March 2016: We had been told that there were major changes in the restaurant since the last time we were here. Apparently the bottom line was not doing well and there were changes in personnel. They also cut back the number of servers and it appears they also changed the prices. The biggest change that we noticed was in the service. We were in the restaurant for an hour and a half. We did get our salad after considerable amount of time. They never did manage to get to bring out our shrimp cocktail before we had to leave. Our server was very apologetic. However, the restaurant now being shortstaffed should not be my problem. Our water glasses were never refilled. We asked for a refill on the bread. It never came. Even trying to get the bill required that I ambush a food runner going to another table and telling him we were leaving and needed to have a check immediately. The price was also quite different than the last time we were here. The wedge salad alone was priced at $17.50. While it was quite good, it was not a $17.50 good salad! Not exactly a bargain, especially for a happy hour sitting in the bar. I won't be coming back.
