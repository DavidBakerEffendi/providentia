Ok, i get it... its valentines. We stood at the doorway for 15+ min, maybe even more and there was a table available so we took it. 10 min later the lady said she is by herself and cant handle the work load and our wait for hour food will be an hour. 

Shit happens, but restaurants are supposed to be ready for holidays.
