Disappointed 

I use to visit Fuddruckers often. However, I had not been to a Fuddruckers for years.  Today, after watching a movie at AMC Arrowhead, we decided to stop at Fuddruckers for a burger. 

This visit to Fuddruckers was disappointing to say the least. 
I wish I would have had my phone, so I could have taken a few  photos. The restaurant was partially full. We looked for a table but most of the empty tables were dirty as were the floors, windows, and condiment dispensers. I asked to have our table cleaned  and the staff member wiped it off with much of the table debris landing on our chairs, which we then cleaned ourselves. The staff member then walked up front to speak wuth a fellow work associate. It is hard to imagine, staff members passing by filthy tables, and make no attempt to clean the area.

We ordered bugers, fries, and onion rings. The onion rings were cold, my 1/3 pound burger was ordered medium well and it came out medium rare.  The produce at the "serve yourself" counter was fresh and that area was clean. The food was fair at best. We could have chosen a much cleaner restraunt with better food in that area. The serious lack of cleanliness was an issue for me. Management is clearly at fault.  I must say that all of the staff were friendly.  However, there is no excuse for the condition of this restaurant.  I will not go back.
