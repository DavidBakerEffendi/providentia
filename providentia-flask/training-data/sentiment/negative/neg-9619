I LOVE JIMMY JOHNS, but this location has a particular group working that have no idea what customer service is. I have been going to the locations in California for years and cannot believe that when i asked to put the oil and vinegar on the side- all 6 of them working said "no." They explained that it was because they "don't have anything to put it in." I asked if they could put it in one of the FREE water cups and i would just carry it and they also said "no." I just don't want my 10 dollar samich soggy when i get home, is that too much to ask!?
