I was expecting good things based upon the reviews. However, it wasn't very good at all. First of all, vthey need to take the word 'sushi' out of their name. 4 selections? Just because imitation crab is wrapped in rice doesn't mean you can call it sushi. The other food selections were luke warm at best.... There are much better places to go in the area
