Skye was a very unpleasant surprise. So loud you couldn't hear your dining companion across the table, in a crowded dining room. No specials, on a Saturday night. 

My companion ordered a burger from the pub side of the menu (which also includes fish tacos, banh mi, etc.). Specified medium rare. I ordered the Caesar salad and butternut squash ravioli.

Some minutes later, our meals arrived -- oops, no, a shrimp risotto and short ribs arrived, only to disappear back into the kitchen and then float out to the bar dining area.

Much, much later, the burger and ravioli arrived. The Caesar? No explanation for why it never made the scene; perhaps it was misdelivered as well and that table was so famished that they pretended it was theirs.

The ravioli were OK; the burger was overcooked and uninspired. And did I mention it was noisy? Didn't help that despite our request with our reservation for a quiet table, we were plunked down next to the piano.

Our waiter, while pleasant at the start, pulled a disappearing act. My companion would've wanted a second glass of wine, but never got the chance to ask. And perhaps if he'd glanced our way once or twice, he might've noticed that the salad hadn't arrived.

The only nice part of the experience was walking down the hall to the parking lot and experiencing blessed quiet.

For anyone still interested after this: Wines by the glass were reasonably priced. The clientele skews very old -- at least 75% of the 40 or so people in the dining room with us were clearly over 60. The menu selection is relatively limited and doesn't have much in the way of creativity.

We won't be going back.
