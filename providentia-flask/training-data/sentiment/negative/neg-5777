My review is for the catering services which I had to call a centralize number. I called in an order at 11:10 AM for nine hamburgers nine orders of fries it took me 20 minutes for the person to reply that that was during the rush-hour and they could not process the order it was too large.  They could not work in an order for nine hamburgers to pick up at 11:45?   Could they have not just told me that the first place?  By the time they answered my question I stopped by the store and it was not even extremely busy.  There is a lot of competition in the hamburger market and this customer service was extremely poor.
