I was excited when a new restaurant came to the corner of Orchard and Regent, but my excitement was short-lived after eating there a few times.

On my first visit, I orderedsomething off the overhead menu and was told the price was actually higher than listed there.  Ooookay.  

On my second visit, the cashier constantly swore at the new cash register as she battled to make it work.

I tried a different dish on three visits, and each tasted like the last.  Which is to say it had no flavor at all.   Have these people never heard of seasonings?  And lamb is so easy to good and so tasty, yet they somehow managed to cook all the flavor out of the meat.

I have been warning friends to stay away, and now you've been warned too.
