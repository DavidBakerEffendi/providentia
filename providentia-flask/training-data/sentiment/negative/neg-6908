If you think this place has good dim sum, you're either new or one of those douchebags who shops at whole foods. Been (taken here) twice and both times were incredibly disappointing. 

Dim sum should come hot and quick and flavorful. Luckee did not meet any of these requirements. Both times.

Do yourself a favor and go to Asian Legend where you'll get way better dim sum and service for a fraction of the price.
