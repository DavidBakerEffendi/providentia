here is how it all started:
checked in, got a dirty room

complained about dirty room, they gave us another room (room#2) a couple suites over. very filthy, ripped wallpaper, dirty tables, mirrors etc...

complained about dirty room yet again, they gave us another room (room#3) a couple suites over. very filthy, dirty tables, mirrors etc again... (there was cum stains on the dresser table, disgusting)

at this point i requested to speak to a manager, they would do whatever was in their power to not allow me to talk to the manager. they did not allow me to talk to the manager.

finally, we got a 4th room. (all within 6 hours, huge waste of time/vacation time) they are very slow to deal with problems but very quick to take your money and rip you off!

keep in mind... if tables are dirty... how dirty are the beds? 

i mentioned to the "apparent manager" that this service was unacceptable in a resort of this standard and we actually feel we are staying at circus circus (worst rated on the strip)

the manager of this hotel did nothing to rectify my issue.

i even went to social media and posted a complaint

nothing was done.


they don't care, they just want your $ and that's it.

note to manager:

better way to handle this, upgrade your unhappy client to a better suite. (do i need to tell you how to do your job?)


this is a real review!
