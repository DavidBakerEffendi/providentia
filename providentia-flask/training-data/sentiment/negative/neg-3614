One of the worst Asian buffets ever. Definitely do not go by the pictures. The only food picture that looked the same was the ice cream and toppings bar. Their sushi was small, the ones you buy from the store are better then theirs. They did not have crab legs, baked mussels or any other seafood that looked fantastic. Their orange chicken was warm and tough. Their Thai tea tasted burnt. I asked for a refund and was told you took too long to ask for one. The cashier basically told me the price is $7.50 and you get what you paid for.  Sad to her that from a worker. I wasn't expecting the best food in the world. But was expecting the food to be ok and have crab legs. They should update their pictures. Very disappointing.
