Iced Coffee was ordered & waitress dropped the glass onto table which shattered & soaked my new white blouse, shorts, & phone that was on the table. My husband rushed to grab the phone & take it to the bathroom to try and save my screen protector, phone case, and ultimately the phone. I jumped up to go the bathroom & try to clean the coffee out of my new white blouse which obviously was unable to happen.  I wish we had thought to take pictures because I honestly dont think anyone who wasnt there will understand how completely soaked my outfit & phone got. While I understand accidents happen this was not handled well by the restaurant or management. The table was cleaned while we sat there & we were never offered to move to a new/clean table. We continued to find pieces of glass & areas where coffee had not been cleaned for the duration of our meal. While I sat in a coffee soaked blouse my meal also did not come out correctly. When I finally received my correct meal of raspberry topped pancaked I asked for a little extra topping because there was very little on my pancakes. My husband noticed once the bill was brought to us that we were charged $1.29 for the "extra" topping. We were shocked that no manager came to check on us or see if there was anything they could do to fix the situation. We brought guests from out of town with us & this was the experience they witnessed. Very disappointed in this frequently visited Ihop & this is a great example of how NOT to run a business.
