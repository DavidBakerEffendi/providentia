Service is abysmal (no exaggeration). Wings are great but unfortunately not worth the wait. Over 2 hours from start to finish for wings. I could have driven to East Coast Wings in Kannapolis, ate and drove home in the same amount of time with WAY less frustration.  This place could be so good but in the end it is just not.  Maybe we will try again next year.
