As far as the food goes, it's edible to say the least. The chicken Parmesan is really the only thing I had that I enjoyed. The place is smaller than I anticipated and the variety is lacking. The desserts were okay. While trying to pay the cashier INSISTED that we get a rewards card or something to pay ~$9 per person. We were already hungry and our friend finally got one of those damn cards. We get to the cashier again and she tells us that we need 2 cards to pay half price for 4 people. Ugh. To boot, the cashier moved at a glacial pace. Dear god. We were hungry and this lady is taking her sweet time to finish the transaction and giving us shade. The waiting staff was pleasant, though. It'd be more worth it to just spend your money on fast food. McDonald's anyone?
