On a recent dinner at the Peoria Texas Roadhouse, the bill folder was returned to me with someone else's VISA card inside. I immediately looked for our waitress but it took a few minutes to track her down. After explaining the error, she ran to find the owner of the card, but that person had already left. The waitress told her manager, who had no idea what to do. I told the manager to contact the number on the back of the other card to contact that cardholder and get her back to the restaurant.

During the hour that passed while waiting for this issue to be resolved, no one offered us beverages, or dessert, or anything to make the waiting less irritating. And when the other cardholder finally returned, the manager was going to charge us for the dinner! 

I refused to pay and all the manager had to say was, "OK."

Inexperienced  and discourteous staff make this Texas Roadhouse a restaurant we'll never patronize again.
