This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with in n' out in my entire 29 years on this planet. This chain closes at 1:30 AM on Saturday nights. I specifically pulled up at 1:29 AM when they proceeded to turn the lights off in the drive-through and failed to even acknowledge my presence. They served the car in front of me yet failed to even speak to me. This is not my first rodeo upon closing hour, and the right thing to do would have been to take one last order before that 1:30 mark. We pulled up and they made sure to cut the lights 30 seconds AFTER we pulled up into the drive-through. This is the closest chain to my house but sadly I will not be returning unless somebody makes it right. Sincerely, a very unhappy camper.

***Update - we were all drinking and had the munchies which makes this experience that much more painful
