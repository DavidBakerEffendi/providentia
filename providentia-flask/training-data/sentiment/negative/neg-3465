The worst food ever. Please don't waste your time going here. Was craving Singapore Noodles. Ordered take out. OMG! I think it was made by someone who never tasted noodles, never mind Singapore Noodles. It was tasteless. Just boiled rice Vermicelli.
Ordered a Thai Red Curry. Didn't even smell good. So you can imagine the taste. No lemongrass or nothing Thai about it. It tasted like a regular Curry with Curry powder. 
Dragon Noodle, tasted like wax.
Called the restaurant & told them about it immediately. They didn't seem to bother about it. Just said they will let the Chef know. 
We had to get Burgers & that was our dinner.
Before you start cooking food from another region you should first learn the taste. Taste it from other restaurants & then match it.
Definitely won't be going here ever again.
