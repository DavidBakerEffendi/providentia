I complained quite some time ago.  I wrote the manager of the Branch @ Diamond Center and when I didn't hear back, I wrote the main location on 10/30/2013.  I was told to call the Diamond Center location - which I did three times.  All three times, there was no manager available - even though I asked for them by name or a general manager.  NO ONE WAS AVIALBLE.  

All three times, I left my name and two phone numbers where I could be reached.  NEVER HEARD BACK ----   A LOSING SITUATION ALL AROUND.  We will never EVER - eat at this Brown Derby or any other Brown Derby and make sure we explain/tell our story every chance we get.  

I wanted answers - not a free meal, not money off our next visit - there will never be a next visit.  I wanted a call back and answers to why this happened & to bring the problems to the manager's attention so it would not happen to other customers.

It's obvious The Brown Derby Corp. does NOT care about anyone but making their money.
