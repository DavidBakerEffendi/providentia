I have my go to Chinese/Cantonese's restaurants that have never failed me....tonight I decided to try a new spot..... Big mistake. 
Lemon chicken was extremely dry, even with sauce. 
Beef and broccoli, tasteless. 
Cantonese noodles was on par with the rest of the meal.....tasteless.
Overall overpriced and plain. 
Don't waste your $$$.
