It is not a good place for vietnamese Pho. Food is not good. I had bad experience with them. I went with my dad and they added tips without consent. When I signed the receipt I added another 15% tip on top of it, without noticing they already charge me for gratuity. Come on, tip should be added willingly not hiddenly charged. Be careful and check the receipt guys, this place is self-serve.
