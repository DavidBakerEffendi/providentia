The staff is nice but the owner does some poor business practices. Was at a volleyball tournament there and no outside water was allowed, that is okay as long as you provide a water cooler. He did, which I was like cool, but the water was horrible, spit it out as soon as I tasted it. I found out he uses well water because it tastes bad and he wants to sell $2 bottles of water and $3 Gatorade.  Serving water that tastes like that is wrong. I will never support Razzles business based on his drive for money and lack of customer service and poor human decency. If you are willing to serve bad water to force people to buy water or other beverages, what other short cuts are you willing to take to make money on the food. Judging by the other reviews I assume most people are not happy with the food. Stay away!
