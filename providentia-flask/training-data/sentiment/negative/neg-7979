After a long drive to Vegas my friend and I decided to treat ourselves to some Fat Tuesdays but when entering Dicks we met with the RUDEST old man sever ever. He started off by just glaring at us as we walked in, and not even bothering to greet us. We approach the counter to order he scoffs and says "Where are your IDs??" He then checks our IDs and proceeds to TOSS them across the counter and looks at us and yells "Now what do you want??" Finally after our unpleasing encounter we grab our drinks and proceed to pay. Here is when we meet with another crappy sever... Each of our drinks came out to $17 and we both gave him a $20 bill. He then just takes our money, walks away, and doesn't give us our change...  He didn't ask if we needed change he just thanks us, says bye and continues on with his conversation with a coworker. Like wtf?! Are you seriously going to tip yourself after you did nothing and your old hag of a coworker scolded us?? Unbelievable. At this point my friend and I were so offended that we just walked out, letting those stupid servers take our change.  I get that the theme to this place is to act like a dick but at no point was there a joke cracked or any kind of sarcastic humor. Point is I will NEVER be coming back to that place.
