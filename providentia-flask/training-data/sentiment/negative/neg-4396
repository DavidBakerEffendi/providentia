I understand being busy but worst place ever. First asked for lemon 3 times for water. Then spilled a glass of water which the waiter saw but offered no napkins or help in cleaning up. Never refilled the water. After 45 minutes we finally asked about our food to be told their iPad went down and our order was never put in. As a server you should notice food not out for 45 minutes. Nothing was offered to make up for this and they just let us leave. No apologies or anything. A server forgets to put our order in then lies about it and we are out the time and leave starving. Very disappointed and will not ever be back.
