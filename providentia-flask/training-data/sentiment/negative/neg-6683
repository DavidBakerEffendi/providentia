Eh. I don't know.
The ambiance is cool but, nothing great sticks out to me...considering the amount you pay for your food; it was meh.

Eva Longoria's special guacamole tasted like any other guac. The bread and the butter were less than good..the bread was cold.
And since they were sold out on the lamb, I had filet with foie gras on top and the steak was salty. It had nothing to do with the foie; I think their steak rub is on the salty side.

The service was good but, I'm not sure if it's cuz that's how they normally are or cuz we complained to the manager prior to service.
Day before dinner, we went to Eve (the club upstairs) and were treated badly by their bouncers.

p.s. The restaurant's women's bathroom is upstairs (in said club) and I thought that was weird because I saw all the bartenders, goo dancers, and servers before club opening. And if it's a fancy steakhouse, shouldn't they have their own restrooms IN the actual restaurant? If anything, that's what stood out most for me.......isn't that sad??!??
