when i first went to this car wash i thought it was outstanding. i told neighbors that it was worth the cost. since then they car wash has broke the windshield wiper (on back window) they didnt even tell me. just put the wiper on the seat. next time they broke the lever on the car seat. the manager looked at me like i was making things up. the last 4 times i have taken my car into the place they have done a terrible job on the cleaning of the car-especially the windows. i will never go back to this place. 
very disappointed!
