So my boyfriend and I were hungry and decided to check out the buffet. Seating was quite fast which is a plus.We sat down and I told him to go check things out first. He came back with a piece of meat and a few other things. Nothing worth noting. I then took my turn and was totally disappointed with the choices but more disappointed in how unappetizing everything was. I came back with a piece of chicken, a mini taco ( the only thing that looked appealing out of the whole buffet) and some Mac & Cheese. My boyfriend took one bite out of his meat and spit it out. It was ALL fat. I took a bite out of the mac and cheese and felt like i wanted to vomit! Everything was DISGUSTING!  to put it simply. I knew from the price not to expect much but to literally felt sick after. 

I meant it was a complete waste of time, I will never ever go back there. I have never had such a bad experience at a Buffet before and now that I think about it, it's no wonder they give out so many comp coupons.... they NEED ppl to eat there.

Word to the wise your better off going to the little sports deli or the paradise cafe.
