We normally enjoy this location. We go on Tuesdays or Saturdays for Kids Eat Free because we honestly can not see spending $40 plus tip for breakfast at a Dennys. We can eat at a fancy place like Abuelos for $45 plus tip. We went in 2 weeks ago on a Tuesday night. Yummy meal except the new chef had no clue how to poach an egg...come on now and AFTER  I paid the bill I realize the did NOT give me the kids eat free. The waitress actually tells me that I have to ASK for it. I am sorry but it advertised on the outside of the building that kids eat free on Tuesdays. I am pretty sure its illegal to tell me I have to ask for it. If not,its very unfair practice. I demanded they refund the amound and re ring up the order. The manager is called and tells me she can not do that. I am sorry but I am a business owner and used to work retail. YES you can refund and re ring the order. When I asked her what she would do to fix it she just tells me to come in anytime and get the kids eat free. I asked her for a coupon or something said this. She just takes my name and says that good enough. We all know that if we go in and she is not there, they will have NO clue what is going on AND how long is she going to keep my name in her pocket. Bad eggs and awful service!
