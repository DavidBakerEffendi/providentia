WORST customer service for subpar, overpriced food!!! My son loves Whataburger... but, after my HORRIBLE experience today, I will NOT be returning to this location again!! The girl who works the drive thru at the Chandler Blvd and I-10 location was beyond rude with the WORST attitude problem!! Whataburger should really re-evaluate who they allow to represent their business.  If I could give 0 stars to this location, I would!!
