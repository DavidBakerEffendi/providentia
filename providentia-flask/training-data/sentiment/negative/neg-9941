Went to Dickey's - had such a taste for BBQ.  Food was good - but not worth the money.  I walked in.  Got a beef brisket sandwich for my son - around $8.00.  Well; ok.  Ordered a full rack of ribs and two small sides for myself.  $30.00 - REALLY???!!!

Giant Eagle pre-cooked ribs were just as good - and were $13.99 per full rack - same 12 bones.  Smoke BBQ grill's full rack (12 to 13 bones) is $19.99 with a side of fries for two people....

All three places have great ribs with the meat falling off the bone.  Nothing special about any of their sauces...  I don't know which I like or dislike more (sauces).

JUST NOT WORTH $30.00.  I had a taste for BBQ - not to have a hole burned in my wallet!!!  

NOT HAPPY AT ALL.

Yelp should have them @ $$$$ not $$.
