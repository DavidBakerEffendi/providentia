I guess I should have checked the 1 star review before picking a review for my starving child.  I've been STUCK in this drive thru for 27 minutes for a happy meal. The ladies at the first window didn't even speak English.  After I finally made it to the second the guy was able to crack a joke with me so I wasn't so grumpy... I'm sure he was used to getting the s**t end of it all. 

Bottom line...theres a million McDonald's.. I'll NEVER go to this one again. I've gotten my food at a restaurant faster than that. Luckily... my 18 month old didn't care his fries were cold. And I don't even eat at mconalds... thus was all for ONE UN-HAPPY MEAL.
