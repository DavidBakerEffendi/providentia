Don't waste your time and go someplace else!  My father and I have been to many locations of Roy's over the years, so when visiting Las Vegas he wanted to go.  That decision was a complete let down.  Atmosphere was completely bland and felt like you were eating in an office.  The waiter did not inform us about a non item special, Chilean Sea Bass, we had to ask.  When the food arrived my Mahi Mahi was over cooked and had no flavor, Dads fillet was under cooked, and the special Chilean Sea Bass was such a small piece of fish.  We ordered some lava cake and espresso for dessert. The lava cake had an extremely hard bottom that could not be cut with a steak knife, and the espresso never showed up.  Had to ask the waiter a second time for the espresso, and he was nice enough to not charge us for it.  For the prices this place charges, everything should be perfect and the food should make you scream with joy.  I will never suggest nor dine at this restaurant again.
