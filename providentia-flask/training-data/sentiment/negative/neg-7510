The last thing you can do is to serve Costco's Naan. This is the main  reason I am writing this review.

Chicken curry was ok but the chicken was hard. 
Gobi Manchurian was too sweet, i guess the chef ended up adding more sauce.
Very disappointed and wont recommend this place for good authentic Indian food.
