Went through the drive thru on my lunch break. Only a few cars but the parking lot was packed! Maybe because it's new...? Definitely not because it's good. 

Ordered a chicken Cobb salad with avocado and an iced tea. For $12 it was a little pricey. Drink is small and salad is probably an average size. I'm a little bit of an iced tea snob and I didn't like it, I don't think it was powdered but just didn't like the kind they brewed. I didn't get the salad I ordered. That's annoying to me especially in a drive thru- at lunch. I drive off thinking I get the right one and I don't have time on my lunch break to go fix it. They need to get it right. Also, they gave me a bread roll. The roll was just floating around in the bag. Not in anything, no butter, nothing. I found that very strange.

The drive thru girl was not nice or friendly to top it all off.  

Will I go back? No. Will I pick Kneaders over Panera? EVERY TIME.
