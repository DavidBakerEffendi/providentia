Place is not even worth walking in.  Prepackaged garbage, no flavor, wait staff knows nothing, the place looks nice but that's really about it. Thank god we took advantage of the LVAC discount because I would have been so pissed to pay full price for this fake food. The ramen was more than likely the worst I have ever had. Never going back! The server sucked from the beginning we walks in till the end, she knew nothing about the menu and could not even recommend what order lol! She sucked! Omg I can't believe this place gets any good reviews, it's a joke. Don't waste your time on this place. You must listen to this review. Stay away!!
