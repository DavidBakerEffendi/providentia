I went in super excited about grass fed beef! Lol this place is rude! The waitress was slack, she left us feeling abandoned! The food was extremely disappointing again! The burger was $15 and $3 more to add anything to it... For $18 it shouldn't look like a kids meal!  The regular fries were under cooked and greasy. I sent my burnt sweet potato fries back and got a  snotty reply from the chief sent out "they were charred" lol charred would have soft fluffy potato inside not about to break my teeth! The steak was ok but again way overpriced the quality is not there! This was my second time trying to eat here both very unpleasant!  Our food did not look like the pictures showed!
