The food was better than expected but the other aspects were far worse.

I got a decent parking spot so I was in a good mood for my dinner.  Appetizers came and we were so hungry we tucked into them and in no time they were gone.  More bread.

The entree, I don't want you to continue reading.  Wait ten minutes staring at this sentence.  Wait ten more minutes staring at this sentence.  I bet you just kept reading.  I didn't have that option.  With a squad of hungry children flailing about we waited over forty minutes after the apps, and that is even longer than our order time, for our food.

It took forever and our waiter avoided us most of that time.  It was excruciating with children flipping over complaining they are starving.  I was feeling the same way.  I made it through part of my meal and then I didn't feel well.  I wanted to pay and leave.  That took far longer and we had some bill errors that had to be fixed.  The entire thing took even longer.  I wasn't feeling well and the moment I got my credit card back I bolted for the door.

Get your dessert here and you are fine.  Order an entree at your own risk.  I suggest Maggianos for drinks and food, and the factory for cake.
