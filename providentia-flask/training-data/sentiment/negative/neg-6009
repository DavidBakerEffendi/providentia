I have never given 1 star to any restaurant because no matter how bad it is there's no reason for 1 star, until this happened to me. Came in with a group of 5 on a weeknight around 8pm. We didn't have a reservation, but saw some empty tables outside, thought we'll give it a try since the review on Yelp was good. Walked in they were busy, there's really only 1 waitress there, so we waited a few mins until she would get us seated. When she approached us, we got denied for a table when she knew there's 5 of us. In confusion I asked if the tables empty were all booked up, her respond was no but she didn't have the capacity for 5 people. We were even confused at that point, can't they add a chair or combine two tables together? I have never heard of a restaurant that doesn't serve groups of 4 or more, we were definitely offended at this point and we left.
