I really can't believe the overall rating of this restaurant. The lady and I went through the drive through last night to try a burger and fries. What we received was absolutely disgusting. To begin don't view me as a burger snob that won't eat a fast food burger because that's far from true. The burgers we received reminded me of McDonald's and I mean that in a very negative way. Burgers were extremely thin and rubbery. I believe they advertise 100% ground beef but if so they absolutely ruined this beef. After getting home and taking a few bites we fed the remainder of the burgers to our dog Paco. I've been a long time user of Yelp but never reviewed a place. This is what caused me to sign up. I would never be back. Although the staff was actually very friendly the burgers were overpriced! $10 for a burger meal compared to a Wendy's combo of like $7-8 I would pick Wendy's every single time. Will never return.
