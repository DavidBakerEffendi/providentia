Disgusting!

I like Popeye's Chicken; its a unique spin on (fast) Chicken for this area of Pittsburgh....

**I am writing a review for THIS location, however... and its not good.**

Every time we ordered something the rude kid at the counter said "hold on, lemme see if we got any left"

The self-serve Soda station (where the condiments, lids, straws and napkins were located) was an absolute mess.   Spills, trash, and there were no napkins in either napkin holder and they were out of lids.

The kids behind the counter were more concerned with talk of football amongst each other than waiting on my husband and myself.

The Manager on duty was nothing more than a kid, himself, and he was acting just the same as the others and made NO attempt to actually manage his staff.

We didn't get the correct order (and we were the only ones there!).
Some of my chicken was undercooked.
Most of my husband's meal was dried out (like it had been sitting for hours).
There was NO hot water in the bathroom when I went to wash my hands after eating (dang chicken residue--lol); I asked my husband about the men's room and there wasn't any hot water in there either.


PROS:  
its located, conveniently, on Rt. 22 in Monroeville (the last remaining location in our area).

CONS:
everything else
