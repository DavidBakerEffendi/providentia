I am new to town and had a recommendation by a friend to come visit this place. The interior is nice and the atmosphere is as well however the service I had was awful. I waited in front to be seated for 5-10 minutes before someone acknowledged me. Once I was seated and ordered my food took almost 40 minutes and tasted like everything came out of the microwave. I got the late night happy hour menu and cheap does not mean poor quality !!
