Not a big fan of this restaurant at all. Everyone in there were so pretentious. After all, it's just sandwich and soup. The sandwich bread was so tough to bite into, it was very dry. The soup was okay. 
I have to admit that they have a nice decor, but that was it. The waitress did not give me a single smile. 
I would never go back to this place where everyone was pretending they were in a Micheline restaurant. I would prefer a warm and welcoming restaurant to have soup and sandwich and pay half the price.
