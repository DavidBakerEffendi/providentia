RUN AND RUN FAST! I get it. I realize fast food is fast food. Really I do. I have an iron stomach and take into consideration that the people preparing these meals for us either don't care of just don't know any better. Fine. 

Having said all that....HAPPYS PIZZA at this location, is ridiculous. I have given this place FIVE chances to redeem themselves. Each time was delivery and each time it was AT LEAST 20 minutes late and something was either missing or wrong. The last meal was comped by the manager (Mike) and was then WRONG again...even with notes on my account supposedly putting some extra attention on the order. When I complained, I was laughed at and talked down to by the idiot they put in charge of the restaurant. VERY GHETTO and VERY HORRIBLE!!!! STAY AWAY!!!
