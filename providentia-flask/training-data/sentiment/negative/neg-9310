Maryvale Terrace Shopping Center, 4105 N 51st Ave # 151, Phoenix, AZ 85031

I checked three websites and I called twice -- to make sure -- I have the right restaurant and the right location of this chain of restaurants.

I double dog dare you to go there and eat a whole meal-- HORRIBLE!

I swear to God, I swear to everything that is holy to me this is the worst food I've ever had in my life. DOG FOOD. 

To put that into perspective, well, proper perspective, I have been made ill by restaurants and their food, and I dislike this dump more. 

The man stands back in the kitchen conducting business like he knows something - he doesn't know anything let alone tasting quality!

HEY! I've had three dishes in three visits and they all taste like dog food. The spicy Thai beef tasted like horribly-tasting spicy dog food meat. Oh, the orange hue on the beef is odd in and of itself. The curry is Dog Food Soup. What little flavor was there is quickly even buy the rice and you are just left for the plate full of mush. Dog food mush. 

I didn't have anything against these people until they served me horrid food for money. They don't know what the F their doing, they don't know what the F their serving, stay away from this dump,  
I beg of you!
