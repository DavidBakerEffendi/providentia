I've been to at least 7 Sammy's locations and always think their service is great, except for this one. Came in for dinner with my wife at 7 pm on a Saturday. Got seated promptly and then waited for over 10 mins before we bounced. Place had 8 tables of customers and was over half empty. As we are walking out the manager comes over and asked if she could help us. If it was busy I would have understood.  

She could have helped tell the four severs who were carrying on in the kitchen they had customers except she was one of the ones carrying on. Won't be back to this Sammy's.
