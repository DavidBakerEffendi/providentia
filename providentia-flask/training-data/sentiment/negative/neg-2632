DO NOT COME TO THIS HOTEL!!!!!
Came here for my Bachelorette weekend 4 of us stayed in a suite. We checked in on a Thursday we only received room service 1 time on Friday we left our room came back 4 hrs later and room service had come in to clean and restock towels. It wasn't until the next day Saturday that one of my bridesmaid notice her charger and beats headphones was missing. She called hotel security they took a report from her and that was it. The next day Sunday my maid of honor received a call from her credit card company telling her they notice fraud activities.  They told her over $600 was swiped at different stores. She had 3 cards with her and one card she left in her bag in the room and that card went missing Friday room service came in our room stole her card and went on a fucking shopping spree. We called the cops and called hotel security again they did absolutely nothing this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel this hotel ruined what was supposed to be a fun great weekend. I will never come back to this hotel again and I would advice every one to boycott this hotel. They have thieves working here and they are doing nothing about it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE THEY WILL ROB YOU BLIND. I checked other reviews on here and Facebook and relized other people made reviews saying they stuff had been stolen from this hotel as well.
