Overpriced in our opinion. 21 dollars for a burger with a greasy bun and soggy lettuce and a very dry crouton side dish......what was that?
Four dollars for a side of syrup for the French toast and a dollar for water.  I don't mind paying for great food, but this was average at best.  Won't return for weekend lunch/brunch.
