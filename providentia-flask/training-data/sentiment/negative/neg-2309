There wasn't one specific thing that made this buffet so horrible... It's just the accumulation of everything being less than average quality. There are plenty of options, but none of them were flavorful, hot, or worth filling up on.

Some others have commented on the dessert section being worthwhile, but to us everything tasted unthawed and on the stale side. The Asian section had probably the best offerings but all were still fairly bland.

The worst part is that when I was going to grab a slice from the pizza station, someone had placed the tongs directly on TOP of the pizza... So all the hand germs were in direct contact with the food! There were two workers right there who didn't think this was disgusting.. I would have discarded the slices.

My husband and I both left with unsatisfied stomachs and looked forward to the second dinner we would have a few hours later at a much better establishment.
