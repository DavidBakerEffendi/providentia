Let me start by saying the buffet, initially, had a much better selection of seafood but it appears they have decided profit was more important than remaining true to their mission. The lunch buffet has turned into a standard Chinese buffet. They no longer offer sashimi, the sushi rice is barely covered with narrow, thin pieces of fish and most of their seafood dishes are typical of other buffets. What a huge disappointment!

They failed to refill the tempura station, even though there was only 3 pieces of bell pepper in the tray, and the sushi chef was so focused on slicing razor thin pieces of fish, he could barely keep up with restocking the platters. I won't be going back to Jogoya and wouldn't recommend them for lunch, unless you want typical, greasy Chinese food. It's unfortunate they have decided to settle for less than mediocre offerings. I'm not sure if Pacific Seafood Buffet has followed a similar path, but I'm not willing to find out.
