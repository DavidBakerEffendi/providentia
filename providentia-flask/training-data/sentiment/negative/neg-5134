So I got a message from the chef today wondering how to render a pork (really) so here's how to render the fat off of pork belly, a piece of pork belly is usually 30 to 20% fat(Quality is key) so what you need to do is cook it low and slow to render the fat, cook it at about 2:25 in the oven for 3/5 hours, , fatty and not so fatty, your welcome, you can get  more information on  how to cook it at bon appette, good luck
