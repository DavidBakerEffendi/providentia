Only thing that was good was the salad section...Customize your own salad and they will make it for you! Except that there was only one person working so there would be a long and pointless line up....

Sushi section: Way too much rice and the fish didn't look fresh. The little sides of bean sprouts and kimchi were good though.

Meats: Um, all were dry with no flavor...they put the BBQ sauce there to make it seem less dry and to overpower everything, but it's ultimately a horrible cover up for horrible food. Only meat that was passable was the veal. Very soft and yum.

Seafood (cold): Crab legs were salty and you have to peel the shrimp yourself. 

Seafood (warm): Fish was not good at all. Dry, fishy...just bleh! Clam chowder on a plate? Not that great...fried clams were break-your-teeth hard. Rolled flounder was really weird tasting as well. I don't recommend the seafood at all. 

Desserts: Everything looked really plain. Cheesecake was "meh." Not much flavor or creaminess...and I love cheesecake :( Some strawberry pudding shortcake thing was not bad...fruit tart was extremely horrible. All the tarts were burnt so I just ate the fruit with some gelatin that was more hard than "fluffy-pudding" and slid right off the burnt pre-made tart. Ugh. Disgusting. Don't waste your time on this...

In fact, don't waste your time on this buffet, period! You could get something way better anywhere (with the exception of possibly circus circus). Just suck it up and spend maybe $5-$10 dollars more for Wynn or Aria buffet!
