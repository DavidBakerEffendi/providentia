Ordered the oxtail soup for lunch. It was terrible. The oxtail was tough because it hasn't been cooked long enough. The broth had no flavor and was completely bland. There wasn't enough noodle. A bland mess.

The restaurant was very busy. The waitress was very nice, but she couldn't speak English.

Will I return? I doubt it since there are many better restaurants in the area.
