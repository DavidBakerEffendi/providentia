If they had a zero star that wouldn't be low enough!!!!!!! This place used to be so good and now it's under new ownership and prepare yourself!!!! The pizza is cardboard the sauce is bland and it's just overall awful! They forgot the salads and the delivery driver didn't even want to drive back and get the salads and so we tried the pizza, I ordered gluten free because they used to carry it and the man I spoke to said the dough was good for up to a year in the freezer so I thought ok if you say so well I've been eating gluten free for some time this pizza is so disgusting I don't think a person who was starving and hadn't eaten in days would eat this! I asked for garlic and they just actually plopped garlic off a spoon all over the pizza and considered it done! I can't even go on. We have no salads gross pizza and the only thing that was decent was the fried mushrooms and fried mozzarella sticks good thing you can't mess those up! I'm telling you beware this is not the same place and I will NEVER! GO! BACK! Horrible! When I called back to tell them how awful it was the girl on the phone gave me an attitude and said the owner would call me back when he wasn't busy! Way to go management for handling a complaint! Just horrible horrible horrible! Oh and they said they would send out the driver with the salads and it's been over 30 minutes with no sight of him returning!!!
