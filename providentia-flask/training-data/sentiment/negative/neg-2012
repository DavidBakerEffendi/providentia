If you have to park every car that pulls in fine but at least remember which car had what. After 10 minutes of being parked and cars behind me getting there food I got out to go inside. A man in front of me was inside returning food because they gave him the wrong order. I hand the lady my ticket and she tries to hand me the bag this man just gave her, talking about we couldn't find you. 
Literally lied right to my face instead of owning the mistake and remaking the food I had been waiting damn near 20 minutes for. Do they even have health cards? Trying to hand me food that had left the damn store and was now sitting under a heat lamp. Burger King get it together and train your employees.
