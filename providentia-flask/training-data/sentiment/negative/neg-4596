Let me start off by saying I visit DD on almost a daily basis, it's definitely my first choice for when I need my coffee. I go to this location mainly because it is right in front of my neighborhood. Today I went through the drive through and there was nobody else in line. At the window this guy just says "here" and hands me my coffee. Kinda rude but it doesn't really phase me, just trying to get my caffeine. They forgot to give me a straw and seemed annoyed that I even asked for one. I was putting my debit card back in my wallet and putting the straw in my coffee while I was still parked, and the manager comes to the window and says "so did you need anything else?" Um no, I don't. Just trying to be responsible and put my stuff away so I don't have to do it when I'm driving. There was NOBODY in line. I don't know who the blonde woman is who runs this place but she is clearly miserable and it makes her customers uncomfortable. C'mon guys, don't make me find a new coffee place... one star only for the coffee.
