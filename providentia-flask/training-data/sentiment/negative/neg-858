My wife and daughter ordered sesame chicken a few days ago. Both orders came without sesame, so she called the store and was told to return at her convenience and her order would be replaced at no charge. Today, she returned to get her sesame chicken and the owner was there. The owner said that she would not replace the order and offered a 3.00 compensation to include both messed up orders. As she said this she put the fresh sesame chickenb orders behind the counter, as if afraid they may be stolen. For this she lost three good customers as we ordered from this place frequently. Their cheapness has lost them both customers and money. I hope this shortsighted person learns her lesson as we won't be back.
