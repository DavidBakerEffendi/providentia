super SALTY soup(No free rice served). I asked the cook to change my soup & add more water in but still SUPER SALTY, & finally I didn't touch that soup again during the dinner). 

Also I'd never seen such a super MINI bowl of soup before (Half of the regular size you can see in other Korean restaurants), & it costed me more than 10 bucks. You can get way much larger amount of Delicious, Sincere & Authentic Korean food at any other places! Even the food court at the Green Land Korean Market is way much better!

Plus it's tooo Loud! I had to yell to make my friend hear me - even though she's sitting right in front of me!
