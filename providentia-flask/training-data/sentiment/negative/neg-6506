VERY DISAPPOINTED! Microscopic lemongrass soup very expensive and worst than everywhere else, in version coconut - they literally put milk from can straight to bowl and served as the other dish. Fried dumpling was so dry that impossible to eat.  Vermicelli noodles with vegetables  had no taste at all (few vegetables with old sauce from wok, mixed with ordinary noodles). In summary: food worst than in cheap thai places for the double price. Service slow, bad and insolent. NEVER AGAIN!
