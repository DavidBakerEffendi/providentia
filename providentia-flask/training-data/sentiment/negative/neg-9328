I am reducing this review to 1 stars bc as time goes on the more I'm regretting this meal. 

1. The menu was misleading bc the prices listed were in the $15-25 range per item but when We sat down they informed us that they were small plates so 2-3 per person was recommended. The menu didn't say anywhere that they were small plates. So for that much money, I expect the food to be dayum good. 

So when..
2. Their French onion soup was fairly large in size and the broth was good. but instead of a nice crusty/soggy bread covered with oozing provolone cheese, it was a tasteless puff-pastry kind of cracker with a crispy skin of cheese. Biiiiig disappointment. 

3. Their lobster pot pie was a decent size but it only had a top crust which was layers of puff pastry that was too thick to cut. Every time I tried, I just ended up shoving it down into the ramekin and spilling the contents everywhere. So eventually I ended up w/ a dense lump of sort of soggy bread that was still too chewy that I had to pick Around or fish out. This topper would've been much better on the soup. 

Also, it was way too tarragon-y. I was informed by the waitress that you could really taste the tarragon but was not told that it overwhelmed all the other flavors. The cream sauce was tasteless and too heavy, tough you did get some lobster flavor at the back end...

While I did get enough to eat, I left three hours later feeling gross and almost $60 poorer (wine included).
