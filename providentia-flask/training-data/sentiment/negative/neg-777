This was my first time in Paramount and this location. It wasn't as good as I expected from Lebanese food. I went there with my MealPal application subscription for lunch during day. Atmosphere is pleasant, style is right but I found the portions really small.. What surprised me was with Meal Pal we are supposed the get the same size portions but it wasn't so... especially the meat part, my beef shawarma was like half of what the regular customers got, so was very disappointed with the quantity... Taste was ok, although beef part looked kind of dry and there was just very little sauce. I wouldn't go there with my MealPal account for sure, if this restaurant wants to keep serving MealPal gals it should reconsider the amount they are preparing for them...
