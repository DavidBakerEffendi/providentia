When my family and I walked into the door the workers were laughing and talking loud while cursing. My 3 year old son is now saying, "shit" after one of the employees. Hopefully he doesn't start saying, "bitch" as well. My child never says bad words until now. The food was decent aside from a breakfast sandwich my husband had that was not freshly made. Won't be coming here again.
