Very disappointed with my order. We ordered through Uber eats and the restaurant did not follow any notes. We purchased over $100 worth of food and we were not satisfied nor were treated well. We called the manager and they would not even provide us our correct order by delivering it to our hotel. Food also was very low quality and disgusting. Sauce was plopped on top and cheese was not even melted. It's a disgrace to the Italian cuisine community and to my family and I. Do not order. This restaurant does not even deserve the one star I gave.
