Who's bright idea was it to have a traditional Japanese Kabuki exhibition on a small stage located in the lower right section of the Bellagio fountains? 
There were several thousand spectatiors, but only 5% of the people could see what was going on. 
The projection of the Koi fish on the fountain spray was nice, but that was about all that most could see.
It was about 100 degrees out there at 9:15PM, but with sweaty bodies all around on a hot August night this was more torture than pleasure.
A terrible event with poor planning. This was not a dream, it was a nightmare.

Get ready for another day or two of closures on the Las Vegas strip to remove the stage and props.
