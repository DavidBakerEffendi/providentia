I'd rather cook my next meal in bath water. This place is horrible. The service is bad. the wait staff do not speak English and are insanely rude. I'm Italian and can cook better than anyone in this pathetic restaurant, yet this nasty woman insisted on repeating how to use their stupid shabu pots. The "broth" tasted terrible. 

For those that haven't experience the Shabu style of cooking, it's basically like fondue-- only Asian. There's burners on the table and you cook everything yourself. 
one of the many issues with this place was that the burner controls are strategically placed so that you'll either bash your legs and knees on it every time you move. 

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. There are far to many restaurants to go in Vegas, bad service and bad food is not tolerated! I couldn't get out of this place fast enough....
