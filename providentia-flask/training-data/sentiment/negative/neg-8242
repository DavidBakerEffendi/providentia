What a disappointment! For a restaurant that showcases its' meat, it seems laughable that the hamburger meat quality was not as good as Burger King, complete with gristle and was overlooked. The seasonal salad had zero flavor, fries came out soggy the first time. The unsweetened ice tea was the only saving grace.
