I was in town for a business trip.  It was late.  I was hungry.  I just got gas before getting to the hotel to save time on the car rental return the next day and asked the folks at the gas station how this place was compared to Jack or Carl's and was told it was awesome.

It was far from awesome, it wasn't even that good.  The drink and lid were terrible, they didn't fit right and caused it to leak a little.  I got a chicken sandwich the bread was a cool idea but it just didn't work for the meal.  Nothing was overly terrible but versus some of the other local fast food places nothing really sets this place a part or stand out.  Maybe breakfast is good but...wasn't willing to go back.
