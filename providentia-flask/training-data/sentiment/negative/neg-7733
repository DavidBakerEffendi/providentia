I love Potbellys and it kills me to have to give them a 1 star. This star is not based off of the food - that was wonderful per usual, but this review is due to the guy that was rude to me for no reason. Normally customer service is great. I have been to this particular establishment many times during lunch as I don't work far and have always been treated with a smile, asked if I would be dining in and if not they bagged the food for me. Tonight was a different story. I walked in around 7:45pm, they close at 9. It was empty, except for the 3 workers. One individual named Morgan who helped me, was completely standoffish. I have never been treated with such disregard before. Not a smile, not asking if I was dining in; I bagged my own food and then when I asked if there were any oatmeal CC cookies left his response was - we close in an hour. I then proceeded to joke with him, which he clearly did not find amusing. Maybe it wasn't his sort of thing he would find funny (tried to get the 12 pack of mini oatmeal CC cookies for the price of a cookie), but I know with my many years in the customer service field - you laugh and make light of the situation. 
Basically you can go to this place for food - just hope and pray you don't have to deal with Morgan. He was rude, disrespectful and standoffish.
