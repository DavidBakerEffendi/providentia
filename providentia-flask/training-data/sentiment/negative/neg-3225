Disappointed!
I went in rushing because they were closing in 5 minutes and yes I know it can be annoying to be the last customers. But the lady decided to lie to me that  her " register was broken and it would let her ring someone out past 10pm and that it was ahead five minutes" just bec she did not want to make one more sandwich and my sandwiches are the easiest I get tuna with just lettuce on it! Very upsetting.  Her excuse didn't even make sense. The reason I know they weren't having computer problems is bec the day before some dude was raving they got new computers. Very annoying.
