My daughter has had a terrible experience the last two times she's been to the South Park Cheesecake Factory.  The first time the waiter spilled her fried zucchini and argued about getting more.  The second time she was overcharged for her meal.  We usually go several times a month, but with this horrible service we'll find another restaurant.  There are plenty to choose from in the area.
