The food we had tonight was pretty bad. I ordered the filet mignon, and it was covered with this sauce that was SO salty. After the first bite, I had lost my appetite. I scraped off as much of the sauce as I could, but it was still so salty. My wife ordered the bacon crusted salmon as part of the three course set meal. The salmon was also pretty salty. Her set meal came with a bread pudding dessert that was horrible. It was hard as a rock, cold, and felt like it was a week old. I ordered the pineapple upside down cake. I thought that also was mediocre at best. I didn't taste any pineapple in the cake. It came with coconut ice cream, but it was so dry, it tasted like it was several years old. The service was good, the waiter was very apologetic when I mentioned how salty the sauce was. We won't be coming back!
