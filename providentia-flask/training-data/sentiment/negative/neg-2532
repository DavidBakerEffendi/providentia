Deplorable service.  Handful of occupied tables and plenty of wait staff, yet it too forever to get our beverages and even longer to get someone to take our order.  Yet our waiter had time to stand and talk to people at another table for over 15 minutes. Finally another server took our order. The waiter came over to apologize and told us they were "slammed".  Seriously?  After waiting another 30 minutes for our order, we gave up and left.  We invested 45 minutes for nothing.
