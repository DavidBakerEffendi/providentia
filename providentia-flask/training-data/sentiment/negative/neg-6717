I hardly ever eat Burger King because let's be honest they are at the bottom of the fast food chain. However I was craving a burger and remembered their ad for the new Sourdough Bacon Swiss so I decided to try it out. I pulled into the outer drive thru lane at about 7 tonight and waited for nearly 10 minutes as the inside line continued to move. I pulled up to the second window and the woman, a middle aged VERY UNFRIENDLY black woman looked at me and said a total. I told her I hadn't ordered yet because it appears one of the drive they speakers isn't working. She didn't acknowledge what I said at all and responded with what do you want. She had NO customer skills whatsoever. She handed me my bag after it was ready without a word. Not a thank you, have a nice day, or even eye contact. So I had to wait for this very rude woman to realize I hadn't drove off to tell her she forgot my cheesecake and the condiments I requested. She then handed them to me with again not a word. Honestly Burger King isn't that great but this woman represents how bad their service has truly become.
However the burger was absolutely delicious and I really enjoyed it. Will I return? No because I don't like being treated like a nuisance when I'm just trying to buy dinner. 
They really should review their yelp as they have 2 stars and I'm sure the rude woman that ruined my experience has other negative reviews.
