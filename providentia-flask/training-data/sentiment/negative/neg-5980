Absolutely a joke compared to what it used to be. 

Management is clueless. Servers and bartenders are clueless. Bar special was $2.99 for miller lite and then bartender told me it was $3.25 after the first one I bought was $3 even. Price must have went up in the hour I was there. Sandwiches were jokes. Barely a handful of chips. Bar glasses smelled of skunk. When was the last time the tap lines were cleaned? $5.50 for a short Sam Adams????? I know this is a dive bar, but the girls working there are clueless clueless clueless. Can't make a drink. Can't find the beers. Can't remember orders. 

Ever hear of Jon Taffer? Read his book. Never going back.
