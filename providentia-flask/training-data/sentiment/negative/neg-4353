I am an extremely upset customer, I spend at the LEAST 50$ a week at this store! Today I ordered with I order every single day, an avocadolado and a Cali chicken club, they never get my order wrong so I didn't think to check the bag before I left. The Asian man who I am guessing is the manager, called out my name, "ARI!" There was only 2 other people in the store, pretty sure I'm the only Ari in the building! I grabbed the bad, said thank you and continued on my way to work, half way to the strip where I work I realized as I looked into the bad to grab my chips that there was a burrito, not a sandwich that I ordered. I called the store to ask if I can come get my sandwich or money back tomorrow since I'm 5 minutes away from work at this point and don't have time to turn around. The girl on the phone tried to tell me I grabbed the wrong bag!!! She blamed it on me!! The man called my name!!! It had my chips in it!!! Unbelievable! Then proceeded to tell me that he said I must keep the burrito and bring it in tomorrow! He expects me to keep a burrito in my hot car alllllllll day while I'm at work, or he wants me to carry it around with me at work? To prove that he gave me the wrong bag!!! I told the Girl on the phone that I am a loyal customer who has never had any issues and for him to expect me to carry around a burrito or leave it in my hot car and smell it up is fucking ridiculous and that I will be In tomorrow, and I better get my money back!!!! I also called Corperate. What a joke. Also I might add that while I was walking out there was a man arguing with him about wanting spinach in something, and I could hear the customer saying to him, "yeah I wanted spinach that's what I ordered!" Obviously this man has no sense of customer service and stop being a cheap ass and give his customers what the order and PAY FOR!! Also he should admit that obviously he shouldn't be making the food if he can't get the damn order right!
