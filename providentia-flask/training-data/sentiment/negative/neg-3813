Was in the area for a November OYE that was about to start in 30 minutes, but I was so hungry and didn't really think my second meal-of-the-day comprised of pie, cake, pastries, and wine was a healthy way to end the evening w/, so I decided I'd check out Red Devil.  It was dead inside (only a couple was there for dinner), and I got the feeling that most of the business that evening was going to be take-outs.

Bartender was friendly enough, until I started asking questions about the ingredients.  He still remained accessible, but the smiles certainly went away.  I almost stood up and left.  When the food arrived 25 minutes later, I wished I had left!  

I found the calzone crust soggy- no crispiness anywhere, and the mozzarella-ricotta mix made for an ugly, bland-tasting (I detected no ricotta flavor at all) conglomeration.  (See photos.)  The only thing that turned out OK was the marinara sauce, but what good is it if the item you're supposed to eat it w/ isn't worth the trouble?  I had the leftovers boxed, and stood up to go after only spending 5 minutes eating.  After all, I had a party to attend!

p.s. What a poor example of a treehugger I am!  No sooner had I exited RD's doors did I take the first chance to throw the leftovers in the trash.  Should've just left it on the table...
