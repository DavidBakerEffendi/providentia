Yesterday I went to this location and the experience was horrible. I had missing food and the 2 banana puddings I ordered was terrible. To much pudding, one waffer in both and 2 bananas in each container. I called the store manager when I notice my food was missing. He wasn't friendly. He said to me: What do you want me to do? (It was the way he said it, that wasn't friendly) I told him to give me a credit. I spoke to Kosta (manager) he said write his name on my receipt and bring the receipt back when I am ready to redeem my free platter. Showmars always have a lot of servers working and they need to double check the orders before given them out. Next time I want assume that there doing there job correctly. I will make sure I check my order!
