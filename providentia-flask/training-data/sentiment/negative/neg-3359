Would have been good if my meat was cooked. My boyfriend and I thought it was mushy cause all the sauce and stuff in it. Until I noticed it was pink inside. So we paid $20 for fries basically. Well $24 including tip. Wouldn't recommend. It was a cool place they had games and stuff. But just not a cooked meal. Make sure the meat is cooked before eating.
