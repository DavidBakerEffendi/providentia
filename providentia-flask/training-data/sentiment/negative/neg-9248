I was craving some Tom Kha (with chicken) the other day cause I wasn't feeling good and thought soup would make me feel better so I decided to give this place a try and order for delivery since its so close to my house. The lady that I talked to didn't speak any good English at all, I had to tell her my address so many times and i told her what I ordered I made it so clearly. 
Anyways, the delivery was really fast but when I started to check my food and was about to take a big ass sip on my soup I see a freakin shrimp umm I'm allergic to shrimp like I almost ate that thing! I called them back and this time it was a guy and I told him that they messed up my order and he wasn't really nice about it and I told him to get it right and send me the right one. After 45 minutes later of waiting he finally came and got the order right but I felt very skeptic to even eat my soup cause they seem very shady but I ate it anyway and now I'm sick. Thanks a lot for the bad service,workers there cant even speak english, your food sucks and won't be ordering at this shady place ever again!
