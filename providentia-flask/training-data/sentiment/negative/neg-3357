Normally I think this place is ok. I don't think you should not go here because of this review. However, it is important to know what you can expect. If something is 86ed there is no apology and no manager visit. I don't expect that a servers attitude should be poor after telling you they don't have something that You ordered. The server actually said "seriously" to me after after I questioned the issue. 

Mistakes can happen and will happen I get that!! This is why the recovery is so important you could have fixed this whole thing with a simple I'm sorry. 

Here is my bacon pic below

The bacon is over cooked 
The hash browns are cold 
The eggs are runny and I asked for them well done
Toast perfect
