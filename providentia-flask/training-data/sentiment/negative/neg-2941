A coworker and I had to run some errands in the adjacent strip mall so figured we'd stop by Pepe's for lunch. Unfortunately, that was a huge mistake.

We got the chicken quesadilla combo and a carne asada burrito. First off, "combo" just means a drink is supposed to be included; it doesn't come with rice or beans or sides. Worse yet, the quesadilla managed to be both bland and really, really greasy, which seems like a cardinal sin. The burrito was also lousy - it was more like really dry ground beef than carne asada. It was small, too, making the value proposition quite suspect.

And there's a reason I said that the combo means a drink is "supposed" to be included; after I got my CC receipt, I noticed they'd charged us for an extra drink. The same lady who processed my order refused to credit the CC and wanted to pay me back in cash instead, but when she gave me cash she only gave me back the menu price of the drink (without the sales tax, which they charged). I had to talk to another person to get them to understand that they also owed me the sales tax.

I can't shake the feeling that this wasn't a mistake, since I never asked for a drink in the first place (since it was supposed to have been included in my combo); they just arbitrarily charged me for one. Also, not a single person apologized during this whole interaction.

Finally, they charge $.50 to use a CC. Bad value proposition, lousy food, shady cashiers, and still nickel+diming us on top of all that? No thanks.
