Most terrible dining experience of my existence. 

First of all, it was a total sensory overload. They had a moving playing, music blaring, and then the sound of traffic (which is admittedly unavoidable). 

Now to the heart of the matter: the food. 
The ribs were at least 50% fat. The curly fries were bland, greasy, soggy, and unpalatable. And the portions! If you want a ridiculously large amount of food, this is the place for you but I thought it was disgusting and so unhealthy, not that I was expecting much nutritional value. 

I will never go there again and I strongly advise that you just avoid it.
