Went to check this place out due to the awesome reviews......well. I ordered a standard eggs benny. I asked for my eggs to be poached hard and they were runny. Along with the runny eggs was a lukewarm barely toasted English muffin and cold flavorless hash browns. I wouldn't necessarily call this a good experience.
