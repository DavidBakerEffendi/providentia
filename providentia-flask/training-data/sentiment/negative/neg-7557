went there around 2:30pm, server with some attitude with no patient when placing order and asking questions about the menu (they only have 4 tables with customers and they have 4 servers on the floor).
"Like" them on FB for free upgrade iced drinks no longer available, and they still have the promotion printed on their main menu.
for their signature dish, served with a tiny end cut piece of corn and the cauliflower tasted weird and it's SOUR. did not eat that at all.  Reported to the same server, she said she would report to the owner, but of coz she didn't.....she was within the dining room area before I paid for the bill.
Don't think their business will last long.

Suggestion to the owner:
work on your food portions, and have your servers trained properly.
