My parents were raving about this place so when they asked us to go with them we gladly did.  The first experience was decent, however lacked certain things like prompt refills.  I was a server myself, so I judge more harshly on service. I let this slide due to the fact they were a little busy. The food was amazing especially for a $5.99 all you can eat special!  A couple weeks go by and my parents want to go back again.. we say of course! 
We entered the restaurant around 7:30 pm on a Tuesday,  there were 4 current tables and a bunch of dirty ones.. must have just missed the rush!  Still standing at the door for 5 minutes, we're finally greeted and seated. Sat for another 5-7 minutes and the server finally comes over. We order drinks and place our orders.  Fifteen minutes later another table was seated near us. We still have not received any food. not even plates for our bread that we had asked for. where are our salads! ? Same server grabs that table.. she takes their order and they immediately get bread and salads!  She then comes to our table and asks what we ordered again,  meaning she hadn't even put out order in and we had been there for 45 minutes!  The food is good but the service is terrible!  We got up and left!  We won't be returning.
