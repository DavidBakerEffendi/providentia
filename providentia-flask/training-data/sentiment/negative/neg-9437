I have been here more times than I would have liked. It is such a nice venue, but consistently the poorest service and over priced food.   It takes 20 mins to get a drink and it seems like there are waiters standing around everywhere and yet no one is attending to you.  I have never been there once without having to get up from my table and ask for a waiter.   The food, once you get it is OK but not worth the price they charge.  It's so sad.  We kept going back because we love the island, but not sure I can justify it anymore.  I assume they survive on tourists who don't know the difference and people who just don't mind sitting for hours.   If u do go, and have a few hours and a few hundred bucks and lots of patience, order the hummus and the bison burger.
