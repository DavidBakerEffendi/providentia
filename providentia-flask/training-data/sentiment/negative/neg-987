Never received a worst delivery in my life. The delivery girl began by calling and wasting my time asking me to explain to her where I was in my complex even though I gave them a building number and there is a map at the front. Not to mention they were already really late. She gave me my food without much said and left quickly. My food was drenched in soup from a broken container, my ice cream melted, and my food cold. I tried to eat what I could salvage, but the food is terrible to boot.
