Last night we felt like fish and chicken again and I have always liked LJS' food.  But not this location -- my previous review expresses my sentiment about this location, and if you look at others' recent reviews, you can see where others agree with me.  But this update is being written because I went all the way to the Power Road location since I did want LJS fish and chicken.  I printed out two Corporate coupons from the LJS website and took them with me.  The Power Rd location let me use them and when I asked why the Market Street location would not let me used them previously, I was told that maybe that franchisee didn't want to allow the discounts.  So this confirms my suspicion about this place.  BTW, the service was good and efficient, and so was the food at the Power Road location.  The food was perfectly fried and the frying oil was fresh because I can taste it if the oil is old.  So I was a happy camper.
