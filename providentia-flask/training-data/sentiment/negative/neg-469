I went here yesterday and it was nothing like the Dos Gringos on Priest.  You can tell the Manager at this location is lazy and doesn't really care about the location at all.  There were 4 dogs on the patio barking.  There were children running around with cell phones as their parents were drinking, and the service was crap.  Bad location.  Go to the one on Priest.
