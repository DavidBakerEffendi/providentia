This was absolutely the WORST burrito I've ever had EVER!!  I ordered the ground beef burrito for takeout and it was the old "where's the beef" problem.  Hardly any ground beef and mostly refried beans or something with massive amounts of the tortilla.  It was gross!!  I only had a couple of bites because it tasted that bad and the small amount I did eat upset my stomach and I know that was the problem because that's all I had to eat that day.  I should have listened to the server because she tried to talk me into the steak burrito but, no, I didn't listen.  Also, the look on her face when I chose the ground beef should have been a hint as well.  Hello!  I will say the rice was okay.  Enough said.
