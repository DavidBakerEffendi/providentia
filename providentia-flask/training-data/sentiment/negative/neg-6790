Just gross. I ordered shrimp with lobster sauce and crab rangoons. What I got wass a sloppy sorry excuse for lobster sauce that tasted re-heated and pre-packaged, and the crab rangoons I'm positive were store bought. Nothing about this place felt or tasted remotely authentic. For the same price you can travel down the road a block to China-a-go-go and see your food getting prepared by actual Chinese chefs and pay not a dollar more. The quality, variety, and service trump this place hands down. Save yourself a trip to the bathroom with an upset stomach (trust me, you will probably get sick like I did) and just don't go here.
