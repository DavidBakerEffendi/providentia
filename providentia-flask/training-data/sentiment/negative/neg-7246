Tonight, June/18/2017, I called and ordered some food for pick up -  a black tea crushed iced desert and pork cutlet over rice meal.   When I when to pick it up, a girl collected payment and gave me my order.

I brought home the order - I only live 5 min from the restaurant - and found my crushed iced desert all melted.   It was completely ruined and I had to throw it away.

The employee who packed the order did not have the sense and care to pack the cold iced desert and hot meal order separately.  It demonstrated an obvious lack of care for the customer. 

What is ironic is that I gave this employee, a gal at the cash register, a tip, even though it was a pick up order.   


What a disappointment!!!   


Next time, I am going to drive a few blocks and go to Chatime or Sugar Marmalade.
