If I could give zero stars I would. I came here today for lunch with my sister and mom who is visiting from Florida. Our waitress was good but the food took forever to come out even though the place was empty. The food was alright except for my sisters food. The chicken was terrible. It looked like yesterday's chicken that had been reheated in the microwave. It was brown inside. Awful. The manager brought her food out the second time and ducked out of here like the place was on fire when she said it was still microwaved. This was terrible. The wall against the table was crusty with old food. 0/10 would not recommend and definitely will not come here again.
