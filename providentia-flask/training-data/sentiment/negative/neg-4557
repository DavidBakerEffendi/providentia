1 hour wait!!!? And we were still six orders away! Ridiculous wait! How hard is it to throw fish in a fryer!!?? But drive thru was going fast. Whoever owns this business needs to figure out how to run a business cause they're focusing too much on drive threw. They act like they're making gourmet food. There were staff just walking back and forth with food just sitting there over the fryer with a ton of orders to go!?  No way! Don't waste your time
