Came here with a Groupon ($29 for two for tappas buffet) First of all they need to look up what tappas are as the picture is very misleading. Might as well have eaten at McDonald's. They had pizza, fries, chicken balls which literally tasted like McDonald's chicken mcnuggets. WOULD NOT RETURN. 

Pros
All you can eat

Cons 
-Limited food. We literally had to wait for the waiter to bring out more food every 5 min because there was nothing left
-NO TAPPAS (all they had was pizza, chicken balls, fries and some cold cut salami) 
Food was bland. 

For $30 go to Chipotle across the street and have yourself a feast. Don't waste your time here.
