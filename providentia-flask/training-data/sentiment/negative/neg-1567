Worst experience ever! Myself and my husband went here for dinner with my parents and adult son after our wedding to celebrate. When we checked in we were told that it would be a thirty minute wait so we took a seat at the bar and ordered the monster platter as an appetizer. After an hour we got our seats and ordered our dinners and after an hour and a half we finally got our appetizers. At this point I had my sister and her family and my brother and his girlfriend and a close friend and her husband waiting to meet us at yard house for drinks. I asked to speak to a  manager and told him the situation and asked if he could put some tables together in the almost empty restraunt so my guests could sit with us. After an hour of him not getting back to me and after over 2 hours of waiting I had to get my server and tell him that if we didn't have the check for the drinks and appetizers in 2 minutes we were walking out. So there we all were almost 9pm haven't eaten since early morning because we were getting ready for the wedding we walked over to yard house were seated right away and drinks and food came very fast. Moral of the story if you want to get drunk go to saddle ranch if you want to eat and have a nice experience go elsewhere. Thanks for the memorable time guys SMH.
