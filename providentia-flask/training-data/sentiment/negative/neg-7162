Truly awful food at this place. Hate to provide such a negative review but prompted to do so so others don't make the same mistake as we did.

My wife and I responded to a lunch deal we received on our phones. We had never been to this restaurant and thought we would give it a try. Wife had French Dip with fries. Hoagie roll was stale and tasted like very cheap white, pasty bread. Nothing like a true French Baquette. Broth dip for sandwhich was extremely salty. Tasted like they mixed beef boullion with water. Meat was nothing to brag about. rather flavorless. Fries were terrible, fake, extruded fries not real french fries.

I ordered the Burger and requested a side salad instead of carb heavy potato chips or french fries (only side choices). They want extra two dollars to sub out a side salad.  Rip off and not too friendly to health conscious consumers. I opted for the chips thinking they would be house made. Wrong. Chips from a bag. I only ate a few. The burger was from a frozen patty. Tasteless! Not worth the price they are charging. 

For an appetizer we ordered their pretzel. Bad decision. Bready, soft consistency. Not pretzel like at all. Waste of money.  $8.95.  Way over priced. With $15 off for the coupon we still ended up paying over $35 for lunch.

Won't be going back. Skip this place if you have any tastebuds. You won't be satisfied.
