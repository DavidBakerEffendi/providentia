First, they came for the calamari, but I did not say anything because they were out of calamari. Then they came for the zucchini, and again I remained silent, as they were out of zucchini also. It was 6 pm on Friday.

I write this review ironically as this place will no longer be in business by the time anyone reads this.

Get the chicken parmigiana. Enjoy your one shriveled piece of chicken breast. It's extra good because they don't bother with that pesky mozzarella cheese on top, which is always a bummer. Please, pay $19 for ravioli from the freezer. The mussels? Better get two orders because there are about 6 mussels per order.

The owners were sitting right next to us and were sure to get us our check before offering dessert because we dare to be unimpressed with their garbage. I'd say don't bother coming, but it won't be here if you try.
