Well let me start this off by saying I am from South West Louisiana, and have a HUGE Cajun family.  I have spent much of my life eating and visit New Orleans, and most of the creole and Cajun areas of the south.  This was by far one of the worst experiences I have ever had eating.  It took hour upon hours to get food, no one at the table got food at the same time either.  The gumbo was VERY thin and watery with ONE and I mean ONE shrimp in it, the crawfish had zero seasoning on them no corn and HUGE russet potatoes that were not cooked, the red beans and rice were not cooked, in fact the beans were still basicially hard and raw.  I asked for hot sauce and they asked was it not spicy enough for me???  Well no it was not considering there was NO spice in anything at all. There is one person running the place and cooking and he is not very nice.  The restaurant is extremely dirty and I an not sure how it has not been shut down by health inspectors. In the time it took to get our food I could have driven to Louisiana, eaten there and drove back to Ohio.  I am not sure who wrote the other reviews but I will assume they are from the people who work there...
