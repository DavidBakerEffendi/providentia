Over priced, it is the modern day version of what surely constitutes a Roman gastronomic orgy. Fit for a fat emperor and his swarthy court, I really was nauseated by the amount of food and consumption going on here. 
Like stations of the cross, you drag yourself and your plate to the next one for crepes, or omelettes, or fruit or meats or porridge or danishes oh my, just going over it in my head  makes me feel 10 lbs heavier.
We came here because we were given Bfast here with our stay at the Bellagio. But had I had to pay, wait in the Disneyland-like cue and then be seated in the arena of food I would not could not step foot in here. 
Best go have a well prepared, custom ordered omelette at any cafe or resto in the Bellagio and do your heart and hips a favor steer clear of here.
