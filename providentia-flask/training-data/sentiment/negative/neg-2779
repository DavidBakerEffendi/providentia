Probably the worst McDonalds ever. I go here because it's close but would definetely avoid it if I had other options. Service is incredibly slow. One time they even ran out of eggs during breakfast so I couldn't order an egg mcmuffin lol. Today I went in and tried to redeem one of those coffee cards for a Frape. They denied my request even though EVERY single Mcdonalds has allowed me to get a Frape for one of those coffee cards (afterall, it IS the same price as their specialty beverages...even less $$). The manager was extremely rude. I ordered a medium coffee with 1 cream and 1 sugar...they gave me a large with SO much sugar in it...I didnt notice this until I was half way home /my coffee had cooled down for me to take a sip. Overall, worst Mcdonalds ever.
