I have eaten here many times and is one of my favorite places but the service I got yesterday 7/17 at 4pm by the young lady behind the counter was horrendous!  She took my order like it was an inconvenience, then when my food came out I asked for a sharp knife ( which are usually out with butter knives with other silverware) to cut my kabobs, she pointed at the silverware and I told her only butter knives were out and her response was "its cuts the same" with an attitude, and acted all put out to go see if any of the usual sharper knives were clean.  I was so furious I almost left right then without eating my food.  I sarcastically said I didn't mean to put you out and her response was basically  " that's ok" like it was my fault.  

I requested a call from the owner by email submission to their website but nothing.  I will eat there again but this young lady is awful!!!!!
