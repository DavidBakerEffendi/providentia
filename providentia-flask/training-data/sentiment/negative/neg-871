I have long been in search for a chinese delivery place that can do a good mu-shu. I typically order from New China Gate, great food but mu-shu is not an option. When I got a menu for this place in my mail box I thought "let's give it go." Bad idea. The mu-shu was bland and had a bad texture. We also ordered the crab rangoon, they were awful, very thin and the little bit of filling they did have was overcooked and rubbery. The sweet and sour sauce even had a weird flavor. I'll stick with New Chine gate, but if your are reading this please make a mu-shu,
