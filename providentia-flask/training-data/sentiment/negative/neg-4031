Used to come here very often as i love their chickens wings and their prices are good. But recently their food quality has gone downhill as their bussiness has increased. U can get general tsao chicken on time and it'll be red and taste greate and crisp the next day you go it'll be orange and soggy lacking flavour or texture. Same with their fried rice it just tastes like moth balls lately, like its old or the rice hadn't been washed. 
Customer service here is horrible as the only two employees they have their look overwhelmed and irrate. Very snippy and the girl at the front desk acts like shes sleep deprived anytime u call to place to order it's as if u are annoying her by makin her wake up. Chicken wings are still good but after my last few experiences i refuse to come back here for the quality and service...
