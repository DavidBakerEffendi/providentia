I stopped by here two Sundays ago for dinner with 6 of my friends.  Many of us have eaten at the Bellagio buffet in the past and before the trip I think I would have called it my favorite buffet on the strip.  The selections on this buffet were the normal good stuff with peppercorn crusted steak, king crab legs, crab claws, whole roasted pig and others.  Sadly they didn't have any beef Wellington on this evening which was one of my favorite things here in the past.  My first trip up consisted mostly of steak and other meats and I really enjoyed it.  Then my second trip up I went for both the crab legs and crab claws.  Upon getting back to my seat i found the king crab legs to be somewhat frozen (aka you would get some ice in the bites but they were edible) and the crab claws were completely frozen.  So I asked to speak to a manager and told him my concerns.  I was polite and wasn't asking for a handout and he told me that sometimes the claws on the other side of the buffet were better and he would get me some.  Fair enough.  So I headed back to my seat and a minute of two later he came back with some claws.  I touched one and felt the iciness of it and told him they were frozen.  He proceeded to crack a claw, water going everywhere including on his suit, and told me they weren't frozen.  I looked into the claw to see a slushy mixture that was clearly still half frozen.  What could I do though - get in a pissing match with the manager?  So he ended up leaving without a resolution and the crab claws would all get taken away without any being eaten.

The bottom line for me is that I don't think I will be heading back to this buffet.  While our server was good, the buffet seems to have lost some of its luster and I wasn't a fan of the manager.
