Tonight I had a disappointing experience at metro pizza.  At 5:20pm I order a chicken Parmesan sub for pick up. They told me it would take about 25 minutes. I showed up at 5:45pm and paid. They told me about 2 more minutes. 15 minutes later I asked where my food was. The girl went back to check and came back with my food. It took 40 minutes for 1 sub sandwich. Very frustrating! Not to mention the food was also disappointing. The chicken on the sub was over cooked and barely any sauce on the sandwich making it very dry. The bread wasn't very fresh either. And the girls at the pick up counter were not very friendly.  Needless to say I don't need to rush back there any time soon.
