Not good. Maybe we've been spoiled by the spectacular Indian buffet in Niles, OH. This was so disappointing. Selection was sparse, salad wilted. Food that was there was only ok. Naan was burned and when gone no more was brought. 
Staff mostly absent and unfriendly. 
Overall very sad. Not sure where the good reviews came from. 
Find somewhere else to go.
