I call these people and they never answer. They let it ring and ring then it goes to busy. They don't have a pay cash option which is beyond unacceptable. If I have money in hand why can you not take it as payment? They only accept plastic for call in orders. Literally the only restaurant I know that does this. Very sad. I've had my ID stolen by places like this. I'm not trusting them with my card all the time. But hey if they don't want the cash it is on them. Several times they messed my order up but I don't say anything because humans make mistakes. If switching to only debit cards is because they don't trust their customers to pay then why order when I can't trust them to make a salad right?
