This is probably the worst Mexican restaurant that I have ever eaten. There wasn't any other restaurant that was open on New Years day and I was craving Mexican food. I saw this location so I wanted to try it. I ordered a chicken burrito with rice and beans on the side. The burrito along with the side were nasty. The chicken was really salty. The beans and rice tasted like they put a tub of salt. I couldn't eat it so I threw it away. Next time, I will just starve to death.
