Started out really great. I asked for a very well done pizza I made sure to tell more than one person so my order was correct.  Once I finally got my pizza it game out very underdone and extremely soggy. I could see this from just taking one look at my pizza. When I asked if they could cook my pizza more I was told "we don't do well done pizzas". Also they were very rude when I asked to talk to the manager about the situation. All together this was a terrible experience for me and I will NOT return... very disappointed.
