This place sucks. I have been here 3 times and ive actually only ate there once. The first time, I got an overpriced sandwich. The second time I ordered a meal that was a special, and they mispriced it; so I asked for a refund. Just now I went in and got something that was on their menu for $6.89, but was charged $7.39 because apparently "beef brisket" as stated on their menu does not mean "sliced" beef brisket. I asked for a refund and got an attitude. Fact is - these people flat out lie about their prices assuming you wont look at your receipt. Bunch of con artist, so I will keep my money and go to a more ethical place for lunch where I pay what the price says on the menu.
