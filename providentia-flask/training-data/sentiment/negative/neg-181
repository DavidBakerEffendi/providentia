Food: I really wanted to like the food here but it was very disappointing. I love meat jun, Kim Chee jun and every type of korean pancake. I eat a lot of it back home and I don't expect food in AZ to taste like home whatsoever but my meat jun and kimchee jun here was really bad. My kimchee+pork jun had zero pork in it. It was also extremely thick/dense and doughy. And the meat jun barely had any beef in it. I know meat jun has thin slices of beef in it to begin with but this was almost transparent--the slices were pounded so thin. I will say though that their ban chan was not bad. 

Atmosphere: Mom n Pop kind of place. 

Service: friendly but not helpful. After checking out my takeout order, I asked if my Kim Chee Jun had pork in it (like the menu says it comes with) bc I couldn't see any. The kind woman said yes (probably assuming/hoping it had some in there without checking with the kitchen) but when I took it home and ate it, I found NONE. 

Price: Disappointing after I didn't get the correct order.

I hate writing bad reviews for establishments, especially Mom n Pop kind of places, but food speaks for itself and my experience/food was just not good. Maybe it was just an off day for them.
