Gross and overpriced. The concept losses its appeal within 5 minutes. I ordered a burger and it was tasteless and the fries were cold. My draft was lukewarm and if you order water, they charge you
.75 for their stupid plastic cup. This restaurant is geared toward certain types of people; fortunately, I'm not one of them. Never to return. Over $70 for two gross entrees. That's criminal.
