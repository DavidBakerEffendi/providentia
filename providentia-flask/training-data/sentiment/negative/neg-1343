Sooo, we came back after several months and it was a disaster. 

We were seated inside, where it was hotter than Hades; outside it was a mild 73 degrees. But the kitchen heat was killing us, it must have been nearly 90+ inside. 

We waited and waited and waited and no one came by to greet us or take our drink order.  Around us, the owner was busing tables and things seemed disorganized. 

After ten+ minutes, we threw in our napkins and left.   I couldn't get over how much everything went down hill from our previous visit.  As we left, George the owner asked us why we were leaving. My wife told him and he just shrugged.  

I'm sorry. If you like extremely slow service and non-existence AC (what's that all about?) then this is your place. 

One Star, down from Four Stars. We had no problem finding a seat at Nick's just down the street and would also recommend Basil & Garlic.
