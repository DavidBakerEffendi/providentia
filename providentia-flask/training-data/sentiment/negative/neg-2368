As soon as you walk in the ambience warns you to leave immediately. But despite that we stayed because we bought a Groupon and wanted to try it out. The food was gross. They brought out a soup that was very salty with a burnt taste I don't know what it was supposed to be obviously the chef never tries the soup it was disgusting. The salad came out with what looks like dark applesauce plopped on the top of it. My five-year-old thought it was baby throw up. The actual cook at the table was pretty good I really enjoyed it but the food wasn't worth it total for four people, Groupon said it was $60 worth of food for four more people but our total was $95 with no alcohol. 

Service was good that waitress was very nice and prompts. I just think this place is way overpriced for the quality of its food and the Decour. The chair that I want to sit on had food from the previous table on it and the grill was caked with Greece it was spilling in between the countertop and the grill itself.

Lastly, they charge three dollars extra for each meal if you want fried rice. They even charge the three dollar fee for a child's menu to get fried rice. Outrageous!
