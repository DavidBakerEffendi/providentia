The service was awful we had to argue with the waitress to even split the check. everything is hella overpriced compared to how it is priced in the menu. This is exactly why I don't come to saddle ranch anymore. why pay outrageous prices for crap beer when I can pay the same amount and the beer is of much higher quality and more unique selection in downtown Glendale (OTG or Hause Murphy) or in downtown Phoenix (Angels Trumpet). At least at those establishments they are grateful for you spending your money at those bars.
