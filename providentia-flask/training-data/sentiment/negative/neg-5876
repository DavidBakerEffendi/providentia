VERY unsatisfied with this last visit. I been here many times before and nver seen this type of treatment especially from the GM manager himself Chris T. We came in on a Monday night and he didn't acknowledge our presence... usually when customers walk in the right thing to do is to grret them. He turned his back on is and kept wiping the me us as we didn't exist. Then we proceeded to go outside, picked our own table and just sat down. My bf asked me where the bathroom was and I showed him with my hand gesture where it is and Chris was standing behind my bf the whole time making this ugly face like why did u guys walk in??? Then Chris proceeds to ask me what my bf wanted and then said what he didn't believe you? mmm Noooo it's actually your job to greet people and show them where the bathroom is. Chris gave us the menus without greeting us just threw them down on the table and walked away. A sweet blonde waitress came up and asked us for drinks and we asked her who the douch bag is... she rolled her eyes and said her GM... Well this GM needs to go back to school and learn how to provide customer service to people because obviously being an ass doesn't cut it. He needs to be fired if he really treats people this way!!! There is sooo much more to this story but Yelp will run out of room in this review! FIRE THE DOUCH CHRIS T. THE GM!!!
