Save your money!
Bought a $29 Groupon for Gel nails & pedicure $60 value I paid more for the French tip but none of it was worth it. 
Had to book 3 weeks in advance. 
The tech was friendly.
The pedicure itself was good but the seating for the pedicure is awful and uncomfortable.
The gel nails chipped the next day.
They tried to fix them by painting over them.   They believed they were doing me a favor, I still tipped. 2 days later they started chipping again.
I don't recommend this place even with the deals.
