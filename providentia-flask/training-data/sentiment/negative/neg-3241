I don't understand what the whole rave is about. If burritos were like this nobody would ever eat them. There are so many other places in the city which are much much better! Chipotle or makes much better burritos. So does Burrito Boys and big fat bastard burrito.  Pretty much any other burrito place trumps this hole in the wall.
