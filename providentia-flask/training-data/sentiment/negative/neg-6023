Had brunch this past weekend. all i can say is come on Bellagio. I was very disappointed with the quality/selection of the food. Just like the previous reviewer, 1 hour and 15 minutes in line- not worth it at all. Brunch was $25, which is pretty good deal, but pay 5-7 more and go to Wicked spoon at Cosmopolitan. you wont be disappointed.
