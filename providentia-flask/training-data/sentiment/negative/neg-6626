I normally stay away from fast food lunches if I can help it, but I had a coupon for a free sandwich, so I thought I'd indulge.

Nope, not this one. The guy at the counter says the code on my coupon was not the right one, like I had gotten the bonus question wrong on the big test. I wrote down the code I was given. He was very unclear on the specifics. It was like he just didn't want to honor it. He said they do honor them, but the code I had didn't have the date. The date was on the front. He then said it was the wrong code. OK, I'm in the wrong place, see ya!

This BK is always smelly and there always transients loitering and smoking just outside anyway.  The bad thing is that often this is the only place open to eat early in the morning or late at night.

Bad service and smelly restaurant equals disaster.
