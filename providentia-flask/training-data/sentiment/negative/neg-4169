Went in a few nights ago. Food and staff was average. The restaurant however is a mess. The tile around salsa bar is dirty and chipped,windows dirty, dusty and sign printed out and stuck on wall. The restaurant to me looks like it's been written off. It's in a hidden location. If the front end looks that bad, I would hate to see the back. Very disappointing to see a good brand let a unit get that disheveled.
