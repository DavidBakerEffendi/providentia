Slow service and bad food! When I heard about this place I was so excited to try it cuz I totally missed good Asian bakery. I was there yesterday and ordered black pepper beef sandwich and they told me they were out of beef. Then I asked if they had curry buns they told they didn't make them anymore. Then I decided to order teriyaki chicken sandwich and it was too salty. I also bought coconut buns and it tasted old and stale. Their milk tea was so chalky and nasty. It kinda made me sick & nauseous after taking few sips I tossed it out. Every freaking thing I ordered was pretty bad and gross. Never going back to that place again.
