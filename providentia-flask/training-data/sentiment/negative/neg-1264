Decided to try something everyone wasn't raving about since everyone was saying their food was so good. Apparently no one tried the Mac and cheese. It was bland and could probably feed about 3 people. Way too huge for lunch. There were bread crumbs on top that could've been omitted and I think it could've used some salt. Will probably not be coming here again.  Plus who likes eating in a corner store/ car wash with limited seating.
