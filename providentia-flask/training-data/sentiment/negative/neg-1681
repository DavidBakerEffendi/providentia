it's a different kind of pizza place. we dinned in and had to watch India tv in Spanish.  The special we ordered came in to -go boxes.salad was ok.Blue cheese dressing was good .The garlic balls had no garlic on them.plenty of butter though .Pizza crust is more like bread,toppings were ok.Not a place I will go back to though
