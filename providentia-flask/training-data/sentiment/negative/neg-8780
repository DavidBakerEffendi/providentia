I visited this place again today and oh such a disaster! When we entered there was no one at the front of the house. After calling them they confirmed that they were open. The elderly uncle who serves here was eating. He gave us water without washing his hands?!!

Unfortunately that was not even the worst part. He suggested us to order the chicken tikka kebabs. They were horrible. I am pretty sure they were at least a day old. The chutney that they served with it looked as if it was kept open since a long time as it had dried up!!! The plate was really shabby. We asked him if they were stale to which he said no. The biryani was fine. But somehow we had lost our appetite after the first bite of the tikka. I am pretty sure they had microwaved an old batch.
While we were there two more people came to eat and left after waiting to get seated. When we complained about the food he just said the oven takes a long time to heat up and they had a catering order. Well I don't care. It's so unfair for people to get such a service for their money. 

The saddest part is he didn't seem bothered at all. It's was almost like he didn't care about the restaurant or his customers. I have vowed NEVER to go back here. It has been THE worst experience I have had in a restaurant. It was really disappointing after our first experience here. I take back my words..Save yourself a nightmare and avoid this place.
