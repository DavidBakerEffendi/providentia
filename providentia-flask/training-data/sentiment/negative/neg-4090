1.  I ask for Ong Choi with Beef, waiter said "its extra $2 if you want beef"; I said "ok".  The dish come out without the beef......and when I asked where is the beef, the waiter got mad....
2.  The restaurant is very dirty, compare to the Sam Woo in Irvine, CA
3.  Service was bad
4.  Don't waste your money here
