I really don't care for a fly with my fries. But I got it anyway. Thx to McDonald's . Wish I saw it before I ate that much of the fries . I should have known better to eat there. When I walked in at 1 pm there was not many people there but not a single table was clean . That should have told me something. Lesson learned. Next time
