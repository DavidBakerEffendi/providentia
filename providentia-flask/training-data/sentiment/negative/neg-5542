This place USED to be our favorite place. The last few times have just gotten progressively worse. (One time we got there before they supposedly closed but they decided to close early and Another time, they changed their hours) the cleanliness is suspect. There was a time we came here and were sat at a dirty, sticky table. This place has also been shut down multiple times for many offenses by the health department. 

This time, we thought we might give this place one more shot. We walked in the door hoping for a good experience. We noticed that The sauces are no longer in the squeeze bottles, they are in little glass containers with plastic spoons in them. I find this one of the most unsanitary "new" things that they started to do. We don't know how other people used it. What if they licked the spoon, or set it on the dirty table and then put it back in the jar? They used to offer hot tea for free, but now they charge $2.50 for it. When the "hot" tea arrived at the table, it was cold. The bowl of pho came and it barely had any actual pho (noodles!). There was no cilantro, and the broth was watery. What a waste. Will not be coming here again.
