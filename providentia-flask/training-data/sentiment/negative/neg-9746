We heard great reviews about this place.  We decided to go for dinner with a group of 5. We expected the wait, however, when we were seated, we were sat at the bar.   If we did not want those seats it would have been at least another 1/2 hour.  So we decided to sit there (this was supposed to be our family Easter dinner).  Once seated we ordered, we were not able to add or omit anything from the dishes we had ordered.   Our girls wanted garlic added to pizza and they wouldn't do it.  Another person in our party couldn't have cheese and they refused to omit it from the risotto.  Finally, my dinner selection was a pork chop that was on special.  They ended up running out of the pork chop and wanted to replace it with a pork belly (with the skin left on).  Needless to say, we ended up going without dinner as we canceled the entire order and left. I would definitely not recommend this place.
