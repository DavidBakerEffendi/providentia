Came here for lunch and it was horrible. Got a steak sandwich which I was told was "lean" but that usually means the meat is lean, not the portion size. When I pay for a steak sandwich I expect to get more than one thin slice! Also tried the mushroom soup. I was hoping it wasn't Campbells but after tasting how watered down it was I think Campbell's out of a can would taste better! Not returning and don't recommend!!
