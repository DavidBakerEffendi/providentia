Rude!  I didn't bother to stay for the food. Why would I?  Apparently when I made a reservation for one that didn't get me a table, it only (barely) allowed me the right to sit on one of their bars tools. 
They refused to seat me at a table, even with a reservation, because I was 'only a party of one'. I am in town for Work--sometimes that happens. 

And I saw at least one table that had an individual gentleman on his own. So what was the real issue?  An absolute lack of manners, courtesy, or business sense!  Their food didn't smell nearly good enough to deal with the rudeness & chauvinism.
