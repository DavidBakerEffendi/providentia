Being in the terrace with misters to cool you off, overlooking the big pool is quite nice. Sitting under the nice umbrellas for shades is pretty but the birds to pee and poop on you while you are eating is disgusting. There are quite a lot of birds who are waiting to eat your leftover means they eat there, they poop there. 

The food we ordered are very disappointing. Asian Chicken salad is mixed with old frozen and thawed cheap chicken breast. Its gamey and it doesn't taste like chicken at all. It's horrendous. I bet it's a gmo chicken. The fish tacos are bland and dry. I don't wonder why there are so many birds there because they enjoy the food!! We did not finish our food and just left. For a big nice casino like Wynn, the cafe food we ordered are a big disappointment.
