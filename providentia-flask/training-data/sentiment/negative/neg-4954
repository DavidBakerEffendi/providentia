When I got there the bartender gave me a glass and my bill, but no beer. I waited 10-15  minutes to get my beer. Which was stiffly overpriced. If you leave a respectible tip, you're paying 5x gas station prices for Sapporo. I shrugged that off, I was there for a friends birthday and to have fun.

The place over charged me for my sushi, I didn't realize until later that they charged me $1.50 more than what was in the menu for my food. Sure it's not much, but to add it to the fact it took so long for them to get us our sushi we were about to leave when they finally brought it to us. We received our sushi a half hour after the habachi people were done eating. That was the last time I will be going there. Used to be my favorite place, but after 2 times and it the service being completely disappointing, I will never ever ever go back.
