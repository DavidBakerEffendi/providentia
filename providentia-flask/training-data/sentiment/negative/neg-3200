The food quality has gone down over the years, but they have taken on a new low. We ordered the Cesar salad. It was drenched in dressing and the romaine was limp and old, which was evident from the red pieces. The prosciutto pizza with artichoke is what has kept us returning, but even that was a disappointment. The pizza came out stiff and cracked in pieces because it was so dry. The server had the nerve to act like it was fine, stating they now roll out the dough thinner. We had them remake the pizza, which made it edible, but it was not enjoyable like before. We did enjoy the sliders, earning the 1 star. We watched as our server bussed a table, dropping glass on the floor. We were appalled that none of his coworkers came by to help, especially considering the hazard it posed. This place attracts a lot of families with small children because of the cotton candy and messy sundae. Parents beware... When the bill arrived for over $30 it just added to the pain of our visit. We couldn't wait to get out of here!
