Was here last Saturday night before going to see carrot top at the luxor on the 23rd.  We wanted a table and our two options were sit with another group or sit at the bar when there were plenty of tables open.  So we choose to sit at the bar.  Waiting at the bar we could tell we were the last of their worries and we left and found somewhere else to eat.  I contacted them and they don't seem to care about the negative experience I had there so be warned.....
