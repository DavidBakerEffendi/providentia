Absolutely disappointed. Got delivery from postmates. Had multiple missing items and everything I got was absolutely disgraceful or wrong. Got a half BBQ chicken and received one chicken breast got a side Cesar salad and got honey mustard dressing. Well who eats honey mustard on a Cesar salad? I dint ask for that!!! Ordered two cheesecake and only received one. And the one that I got tastes like it's been in the fridge for over a month. Very unprofessional. Will never order from this place again nor recommend it!!! Oh and I have the pics attached for the people that don't believe. Did I mention the salad was half rotted. Y'all trying to kill me?!!!! I'm very angry and don't know if I should go off on duckworths or postmates. Might as well have packed me a bag of dookie. After working a 12 hour long day and you decide to treat your to a lavish dinner, and you get this? It's like I'm on a prank show to see how mad people can make me.
