Yuki-more like yucky.  Sorry-that's childish of me.  I had to. 

My dad had been there a few times on his own and highly reccommended it to me and hubs so we went.  We had a combo there that combined a sushi boat, tempura and a korean rice dish.  All very decent-sushi/sashimi probably better than Seoul House across the street.

So we finish our side dishes and when we asked to have them refilled, the waitress told us that the refill on kimchi would cost extra.  I kindly told her that refills should be complementary.  She said "No-you have to pay".  So I told her that when my dad goes there and speaks fluent Korean he never gets charged.  She gave me the dirtiest face I have ever seen in my life (seriously!) made an experasperated grunt and left. 

Another waitress came to refill ALL our side dishes and the other waitress was sent to other tables.  

So after this situation, the food didn't seem to taste as good as I remembered 20 minutes ago.  Never been back.  Never will be back.
