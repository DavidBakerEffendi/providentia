I generally love this place. Went in last night around 11pm with another friend. 3 woman bartenders. Maybe 30 people in this place. My girlfriend and I stood at the bar for 15 minutes and watched while the woman bartenders waited on all the men. No one even made eye contact with us. The "new" manager was standing out when we left. Told us to have a good night and I told him exactly what had happened he said "I'll talk to them" NOT please come back in and I will get you a drink. Horrible customer service if you aren't a guy.
