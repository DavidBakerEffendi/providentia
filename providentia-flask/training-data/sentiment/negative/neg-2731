Came here for breakfast, very unfriendly welcome from the staff, very unprofessional set up,mediocre quality and portions, but above all, very expensive $15 for a thin lox bagel without coffee, when at Station Casinos breakfast is under $10 everything included? Never again...Actually, they deserve 0 stars, not even one.
