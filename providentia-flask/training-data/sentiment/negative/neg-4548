Yikes- I really don't see this place lasting much longer with all the other great places in the area!  It's getting 1 star for decor/ambiance/location.  I should have checked the yelp reviews prior ugh.  Stopped by for lunch today with my husband. The place was about half full.  Nothing on the menu really caught my eye (sign #1 we should have just left), the waitress was very attentive but when it came time to order, she informed us that about half the menu was unavailable bc they were in the process of redoing it (sign #2 we should have just left, would have been nice to know when we sat down), ok, needed a few more minutes to decide what we were going to have instead, we decided on a fondue and pretzel app and to split a Rueben sandwich.  She came back and when we ordered said 'oh wait we don't have the pretzel fondue either' ok soo we ordered jalape√±o poppers and a Rueben and my husband ordered a beer.  Our food ended up coming out at the same time (ok fine we didn't specify that we wanted the appetizer as an app) but my husband never got his beer.  We ate our food, bottom bread of the Rueben was soggy and the waffle fries were really oily, the poppers were really good.  When the check came the beer was included, the waitress was pretty upset that we never got the beer (she obviously didn't forget it, the bar did), it got that taken off.  

If this was my restaurant and I was in the middle of a huge menu re-do, I would have managers walking around all day to each table to talk to people, apologize, maybe talk about the new exciting things that will be on the new menu, maybe even offer some sort of free appetizer, something to get people to come back once the new menu was out.
