Overpriced pizza that is just OK. My first time here and we ordered pick up. When we got there they forgot the desert cookie we ordered, so we had to wait while they made it. The pizza was burnt and hard. And the cookie was even worse. Bad customer service also, the employees when we walked in were all sitting around a pizza eating. Probably why they forgot our cookie, than rushed and burnt it when they forgot. First and LAST time there. If you want a personal pizza go to BLAZE.
