WOW...  this place has horrible customer service!

I will not return here.  Tokyo Express was the place to go in Phoenix for Teriyaki Chicken years ago.  It has changed to a place that does not care about the food, customer or cleanliness.  Sad state that are in.

Why and how can you ruin a place like this?

Beware, In my opinion there are better places out there for Japanese Food.
