Where do I begin....I decided to give this place a try after stopping by the bank. Worst experience of my life. First off, I don't think the owners of this establishment know that they have competition on the same street. There are plenty of poke places I can go to, that are far better than this one. First off, what's with the attitude? It's my first time at this establishment. If I don't know what to get, at least help me out. Don't just point and walk away. Second, who in the world would pay for those portions especially when your competitors offer more. Third, if i want a new bowl cuz the salmon in my bowl tastes terrible, then try to fix the problem. Don't tell me I don't know what good fish taste like. I tasted rank fish. End of story. Anyway, don't give this place your business. They make a mockery of you if you have questions and they treat you like shit
