Sadly, this McDonald's makes a good case for why minimun wage shouldn't be raised. My boyfriend ordered a hamburger without pickels. When the cashier enter the order Into the register, she put cheeseburger. My boyfriend caught it and said, "No, a hamburger." The girl then proceeded to read our order back and read off a cheeseburger with no pickles. My boyfriend stopped her again and said, "Not a cheeseburger, a hamburger." Guess what we got when we received our order? A cheeseburger. 

Also, we paid $18 for our meal and we could have gone somewhere better for a lot less.
