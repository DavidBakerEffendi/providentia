Ordered delivery for the penne pasta and the delivery driver called 5 min later and said he had a family emergency and couldn't deliver any more which I can understand but then I called the store and the bartender who had taken our order didn't offer any other option to make sure we got our food or even tried to accomodate us even with a coupon she was pretty much like your shit out luck maybe it's cuz I called 40 min before closing but the customer service was horrible il never be ordering from them again considering I didn't even get to try their food. What a joke!
