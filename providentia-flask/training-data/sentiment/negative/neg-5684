My wife and I just ate there not 10 minutes ago. We enjoyed our meal, the food was good, and everything was delivered promptly. 
The problem came when I noticed a bug swimming in my beer. Keep in mind, we had already signed our check and were finishing our meal. I discreetly let an employee know and a "manager" came to talk with us. Instead of showing any concern, she argued that it was just a cluster of bubbles. WHAT DO YOU THINK MADE THE BUBBLES? She then wanted to filter the beer through a napkin to "test" what it was. THE LEGS WERE STILL MOVING! All of this was in front of other customers. 

In short: 
- we paid for our meal
- the food was good
- INSPECT YOUR FOOD OR DRINK!
