Service was horrendous. Had one drink in over an hour. Food took forever and instead of waiting for an entree we left and ordered pizza instead. If you have the bleached blonde waitress turn around and leave. Not worth the waste of time. The order of wings we had was actually good but the place was not near busy enough to justify the complete failure of the wait staff.
