Oh my! What a ripoff! 

I went to Sugar Factory with my friend mostly to try their novelty drinks. 

We were dressed up and everything but we were treated like we were there to ask for charity by the hostess. She was super rude.

They have a section with awkward little tables where one side is booth and the other is a chair and you are 6" away from the next table. Do you know what I am talking about? 
Anyway, we got taken to those tables, even though the place was EMPTY and we were asked to sit between a couple on a date and a loud group of girls probably celebrating their 21st bday. I asked the hostess if we could sit on a different table and she was super annoyed. 

She took us to another crappy table but at least not crashing a date and a party, our ridiculously good looking waiter came and took our order (I think all waitstaff is required to be really, really, ridiculously good looking to work there)  

We ordered some of those drinks overflowing with candy, because there are $38, how can you not? If you don't find the $1.50 worth of candy exciting enough, they put Liquid nitrogen to make the price worth it. The flavor was nice, but for the price I expected a nice buzz and I got nothing but a tummy ache.  

My friend and I ordered burgers and we both hated them. I had the mediterranean veggie with feta cheese and it was very dry, I think it needed a tahini dressing or some sort of condiment. When I asked the waiter if he had any condiment to go in it, he brought me a cup of french onion soup....WTF?

$100 later, I only have 2 words that describe this place perfectly: Tourist Trap
