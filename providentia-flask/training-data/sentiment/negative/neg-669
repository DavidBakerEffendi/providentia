I used to LOVE Cantina!  I am really upset Frank sold it to some group that is COMPLETELY incompetent.  We first walked in without being addressed at all by the hostess.  We had to just start speaking.  We got Brittanie as our waitress and before we ordered she took the menus.  Luckily, I had one in our seat by the booth to pass around to all the people so we could order from it.  My friend had to ask for water over 4 times.  We ordered an appetizer and immediately after it came our entree's came as well.  All she could say was "oops your entrees came fast!  hehehehe."  She charged me for 3 drinks instead of two and took 10 minutes to bring our checks after we said we were in a hurry.  This really ruined it for me.  Bring back Frank to whip them into shape!
