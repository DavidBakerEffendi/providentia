I am very sad to report that our service was poor for Sunday brunch. We waited over 45 minutes for a meal that was eaten in about 15 minutes, as it was a simple order. The restaurant was fairly empty, so crowds were not the issue that affected service. The food was very good, and I would go back again in hopes of better service.
