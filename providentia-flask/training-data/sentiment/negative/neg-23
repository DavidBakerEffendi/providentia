Food is good, but service was slow. Being able to walk in on a Friday and not have a wait, you would assume that the service would be quick and on point. We waited about 45- an hour before our food came out.and by that time both my kids had been finished and ready to go home. The kitchen was way to slow for how "busy" they were.... 
 Tip the kids menu pizza is enough for dinner for 2 it's a 10" pizza and worth the $5.50. Order your kids meal first!
