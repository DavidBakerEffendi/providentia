HUGELY disappointing!!!!  OK...we went here just because it was rated the #1 restaurant on trip adviser.  Wait to be seated...awesome...service...UNREAL.  Food...bleh.  We ordered 2 different entrees and an appetizer...honestly..we didn't finish them...we told the server we were not able to eat them...he apologized.  We actually got dessert...since we were still hungry...after not eating!  It was good..some sort of pineapple cake.  Overall...I won't go back.
