This place must have changed owners. It used to be my favorite Chinese place to order from! Now, it is 100% garbage. 
We ordered food for four and they only got one order correct. The egg drop soup smelled like the eggs had gone bad, the chicken tasted like the oil hadn't been changed in years, and the rice was rock hard! This is all not to mention that half our order was missing!
Please do not eat here!! I would hate for anyone to waste their money and risk food poisoning. I'm SURE we all would have been sick had we not chosen to skip dinner that night.
