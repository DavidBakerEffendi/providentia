Sucks. 

We used to like Grazie. They were way ahead of the game years ago with delicious pizzas and salads that smacked of genuine Italian authenticity and could be counted on for a nice meal.

It's been a few years though since visiting snd tonight I ordered a pizza to go. Simple stuff. 

We ordered the the "Sofia" which the menu said included Smoked Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano and Prosciutto. I specifically asked for a well done pizza. 

The pie we received for almost $20 however was a tasteless disappointment. The prosciutto was sliced so thick that it was literally like luncheon meat on the pie - heavy and inedible. I've never seen prosciutto on a pizza sliced so poorly. It was globbed all over the pie haphazardly - a mess. 

Our pie was underdone - not well done. 

The dough was bland and flavorless.

I feel bad because Grazie used to be dependable and was a charming place. Now - it feels like it's winding down and over. 

The pizzas at North Italia are far superior. 

Cibo downtown (who apparently used to be partners with the Grazie owner years ago) is eons better than this once delicious dining spot. 

Ciao Grazie, we won't be back.
