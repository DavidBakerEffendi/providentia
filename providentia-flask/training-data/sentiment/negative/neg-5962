Mediocre Food, awful service.

Went there last night, hungry for a good steak. The atmosphere was initially cool, with a guy in the center playing piano. Once we sat down, things quickly deteriorated.
 
The place was not busy, yet our waitress took a good 15 minutes to get our first drinks...then another 15 to take our order. She pretty much ignored us the rest of the time, and instead joked around with the cooks and bartender.
 
My order was simple: an 8 oz Fillet Mignon, cooked medium. The steak came out CHARRED, and though the very center of the steak was OK, everything else was crispy. I've had better steak at Applebee's.
 
Even the salad was lacking, just generic, hardly fresh lettuce.
 
Basically, I could have prepared a better dinner myself, for a fraction of the price. And I'm not a professional chef by any means.
 
To top things off, a group of rowdy men came in for a dinner towards the end of our lackluster meal. After a bit, one turned and loudly insulted us for reasons undefined. Nobody did anything about this. We eventually left our table, and took another near the bar. Our server came over, we told her what happened, and she just laughed it off.
 
This is hands-down the worst dining experience I've had in the Cleveland area.
