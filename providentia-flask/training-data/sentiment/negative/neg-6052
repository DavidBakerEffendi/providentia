I don't give bad reviews very often but this place was terrible! I orderd the beef brisket sandwich and 90% of the meat was FAT. I called the waitress over and she agreed it was not even edible. She brought me a new sandwich and it had about 50% FAT.  I picked through the mixture of sauce, meat and fat and pulled put the meat that I could eat. I tried my wife's chicken pasta and the food was bland. Food was way over priced, yeah I get it's Vegas, but still hurts to pay a $50 for only eating half of your food and drinking an over priced beer. You are better off going to the food court and getting something cheaper!
