My wife and I went here for our 3rd anniversary last night. I ordered the blue cheese crusted filet and when the food came I let the server know that my order was wrong (honest mistake). What was brought to the table was the sliced filet with mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes. The server took the food away and was back pretty fast with the "right" entree. The server brought me a plate of sliced meat with blue cheese melted on top. When I questioned the plate I realized the kitchen had taken my old wrong dish, rinsed it off and put blue cheese crumbles on top, instead of cooking me a new filet which was not supposed to be sliced (or rinsed). Absolutely disgusting! I urge anyone who enjoys a good meal to NEVER spend your money at this restaurant! The management was very understanding and attempted to rectify the issue but at that point I had completely lost my appetite.
