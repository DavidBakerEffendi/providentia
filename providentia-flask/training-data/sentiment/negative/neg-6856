This place sucks, only two people ahead of me and I've been waiting super long! The lady that handed me the food didn't apologize for the wait, not that it was her job to do that, but it would have been nice for somebody to at least acknowledge the extended wait time. The girl working as the cashier was like a robot, she didn't do anything wrong, but when you looked at her you could just tell that she was just not the happiest person in the world and neither am I, but when you're dealing with customers at least try and smile just a little bit.
