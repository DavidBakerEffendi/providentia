Had a very poor experience last Friday. The wait to place your order was long and when a second person opened a register, she was RUDE! I ordered a turkey burger with no bun and a side salad (restricted diet) and she looked at me like I was crazy. When I said I wanted a 1/4 lb patty, she grunted, one size only. She omitted the cheese, even though I didn't ask for no cheese, and when I asked for salsa, pointed at the bar where I could get it myself. I had never eaten here before, so I was unaware it was available me there, no need to be rude. I was with two other people who ordered separate and by the time my dry, bland turkey party was called, my friends were done eating. I was then appalled to see that the woman who was so rude to me at the counter was apologizing to a table near me for an error with their food, so I am assuming she was some sort of leader at the facility. I am shocked that this woman was in any capacity to apologize for poor service. The only good interaction I had was with a female busses with long brown hair who asked to remove dishes and appeared to be working very hard. Needless to say, I will not be returning.
