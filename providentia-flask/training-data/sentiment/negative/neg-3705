Bad experience. I have been here several times and LOVED everything. Something has happened... First of all we were sat 40 minutes after our reservations. We ordered Moscow mules but they did not have enough copper cups and one person got a glass. The drinks were spot on for the first round but undrinkable after that. The service was poor. My NY strip was average, similar to an Outback steak. My brother in law did not have his ordered delivered. The manger came out to apologize but his speech sounded "canned" as though he had been saying the same thing all night. One of our favorite appetizers is the pretzels, again disappointing when the insides were cold, they normally taste freshly baked. Many items were taken off our bill but for average food and poor service a bill for over $300 seemed steep. Overall I am so sad, this was my favorite restaurant and consistent great food was delivered in the past, not sure what happened but I will not return until I hear things have changed.
