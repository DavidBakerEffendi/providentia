I use to like coming here. But the past three times at this specific location has put a halt to my liking. Today I had went in there for a quick breakfast, Amy as my server, and it was pretty much hi and bye. She was too busy talking to everyone else before she could find out I had no condiments. First off, how do you have a table with Ketchup, Hot sauce of two kinds, salt and pepper, and EVERYTHING is empty but the salt and pepper!? She never came back to find out because the two times she came was to drop the food, then drop the check. No napkins, no refills, nothing. Flip the egg for service? Then what, get up and look for my server and wave her down? No thanks. Use to be my favorite spot in town, but today just changed my perspective on that...
