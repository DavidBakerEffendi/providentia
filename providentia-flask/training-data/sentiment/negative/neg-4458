I just took my son and daughter to this restaurant tonight I've eaten there before over a year ago and food was pretty good they've change the menu however tonight we sat down the manager status gave us a free appetizer because of the situation then she told us she was going to give us the best waiter that waiter came and sauce got us our drinks and never came back for over an hour!

Then on top of that when we are about ready to walk out of the restaurant the food came all three of us ate our dinner and left and we all went to our homes and called each other within 20 minutes and we all had food poisoning and sick

I am never going back to this restaurant employees are rude inconsiderate
Food was horrible.. Asparagus was old hard and overcooked and my daughter ordered salmon which was old and smelled old and was dry horrible horrible!!
