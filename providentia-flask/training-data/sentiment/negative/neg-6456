Me and my wife came all the way out from CA to see old town Flagstaff. The service was poor, and the food was mediocre. I was hoping for some authentic tex-mex food but the food is very bland. The margaritas we ordered were mainly just mixer and lime, and we only saw out waitress 2-3 times. Avoid if you're looking for a good experience and great food
