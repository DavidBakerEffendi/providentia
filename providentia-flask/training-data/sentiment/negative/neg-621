Kim Dinh is up at McCowan and Bur Oak in the same plaza as Sobey's.

I ordered a Large Pho with raw beef and tripes. 

The soup was not hot! 
The soup was super salty! (I was thirsty for the whole evening after eating this! tons of MSG!)
The noodle was the dried type! (and not really prepared well)
The raw beef is really quite raw.. but not because they want to prepare it that way, just because the soup is not hot enough to cook them properly!
The tripe was the worse part of the meal.. It was in big chunks and just throw on top of the noodles with no preparation. Just like something they just got from the open tub from the Chinese supermarket! 

They really not specialized in vietnamese cuisine.. There are thai, malaysian dish in the menu. 

No lunch Special!

They accepts VISA and MC for orders over $10
