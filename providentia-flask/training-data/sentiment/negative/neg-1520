I understand that it was New Years Eve, but even still I couldn't have been more disappointed in our food. First, the price... We thought we'd try something different than the usual take out pizza and wings. Way overpriced. Secondly, the food itself. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and 48 wings (half bone in and half boneless). There was no real evidence of sauce on the pizza and no flavor to the cheese or meat. The bone in wings that were supposed to be Buffalo had a bad, sweet aftertaste to them. We tried to call, but as I said earlier, it was a holiday. $60 was waisted last night on dinner. Very disappointed and I'll be hard pressed to ever eat at this location again. I have eaten at 2 other locations in the past (Surprise and downtown Phoenix) both were good.  Too bad the food doesn't stay consistent.
