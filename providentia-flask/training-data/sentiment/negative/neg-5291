Had my first and final visit to this place recently.  I should have fled upon noticing the number of flies hanging around the place and the greasy smear (hair grease?) on the window beside us; instead, we remained and were studiously ignored by the waiter and served food that was so-so at best.  The roast duck had a nice flavor but was mostly bones.  (Duck neck.  Yum.)  The other dishes we had were fair to poor.  I really WANTED to like this place, but really can't think of anything good to say about it.
