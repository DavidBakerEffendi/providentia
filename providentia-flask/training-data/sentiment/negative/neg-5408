While Waiting for my food to be ready the cook was scrubbing the counter with soap. He never changed his gloves or washed his hands. Saw him grab the bacon with his hands and put it in the microwave. I had to ask him to change his gloves and make me another cheddar bacon fries. Please be careful when you eat here.
