Stayed at the Venetian Hotel & Casino for four nights and play blackjack for four days and at the end of The trip I want to cash out my comps and I received $0.00 in comps because they said I played a long time but I only played the minimum nobody told me that there are no signs in the pit boss never said that if I put one more chip  I would receive credit find another casino to go to they don't seem to be too honest at the Venetian
