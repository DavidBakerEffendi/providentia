It had been years since we have eaten at the Wagon Wheel. Like 6 our 7

Let say the prices are went SKY HIGH. (And we are cheap people either)

I got just the basic breakfast, two eggs, toast (that was burnt) & potatoes, i got 6.  Guess the cook could spare any more then 6.     For $6.50 wasn't worth the money.

Also got a mushroom & swiss omelette. Not enough mushroom to call it an omelette and extra for potatoes. Which he got 6 also

They lost our business. Im sure it wont close them down since we wont eat their again.   

But your sides need to be a bigger.
