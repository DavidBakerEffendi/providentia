I love the original Sweet Tomatoes, so I was already disapointed that they changed it but decided to give field kitchen a chance. It was terrible. The whole process was confusing and took much longer. I tried the salad bar choice and my boyfriend chose the hot food option. He had his food a good 10 minutes before I was back to the table and it wasn't even the right entree he had ordered. I got one bowl of salad and one cup of macaroni. You have to wait for someone to give you salad dressing even if you make your own salad and it's just a mess. A worker was helping the two girls in front of me, and then a second worker walked up and started helping the husband and wife behind me. Somehow I got missed and ending up waiting quite a while just for someone to give me a cup of salad dressing. And if I had wanted to add extras like chicken or avocado I would have had to wait in yet another line. I never even got a drink because that would have been yet another line to wait in and since my boyfriend had already been waiting all this time with his food getting cold I didn't feel like wasting more time standing in line. And it was actually more expensive than it would have been if both of us had ordered the all you can eat at the original sweet tomatoes. The whole pay system is odd too. They give you a card you have to swipe at each of these stations to get your food. Each person has their own card so you couldnt even get a drink for someone else in your party. And if you lose your card, you will be charged $50. The whole experience was a huge dissapointment and I will NOT be back. I will drive 20 minutes out of my way to go to the old Sweet Tomatoes by Metrocenter. I just hope they doing ruin that one anytime soon.
