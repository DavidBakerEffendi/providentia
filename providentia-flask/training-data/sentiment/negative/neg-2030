Just don't waste your time or money on this restaurant.  Their website is much more impressive than their establishment.  We tried this restaurant because they touted their $4.95 lunch specials in their mailer.  My friend and I went in, but guess what?  The lunch specials aren't even on the menu.  

We waited ten minutes after being seated before we were asked for our order, at which time we asked about the lunch specials and were told, "Chicken Fried Rice or Sweet & Sour Chicken."

After asking for one minute to look back over the menu because the options for the lunch menu were pretty slim, we waited another ten minutes until we were asked for our orders again, even though our menus were clearly closed and stacked on the edge of the table.

My friend's water glass had lipstick stains on it.  The water tasted like lemon-flavored dish soap.  The table was sticky.  My overall impression of this restaurant was heading downhill super fast.

Then our food came out.  My friend's fried rice was mushy, and her veggies were burnt.  My sweet and sour chicken tasted like stir fry covered with Manwich.  I've never had tomato-based sweet and sour in my life.  Nasty.

Then we were ready to go, and had to go to the register because no one would bring us our check.   The service was horrible and we felt like we were treated poorly because we ordered the lunch specials.  

We will not be returning to Papaya Thai, and will tell anyone who will listen to avoid it.  This was my friend's first Thai experience and she says she's unlikely to ever try Thai cuisine again because of it.  Yeah, it was that bad.  (and the indigestion that followed for both of us was extremely unpleasant)  And it's not family friendly either.

Head down to Mint Thai on Gilbert Road between Baseline and Guadalupe or drive to Malee's on Main or A Touch of Thai in Old Town Scottsdale.  These restaurants are superior to Papaya Thai in every respect.
