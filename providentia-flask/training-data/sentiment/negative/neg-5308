Ordered a smash cake for my son a week prior to the date needed. Went to pick it up and they never made it. They said the would quickly make it and it would be ready in 30 minutes. Over an hour later we were able to pick up a cake. Got home about 10 minutes before the party started. The taste was okay. Definitely not the same as this bakery used to be. I'll be on the lookout for a new bakery.
