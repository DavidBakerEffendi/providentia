What a letdown and disappointment.  For the price paid ($35) and the QUALITY of items available it is below the standards of others on the strip and in Henderson.  

I took a family of 4 during breakfast hours and nobody was impressed.  This used to be better in years past.

I unfortunately can't recommend this place.
