Like an earlier review I am also a frequent patron. I can honeslty say this place is falling apart not just in service quality but also physically. The patio umbrellas are completely broke.  The floors are not kept and I told my group to please wipe there shoes on the pavement before entering my truck.  The food quality was good but not great as it use to be.  I am worried this place may not make it even though it has a huge following.
