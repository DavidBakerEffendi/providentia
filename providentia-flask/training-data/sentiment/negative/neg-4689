The menu is ridiculously small. 20 items and a plate of pasta $35 dollars. I don't know if its fake Yelp advertisement or what, but the deserts that are on the pictures online weren't in that menu. When the host sat us she said our table was the best on the restaurant, ‍ really? Next to the bathroom? No thank you. I'll pass!! Stupid "fancy" restaurant.
