Don't come here! We were given set menus, which should speed up he serving. To the contrary, we still did not recieve our mains three hours in. At that point, they were still figuring out who had what main.

The food itself was burnt to edible.
Don't come.
I believe the four star average rating and the prior reviews were written by the owners and family.
