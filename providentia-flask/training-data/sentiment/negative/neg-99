Ordered a breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes, bacon, sour cream and red sauce. The burrito was about 95% mushy potato. It was like eating flavorless mashed potatoes wrapped in a tortilla. There were maybe 5 small pieces of bacon in the entire burrito and barely a drizzle of red sauce. Definitely don't recommend.
