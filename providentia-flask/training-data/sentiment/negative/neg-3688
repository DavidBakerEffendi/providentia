I was willing to forgive the fact that they originally forgot both of my kids sandwiches when I called and they promised it would be waiting for me when I got back here to get them. They weren't ready. I had to wait AGAIN. And then, I got the sandwiches and one of them was completely wrong (turkey and cheese when it was supposed to be pb&j). So I had to wait for a THIRD time and just now, 40 minutes after I originally arrived, I'm finally getting my sandwiches. This is insane. I could maaaaaaaaybe forgive if it was busy in here BUT IT'S NOT! How hard is it to make some freaking sandwiches?!
