After paying and walking threw the buffet at Bellagio, in all honesty I had to ask a staff member "Is this the only buffet in the casino??" I seriously thought this was some kind of express version of the vaunted "Bellagio Buffet".  "No sir this is it." I contemplated leaving before even being seated and asking for a refund but with a long line at the desk, I estimated cost in my time and aggravation would greatly exceed the admission price, so I pressed on.

Food offered was "ok" by cheap buffet standards but there was absolutely NOTHING special about it and I mean NOTHING. The local Indian Casino, Mohegan Sun near my house in Connecticut has a better buffet and the buffet at Aria puts this to shame.

Service was awful and staff was about as friendly as I would expect in a registry of motor vehicles office.

Having read and seen on the television quite a big deal being made about the Bellagio Buffet, I can't recall ever being so let down in an actiual dining experience comparing hype to reality.


I would not go back ever again even if the meal was free......
