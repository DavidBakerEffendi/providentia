I really hate to give bad reviews (this is my first ever bad review) but this place is to be avoided. The prices are absurdly high for the portions you get. But based on the taste of the food the small portions aren't a bad thing. I had the beef tacos. They were four mini beef tacos (served with no side whatsoever), the meat was extremely dry. The only way to salvage them was to dump loads of salsa and sour cream on them. I also ordered what the menu said was a pina colada I took one sip and immediately pushed it to the side (they had the courtesy to not charge me for it). All in all it was a really bad experience and I would not go there again nor recommend this place to anyone.
