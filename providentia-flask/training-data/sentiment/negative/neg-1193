Stunningly mediocre. I had never had bland oysters before. The saltines that came with them were stale. I couldn't finish the beer the server recommended, and the steak required significant amounts of A1 to even attempt. The mashed potatoes were passable at best. Drive the extra ways into Charlotte to get a real steak or seafood dinner. Bleh.
