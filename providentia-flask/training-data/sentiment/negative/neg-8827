I know Chinese restaurants aren't exactly known for their excellent service, but this place is downright rude even by Chinese restaurant standards.  

The waiter just plopped the water pitcher down and quickly walked away.  After that, I was expecting the waiter to tell us that we needed to prepare our own food. Not once did a waiter or waitress ask if we needed more water, etc.  The only time our waiter forced an unconvincing smile on his face was when it was time to pay the bill.

On the plus side though, the food was pretty good. My family enjoyed the choi sum, chow fun with beef and the fried calamari.

It's too bad the horrible service outweighed the tasty food. Highly unlikely we'll ever dine here again on our next visit to Las Vegas.
