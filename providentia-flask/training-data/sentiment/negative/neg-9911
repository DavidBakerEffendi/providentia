Someone please explain this place to me because I just don't get it.

Saw this on a few friends' Instagrams and it looked like such a pretty cafe to check out. I came with a friend Sunday afternoon - the aesthetics of this place is really on point, and that's all you can say about this place.

So you go in, wowed by the decor, then realize they don't seat you and you have to order and be given a number, then you seat yourself and they'll serve you. Totally fine - there's about less than 15 tables spread across 2 floors plus a private room for events. 

Anyway, they had a few donuts they were sampling, and each one tasted worse than the previous. Maybe I should forewarn you that I'm not vegan... so I'm not too sure if all vegan food tastes like this? But the donuts tasted like a mixture of cardboard and plastic dipped in sugar. 

My friend and I were horrified by the donuts so we didn't even attempt to try the food even though it looked nice. We each just grabbed a drink - a soy London fog which was too sweet for me, and a tropical smoothie which tasted like half a lemon and a banana blended together. For about $5+/drink I'd say you are so much better off going to Starbucks - but hey you can get a nice Instagram out of this place if you care about that.

So so disappointed by this place and so surprised they recently opened up in Yorkville. I honestly don't know what type of customers come here on a regular cause this food is inedible. I feel sorry for vegans and your limited food choices.
