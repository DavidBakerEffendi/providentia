I would never go back!  The service was horrible... Sat with empty drinks for half the night, even after asking.  The food was very average and way overpriced.  I honestly would have rather eaten at Olive Garden, which I compare even their food to microwaved tasting entrees.  The sauce was not good and the shrimp was chewy.  I thought the seating was too close; felt crowded.  Don't waste your time and money.
