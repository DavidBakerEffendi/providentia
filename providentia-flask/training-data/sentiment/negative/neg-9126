This place is a dump. Walked in and planned to have lunch here, but it reeked like bleach and sweat so bad that I left. Super outdated, junky, pot holes all over the parking lot, a really crappy area. The food looks really good in the pictures, but I don't trust it based on how the inside of this place looks.
