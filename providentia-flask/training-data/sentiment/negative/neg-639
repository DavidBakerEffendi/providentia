We stopped by here for an early Valentine's dinner, feeling lucky it was pretty empty. We stood by the "please wait to be seated" sign for a while with no acknowledgement. Finally we sorted thru our phones for the other options in the area with the thought "maybe they'll seat us before we decide on a second place to go". We ended up leaving and going elsewhere.
