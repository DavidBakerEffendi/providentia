Worst experience ever. I was so disappointed.  There should be an option for a stink weed because this place does not deserve even one star.

The service was absolutely horrible.  We stopped in for sangria and a bite before the U2 concert last weekend and our server was so rude. He was just outright rude. Abrasive. Unfriendly. He was such a jerk that I wondered how he even had a job. 

We only got to one drink and one appetizer. The sangria was too sweet and the cornbread had way too much corn in it and it was falling apart. The cornbread at the other location was so great. Such a difference. We left after one drink because it was so awful and went down the street to the Strand for much much better and friendlier service. 

I will never go back to this location under any circumstances. Our server is in the wrong industry. He should be a grave digger. 

The other location was so opposite- great, friendly service and incredible food.
