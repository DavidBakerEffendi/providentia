This place takes the cake for crappy experiences to date. Hubby and I went here for breakfast one morning after getting the kids off to school. The initial impression was more of a commercial version of a lodge/woodsy themed Denny's. On to breakfast. We both got whatever they call their signature huge breakfast. First impression, it looks decent. Servers, brisk, not friendly, efficient, to be expected. Then we tasted our meals. The pancakes were decent...until I found a nasty black hair under them. The ham steaks were very under-cooked and jello-like in texture. My husband's hash browns tasted very freezer burnt, they forgot the cheese on my scrambled eggs, and there was ANOTHER hair stuck to my glass. Pretty much vile on every level. No compensation whatsoever, and even our website complaint has yet to be responded to. Hopefully they don't waste plastic and send us a gift card. We will not be back. Ever.
