I'm not a big fried chicken fan and I have not been to a KFC in years.  I kept seeing all these ads for how KFC has changed.  They lowered the prices and now have supposed grilled chicken.  NOPE, still awful.  I got a box meal and it was cold.  I ordered a bowl for my husband and they charged me for something else, which was more money.  No sorry or a refund.  I won't be back.
