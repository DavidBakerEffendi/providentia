I just had the WORST experience here at Amalfi's.  Our waitress was absolutely AWFUL - she acted like we were a burden and we were the ONLY people in the joint!  She was extremely curt, rude and majorly unhappy with her job and had no interest in being a decent waitress at all.  The owners really need to fire her.  It seemed to be family night - as in the family that ran the place was there - and they were only interested in watching the NASCAR race on tv.  We ordered salad and got a watery, disjointed handful of greens thrown on a plate.  I waited til my pizza came to tell the waitress about the awful salad, because I was afraid she would do something to my food.  I told her it was all watery (literally, there was water all in the plate) and instead of saying something like "oh I'm so sorry", she actually told me that yes, it was watery because it was "fresh and from the garden."  Yes, that was what she said.  So my pizza was burnt on the bottom and had virtually no sauce - it was one of the worst pizzas I've ever had.  And this place was like a sitcom... other people came in that seemed to be friends with the staff and owners and they all had bizarre interactions with each other... the owners yelled at the waitress a lot, who kept going outside and sitting on the bench...  when our pizza was done, the cook put it on the counter and slammed his pizza cutter down and yelled at the owners to go get the waitress, who was outside again... the owners were yelling at the cook at some point later...  I was still eating my pizza - actually EATING the pizza - and the waitress came over and asked if I wanted a box for the three pieces that were left on the platter, and I said no, and then she asked me if I was done.  I stopped EATING to say NO, I'M STILL EATING.  Ugh, what a nightmare this place was.  Horrible.  Stay away.  You've been warned.
