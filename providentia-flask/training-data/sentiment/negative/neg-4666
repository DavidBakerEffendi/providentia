This is most certainly the worse Chinese I have had in AZ. I ordered a stir fry dish and it smothered in a very foul sauce, all the veggies ended up being super soggy. I would honestly describe this food as a really bad pei wei knock off. I personally do not care for Pei Wei, but it's the only thing that describes it well. If you want anything even remotely authentic go somewhere else!
