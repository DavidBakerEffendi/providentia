Waited an hour for food that had to be sent back. Potato was raw in the center.   Steak was charred.  

Noticed the other table had to send something back as well.  There was hardly anyone in the place so the experience couldn't be linked to volume.

Server did the best he could with what he had to work with.

This is our second trip back after a bad first one.  I am distressed at my learning curve.
