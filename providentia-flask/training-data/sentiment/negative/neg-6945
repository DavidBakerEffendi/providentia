Really irritated with today's visit. We sat ourselves because no one was at the door to seat us (and the sign indicated we should do so) and then waited for anyone to notice us. 
No idea who our "server" ultimately was but she came over with menus and asked us for our drink orders. When I asked for a draft list (on National Beer Day) she said they didn't have one. Not sure if that was lazy BS or not but I've never been to another JJs that didn't have a draft list (including previous visits to this one). She told me I could walk up to the bar to look at the taps. So Danielle and I just ordered soft drinks then waited again for those drinks while our buxom brunette server disappeared then reappeared several minutes later checking on other tables without our drinks. Ultimately we just left. 
I used to be a regular at the Valley location which started slipping when this location opened. Now this place is following the same trend. 
It'd be forgivable if the food was anything special but outside of one or 2 things it's all pretty blah. Even their wing sauces all taste the same. 
Unless I hear the they have 120 Minute IPA again, I'm likely done with this location for a while.
