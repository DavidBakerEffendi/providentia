Horrible customer service!!!!!  
My friend specifically asked for no crab. When we told the waitress she said no way and got the manager. We did not even ask to remake the order but the manager immediately prompted that they can't remake the order and it's impossible that there's crab in it. They kept arguing and charged her full price his supposedly a manager with no skills Nicolas Ortho shouldn't be running peppermill
