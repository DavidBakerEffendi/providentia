I walk in alone for lunch and wait at the front to be seated. Waiters walk past me making no eye contact, so I go to the cash register in the back of the restaurant and ask if I need to order first before being seated. The manager says to me that I should wait to be seated as the sign in the front says. He has a menu in his hand and I assume that he is going to seat me. Although the restaurant in 3/4 empty, he tells me to go back up front by the sign and he will seat me. I go back to the front and read the sign which says, "Thank you for coming." He eventually comes to seat me and I point out the sign, which he then replaces with the one, "Please wait to be seated." Normally, I would walk out due to the arrogance of the manager, but I am hungry, tired, and have little time, so I take the seat where I am directed, order. I should have walked out when the waiters ignored me. The chicken cashew lunch special tasted like last week's leftovers. The thinly sliced chicken was so tough that I could barely chew it and the vegetables were frozen mush. We have a lot of choices in Scottsdale to enjoy Vietnamese food; this would be my last choice, and someplace I'll never go into again.
