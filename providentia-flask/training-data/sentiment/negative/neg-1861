Worst location ever! I ordered quite a large order from here for my partner's birthday. They took over two hours to deliver and we were supposed to surprise him!! 

We endlessly called after an hour and NOBODY picked up the phone and the voicemail was a cell phone because it said, "we're sorry, but the wireless customer is unavailable right now...". It was so frustrating. 

Then we ended up calling the location at Dufferin and Bloor and told them our issue and they said they have over taken orders from the Popeyes at St. Claire more times than they could count. We ordered again from them and our original order eventually showed up. I complained to the driver and I felt bad after because it seemed as though he has suffered from these complaints before and immediately gave me a discount. 

I then had to call the other Popeye's location and cancel the order. They were so super chill and said no problem and suggested we call them from now on. Which we will do. 

Who the heck takes over 2 hours to deliver food which is legit a five minute drive away. 

So wrong!
