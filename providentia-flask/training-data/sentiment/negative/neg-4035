We are always in search of new Indian restaurants in hopes of finding a decent one. We went here with low expectations and came out with an even lower bar - if that was possible. I would actually give this negative rating if yelp allowed that.

The food was not even remotely Indian - Every thing was doused in mayo which is definitely not a component of Indian cooking. The "daal" was merely boiled lentils seasoned with salt and pepper - again with no Indian flavors or taste.I had a n aloo tikki wrap and the potato patty was burnt and taste.

We could barely eat half of our meal. When I asked about the chef , the waiter confessed that the chef was not Indian though he was trying to learn Indian cooking.

On our way out, we agreed this was probably the "NEW LOW" in Indian food in the valley.We will never go back.
