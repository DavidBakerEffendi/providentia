Very Disappointed!  I have eaten at Bz N Dz in the South Park area (right beside the trolley tracks) and it has always been good. This visit to the one in Mt Lebanon was disappointing. I ordered a Loaded Salad with Chicken and my husband ordered a Chicago Dog with Chili Cheese fries.  
My husband really liked his Chicago Dog but the chili on the fries tasted like It came straight from the can. Yuck!
When my salad came it looked good-Spring Mix greens, tomatoes and cucumbers. I was ready to dig in. I ate some of my salad and realized there was no chicken. I took the salad back up to the counter and told them they had forgotten the chicken. The server took my salad and said she would take care of it. Well, I waited and waited and waited. I watched while all of the customers get served their food and milkshakes. Finally my husband stopped the waitress and asked about my salad. I think it's safe to say that they had forgotten all about it. They finally brought me out a new salad and when I went to eat a piece of the chicken it was gross. It looked like they had taken bits of the dark meat of a chicken and pressed them together. It was gray, had a weird texture, and had no taste.   I ended up asking for a To Go box. I thought one of my boys would eat it. Nope. We ended up feeding the "chicken" to our dogs. 
I don't think we'll go back.
