I decided to give this place a second chance after my first visit ended in extremely slow service and nearly raw eggs that made me sick. 
We expected slow service on this visit because it was a Holiday weekend.  After waiting over an hour for our food, we asked to speak to the manager who told us that this should be expected because of the Holiday and offered no apology.  He went back to the kitchen and advised us that our food would be out in five minutes. After waiting another 10 to 15 minutes, the food finally came out one meal short. We were offered no apology or discount for the forgotten meal and slow service. Nothing on our ticket was comped. I was super bummed and wanted to like this place, but for "OK" food and bad service, it is not worth it.
