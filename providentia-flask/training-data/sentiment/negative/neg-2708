Food was good. Service was completely  absent. 20-25min to get water. Food came out at different times. One main meal was never put in and after finally getting the attention of the server, waiting 30-45min, to address this issue the order had to be switched as take out because it took that long. This meant not eating with my group for which I am very upset. Service had to be waved down for attention. By the end, I had to wave payment just to pay. With this little attention on thier tables or concern for payment, if this happens again, I will walk out. 

 It was embarrassing to have invited friends to dinner here. I was not expecting this due to other ratings. Not sure if this is due to being a Friday night.  I would not recommend coming here to eat on Friday nights. 

In regards to food, the artichoke dip, potatoes leek, and bangers was good. Shepard pie was not impressive but not sure if it was due to it being put for take out. It looked like slop.
