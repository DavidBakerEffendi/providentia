I've eaten at this location many times.. Unfortunately, the past few times were getting worse and worse.
This past experience has to be the worst tasting meal I've ever had over there.
I only eat vegetarian dishes.
This was the first time I ever eaten any Indian dish that turned out being sweet instead of being spicy. It had grapes it in for some reason and was very distracting and turned me off from the meal completely. Unfortunately, I ordered take out. So the entire meal which took over an hour to drive there and back turned into trash in a matter of minutes. My wife and I were very disappointed and had to warn the Yelp community. I hope I'm the last to have such a terrible experience.
