I am not sure why other people gave this restaurant more that 2 stars. I had a terrible dinner.

 The appetizer called a Charcuterie plate was dry, bland toast triangles, squares  of cheese like we used to have in high school, some dried cranberries and almonds. 

Their Twisted Burger, which was supposed to be their specialities, had so much overly sweet onion jam, barely cooked bacon, unmelted cheese and tons of mayo that it was inedible.. The fries were cold. And the most surprising part was the wine pour, barely 3 oz. in a big wine glass. The owner was running the bar. and the waitress told us that's all  he allowed.  The wine was really good, and was from their own winery. You would think they would give at least a normal pour as bottles are available for purchase. Talk about poor marketing!  After commenting to the waitress, the second glass had a little more. I asked to taste a wine and was told the bottle wasn't open and i would have to order a glass. Wouldn't it have made more sense to open the bottle, as I may have purchased it or at least had 1-2 glasses. Poor marketing again.

This was the second time I tried this restaurant, knowing it was bad the first. But wanted to give them another chance as they were new the first time.  I would have thought they would cater more to their patrons, as this time of the year, most of us in AZ are residents and it could become one of our favorites.  I hate to see restaurants destroy themselves when a new chef and some better customer service, along with a customer-friendly owner could surely help.
