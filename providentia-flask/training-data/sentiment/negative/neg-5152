The worst buffet las vegas has. Very low quality items, heavy on the carbs. $43 a person. Bellagio should be embarrassed to put there name on such a low quality dining experience. The food is served in large trays, mushed , dry, low quality. Inexpensive ingredients. Complained and the manager acted as if it was the first time he ever got a complaint. Honestly the buffet was like a cici pizza buffet for $12. Any other buffet in las vegas is better then this. Recommend cosmopolitan buffet. This buffet is excellent for $20 max. Stay away. Unless you enjoy the lowest quality dining experience.


In response to Bellagios comments, i would not eat at your buffet for free honestly. Its 0 quality. Eat at any other buffet in Las Vegas and take notes.
