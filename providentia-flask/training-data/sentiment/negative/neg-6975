We had bought a restaurants.com coupon so we thought we would checkout out. First, they seemed a bit disorganized and we were the only customers. I ordered the Black Forest sandwich hot. My wife ordered the chicken salad in a tomato. She thought hers was ok. Second, I assumed hot meant toasted; no hot means the bread was put in a microwave. The description included  provolone cheese. My sandwich came with some version of cheddar cheese. I should have known we were in for an adventure when my sandwich was being made and one of the "cooks" asked the other staff was provolone cheese was. I thought the sandwich was very small for the price: $6.99. We will not be going back for a future adventure.
