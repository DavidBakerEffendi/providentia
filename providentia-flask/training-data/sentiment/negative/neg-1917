Let me start by saying the word Resort should NOT be part of this basic hotels name. Im disappointed. The propety has not been maintained well...it has a wierd smell in the hallways. There was dog hair all on the floors. Not cool for someone who is allergic to dogs. There was a what appeared to be a whole in the door. I always check for bed bugs so of course i check the mattres and one had a huge pissy lookin stain and not sure what was on the other. They need to at least touch up the furniture. There was a comb full of hair in the couch. I could go on...long story short wont stay here again.
