This place suckkkkedddd. Bad food. 
I came here for my graduation dinner and I definitely left feeling like I missed out on a nice, celebratory dinner.
My mum's lettuce was floppy. My gyro looked like a period pad (no joke, I wish I took a picture!)
The waitress seemed so flustered that we felt like we were bothering her by asking for drink refills and the food she forgot.
The cool part was the fire lounges, seriously, those are cool! But, the whole place was filthy! If you can tell a place doesn't vacuum, I don't wanna be there. 
Sorry, Peppermill, time to retire or get new staff!
