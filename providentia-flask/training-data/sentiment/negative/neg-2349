I did not even try the food, why? Because the way the people that work there talk to me told me they did not wanted to work there. Rude and just for the money people. Then I came to yelp to see their reviews, I knew these were going to be low, and they were low. I can tell you, it is difficult to ruin a simple burrito, but if you have the wrong people on it, they will ruin anything! To the owner: "take care of your place!"
