Drove by recognized the Caribbean restaurant  after entering and not being greeted. I had to asked for a menu and quietly mention is Roti on it, she abruptly told me this was a Jamaican restaurant . A menu was handed To me, I ordered jerk chicken as I was waiting for my dish to come out and enjoy a spicy Jamaican dish I was handed a Styrofoam box in a bag and offered a plastic fork to go ,it was absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at any Caribbean restaurant that only serves Jamaican food . now let's start with the dish that I had to eat at home two pieces of chicken with spice jerk seasoning and a half  box "RICE" I will finish with this if your restaurant says Caribbean don't only provide Jamaican food ... And last but not least why is everything with french fries I mean french fries lol what a joke ...
