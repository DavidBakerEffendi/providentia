One of the worst dining experiences ever. - I ordered a Bloody Mary ($10) - the picture showed it with lots of yummy garnish - I got NONE - sent it back to be fixed meanwhile the waiter forgot my water so I'm thirsty.... they screwed up our salads (YES ... SALAD!!). I didn't even order one and all my husband wanted was his without the dates & pine nuts - waiter tells us the kitchen messed up - salads come FREEZING COLD and no dressing!  Meanwhile I had to remind him that I ordered lobster bisque - then he came back and said - you wanted the chowder, right !!!   NOOOOO Then steak is undercooked - the had to bring my 4th shrimp out separately because the forgot to make enough!!!  I ask for the manager ... tell him I typically don't complain but every part of the meal was messed up - he apologized and said "I'm going to take care of your bill" - they deducted $40 !?!?  We paid and YES I tipped the waiter a little cause I realize nobody's perfect - but unfortunately we will NEVER go back
