My friend and I stopped in to get something cold to drink, it was HOT outside.  I can't tell you what we ordered or if it was good or not.  What sticks out in my mind, to this day, is how rude the counterperson was. She acted annoyed that we were interrupting her work on a recent order and troubling her by wanting to place an order.  She also treated my friend like she was DUMB for not knowing the name of one of the drinks. To make it even better, was the fact that she didn't put your name on your cup when you ordered (like Starbucks does), so when she calls out the name of the DRINK she just made you don't know if it is actually yours or not. Genius right? I found this out only because she gave me a really nasty look for accidentally taking someone else's order. How was I supposed to know it wasn't mine? THEIR NAME WASN'T ON THE CUP!!! At this point I could care less how good the coffee or tea is at that establishment, I would rather die of thirst than go back there again, she was rude, rude, rude. 
And to be honest, I truly hope she was just having a bad day and doesn't treat her customers like this on a daily basis.
