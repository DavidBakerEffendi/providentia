Order my pizza extra well done and it came under cooked.  The service is great, and they rushed out another one but still not cooked properly.  Although I give an A for Effort the  it is spelled with and "E" and that is what the pizza was.  Only had 2 slices!!! Extremely disappointed.  

This was my second time ordering from Gino's the 1st was from store #41 in Niagara.  And, although I was very pleased with the quality of the pizza as well as the service I couldn't score it a 5. Maybe store #41 is just that much better than the others...again, very pleased overall.
