SO upset right now! Went to eat at this location on Monday 11/10/2014. Swiped my card and enjoyed an expensive meal. The horrible part was when I realized they had drained every dollar out of my checking account with one swipe! They ran the purchase 8 times (until I ran out of funds) and then ran it 12 (YES 12!) More times. I have been calling the restaurant since Monday evening and STILL have not heard from their corporate offices. I was told by my bank these were just "authorizations" and would not go through and all would be well tonight. GUESS AGAIN! My (stupid stupid stupid!) Bank (BVA Compass) processed every single charge (all 20 of them!) and charged me NSF fees for all of them. Its now 10 PM on Thursday and my account is $2500 in the negative and my entire pay check gets direct deposited tomorrow, and all they tell me at the restaurant is there is nothing they can do. HORRIBLE AWFUL WORST ever customer service from Corporate Fuddrucker's. The managers (Romero and Roland) have been very nice throughout but the company is total shit IMO.
