Horrible experience! This place is very misleading. We came here expecting 'seafood heaven' and food comparable to other buffets in Vegas but that wasn't the case. At $40 and an additional $15 for the VIP pass, we were not expecting this:

- Poor food quality: frozen oysters, miniature lobster tails, anorexic crab legs, and super dry prime rib 
- Little variety: pretty standard stuff, nothing you can't find at other buffets 
- Unlabeled food: NOTHING was labeled - I had to guess what I was eating
- Messy buffet stations and awful presentation of food.
- Blunt taste
- Disappointing desserts: very little choice and taste was meh EXCEPT for the peach cobbler (i think that's what it was ... it wasn't labeled so I can't exactly tell you)

On the upside, the waitress (Cindy) was very helpful and nice. 5 stars for her and that peach cobbler! Everything else was poopy. 

AVOID THIS BUFFET!
