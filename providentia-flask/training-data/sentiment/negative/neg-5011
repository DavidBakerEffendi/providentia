I went to this location at about 9:30 at night. It was one of those double drive thru's and I pulled in the first one, noticing that there was a red mustang in the next order menu, waiting to order. After a full minute (literally, not exaggerrating) I finally said "Hello?" A lady replied "I'll be right with you." I noticed the red car guy still at the next menu board. I waited for five minutes, still, no one took my order.  My patience were gone and I left to the McDonalds two miles down the road. On my way home, from my ten min. trip to McDs. I passed Burger King and spotted the red car guy still waiting to order. This was crazy. They didn't offer and explanation or apology,  just silence.
  Despite this occasion, previous trips to this location always rendered me unhappy, and this time I decided I'm not ever going back to that location.
