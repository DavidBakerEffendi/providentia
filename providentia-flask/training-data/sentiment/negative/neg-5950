Ugh..If I could give it 0 stars I would! We had a reservation for 2 for 6:45 we were already half way down the strip at 6:10 so we hurried and hustled all the way back to the restaurant and arrived at 6:40 and checked in...it was 105 outside so this was not easy! They never called us. Never sat us. Everytime we asked how much longer they told us 20 to 30 min. We waited for an hour without being sat. Eventually giving up and going to the buffet upstairs! Totally dissapointed! NEVER EVER GOING BACK!!!
