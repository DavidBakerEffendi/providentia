Shocking. I, too, used Uber Eats and ordered the Burrito Phorito with chicken and extra sauce. It showed up as a tortilla chock full of white rice, a few bits of cauliflower, and a few carrots. That's all. No chicken, no kimchee, no sauce (let alone "extra", as ordered), no cheese, stir-fried veg or cilantro-lime rice. And it definitely wasn't garnished with green onions. I don't recommend eating here. Waste of money, and I won't be back.
