My boyfriend and I just returned from Aladdin's and racked our brains trying to think of the last time we had food this terrible... he drew a blank, and I reached back a quarter century to the time my uncle bought me an inedible chili dog at South of the Border. Tonight is only the second time I have just left a meal sitting on its plate. I ordered the hummus schwarma plate, which consisted of 1) cardboard in a basket ("pita"); 2) hummus- not bad, actually; and 3) grizzled bland beef strips DIPPED IN CINNAMON. My boyfriend ordered the flavor savor sampler: 1) a few chicken strips, pretty good 2) hot sauce on salad, pretty good 3) "mediterranean rice" (bad buffet rice-a-roni vermicelli also DOUSED IN CINNAMON 4) gross sausage-and-other-components thing 4) falafel so full of raw spices it was actually gritty to eat. The food was not only badly prepared, it consisted of glaringly cheap ingredients. The restaurant was full, so maybe it was an off night? but given the quality and cheapness issues, can't imagine that's the case.
