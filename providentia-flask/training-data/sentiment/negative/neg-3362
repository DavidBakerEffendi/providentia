I would love to be able to give them a better rating ,however after several visits in the last month the inconsistency and the poor service and the workers who are not knowledgeable in proper customer service , I have to say that the only reason I return is my family's love of the actual bagels -- that is if they haven't run out before 10 am on any given day ! 

If you want or expect the best deal make sure to ask questions because they will not offer the best deal to you .
