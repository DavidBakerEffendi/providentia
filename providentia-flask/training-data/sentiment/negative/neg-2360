J.K. sushi?? Yeah because they are clearly a joke! How is this place still in business?!

California roll, shrimp tempura roll and egg rolls set me back $16 bucks! Worst sushi ever!! Old rice, stale, poorly assembled, not fresh and ugh, just so gross. I'll be amazed if I don't end up sick. 

Omg, no... Just no.
