There is no doubt that the late night crew here treats the customers MUCH BETTER than the manager Angie does.

I've been coming here nearly daily since I came to the area, and I usually order the carnitas plate. I like to get some of the pork fat with my carnitas. That's the best part.

However, this Angie lady, who I have been told is the manager, refuses to let me have any of the pork with the fat. I don't understand why, but she seems to have something against me.

I was treated so badly today, I will probably not be going back again. There's no corporate number or anything that I can call to address my concerns on how I was treated, and every restaurant I called, everyone who answers won't speak English, and then hangs up on me. 

Again I say, the night crew is MUCH BETTER at how they treat the customers. I'm specifically talking about this ANGIE person, as being the one who didn't want my business. It's a shame really, I used to like going there to eat.
