Went through the drive thru @ 9:00 pm and ordered 2 beef tacos and a bean Tostada. The server was pleasant and the food came pretty quickly.

The tacos were very thin meaning very little beef or lettuce, Taste was OK but not great.

The Tostada was better two very crisp shells and beans were OK as well but again not great. Not creamy like I like them and not very hot either.

I got green and red sauce which were pretty standard.

Something disagreed with my digestion and I ended up the next day on the throne all too many times.

Wish it was better as it is close to me and there aren't that many places to choose from in Sun City maybe I will head to El Mirage next time.
