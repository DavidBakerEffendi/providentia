I like this place!  Got there around 4p on a Sunday afternoon, sat in the bar area, very few others were there.  Lots of windows, tv action, nice bar, tables and chairs your run of the mill variety; looks like they have patio seating just outside.

Chips and salsa were good.  Got a bowl of Albondigas Soup, off the regular menu, was $4.95, a true bargain--the soup was terrific, had 4 good size meatballs, full off flavor as was the broth. I'd definitely come back just for that soup. 

UPDATE 10/16/15

So I came back for the soup.  It bore absolutely no resemblance to my earlier visit, was not good.  The house Margarita tasted more like water than anything else.  As goes the soup, goes the stars I previously awarded, so I've downgraded my review.  Won't be returning.
