Unless raw chicken is your bag, I say skip coming to the Arrogant Butcher.  I ordered the Crab Stuffed Chicken for dinner, and the 1st few bites were fine, but when I got to a thicker part of the chicken, the entire inside was fleshy-pink and raw.  We told the waitress and spoke to the manager, and instead of taking that dish off the bill entirely, they discounted our bill by $6.  The dish was $23, so that really did not remedy the situation.  We will definitely not be returning to this establishment.
