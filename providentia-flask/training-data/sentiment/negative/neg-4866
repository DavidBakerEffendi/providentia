Hands down the worst food you can possibly feed your family.  For nearly 20 dollars per person, you get the coldest nastiest, sushi and Chinese food combo.  If you are feeling constipated before going you will ultimately feel relief shortly after leaving.. do not eat the food prior to long road trips or your vehicle and anyone in the car with you will regret the substantial amount of diarrhea you will have.  To the owner: not sure why you sacrifice quality for quantity because the McDonald's next door is supreme in this category.  I keep getting dragged here by my mother because she has no taste buds and an iron stomach.  I would compare this to the sugar free gummy bear challenge. Some of the comments from my kids are as follows:

Oh god why this place?
Can I just eat the white rice?
Can I stay home next time?
My stomach hurts, thanks dad..
I don't want to go..
Why is the food cold?
I feel sick from the food. (Followed by gastric distress and tears)
