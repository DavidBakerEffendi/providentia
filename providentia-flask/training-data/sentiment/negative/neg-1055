WOW. This was bad. Most of it ended up in the trash, except for the meat...which I've cleaned up for my Dobe and Doxie.

This was the first time I tried City BBQ in Ballantyne after it being highly recommended. Ordered a Family Pack - which includes 1 lb of the meat of your choice, 4 standard or lunch buns, 2 sides (pints), and cornbread. I chose pulled pork and standard buns.

Went to pick it up and everything was kept in an oven type thing next to the checkout. Thought that was pretty cool. However, when I drove 0.5 miles and got it into the house, it was lukewarm at best.

Service when picking up: the guy was extremely friendly and pulled my order together within a good amount of time. He did ask me...did I want sauce with my order. What? Why would I buy BBQ without sauce? This should be standard. It was not an additional charge, but I was kind of stunned by that question. 

The Pork: Their pulled pork is pretty tasty when you can get to it. My order is filled with fatty tissue and flabby skin. I'm not accustomed to that at all. I'd say 1/4 of the 1 lb (I guess) that was included was waste. I actually tried to make a sandwich from the pork and 'original sauce'. Just not good. I've cleaned the pork out for my dogs. 

Mac and Cheese: Pretty sure they are using Velveeta. Would never order this again.

Baked Beans with 'Brisket': I had high hopes for this. I found two pieces of brisket in my pint, the rest were skin and fat pieces. Why???

Buns - standard, and kind of dried out
Cornbread - standard

I don't get why people are giving this place the thumbs up. :(
