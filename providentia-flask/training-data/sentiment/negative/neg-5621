We were in a golf tournament on Saturday with 60 other golfers. After we finished, we headed to the restaurant for lunch. 
To our surprise, there were no servers to be seen. I went up to the bar and there was only one bartender and i told him where we were sitting and he said he'd get us a menu. After about ten minutes, one of us got up and retreived them. Another 10 minutes went by and no server. 
We waited until the results were announced and still no server. So we went someplace else for lunch.
You would think that with a large group, they would be well staffed. They lost a lot of business that day.
